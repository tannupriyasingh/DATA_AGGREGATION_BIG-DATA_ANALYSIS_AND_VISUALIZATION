SINGAPORE — The Latest on the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which ends Thursday in Singapore (all times local):
2:35 p.m.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (LEE KUH'-chiang) has told fellow Asian leaders the region needs to send a strong positive message to markets about sticking to trade rules and open markets.
Li spoke Thursday at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian nations. He also reassured China's neighbors that Beijing's "Belt and Road" infrastructure initiative will help support peace and stability in the region.
Li says the region needs to "take concrete action to uphold the rules-based free trade regime and to send a message — a positive message — to the market to provide stable, predictable and law-based conditions for the market."
His comments come amid mounting concern over debts associated with projects financed by Beijing that are part of the effort to nurture trade and logistics networks linked to China.

1:35 p.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence says another U.S.-North Korean summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is likely after the beginning of the year.
Pence said Thursday that the meeting would "put details on paper" for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. would continue putting "maximum pressure" on North Korea until then.
Pence spoke on the sidelines of a Southeast Asian summit in Singapore.
He also says Trump plans to discuss Beijing's unique role regarding North Korea when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina at the G-20 summit later this month. He says the U.S. is also working very closely with South Korea and respects the talks it is holding with Pyongyang.

10:05 a.m.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence says America has a steadfast and enduring commitment to the Indo-Pacific region but wants cooperation, not control.
Pence, who is standing in for President Donald Trump, told a summit of Southeast Asian leaders Thursday in Singapore that "empire and aggression have no place" in the region. The comment appeared to allude to growing Chinese sway in the region and its vast claims in the South China Sea.
Pence said, "Like you, we seek an Indo-Pacific in which all nations, large and small, can prosper and thrive - secure in our sovereignty, confident in our values, and growing stronger together."
The meetings of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Nations focus on enhanced trade and security in a region of more than 630 million people.

The news site, the Liberty Torch, has been started by a group of students at Liberty University. Jack Panyard, a student, initiated the creation of the news site, according to the Lynchburg News & Advance.
Panyard was dismissed as editor-in-chief of the university’s official newspaper, the Liberty Champion after tensions came to a head over the summer with university officials and Panyard’s oversight.
The university’s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., denied a student’s column which focused on obscene comments made from President Donald Trump in the Champion during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Falwell, known to be a strong supporter of Trump, removed the article because it was “redundant” with another student’s pro-Hillary Clinton letter to the editor on the opinion page.
Panyard and his co-editors said they encountered related issues during their time as reporters and editors at the Champion and wanted to create a new platform without Liberty University’s “bumper rails.”
Falwell wrote in a conservative news outlet, Newsmax, that he did not censor the students’ work, but wanted to make sure the students were not replicating the same content.
The new site’s focus, The Torch, looks to tackle controversial topics which they feel the students of Liberty University have a higher interest in reading.

Impulse is coming!
Published on February 4, 2008 By Draginol In Personal Computing
Since 1999, Stardock has been a pioneer in digital distribution. The original Galactic Civilizations was the first PC game to be released at retail and digitally at the same time. Its flag-ship product, Object Desktop, made the transition from being a retail product to being digitally distributed with a subscription in 1999.
For the past few years, Stardock has distributed its content with Stardock Central:
Stardock Central
And while Stardock Central was very cutting edge when it was launched back in 2003, it's getting a bit long in the tooth. For the past year, Stardock has been working on a new platform that will finally combine Stardock's various technological assets into a single place. This new platform is called Impulse.
Impulse
Impulse isn't just a cosmetic make-over of Stardock Central. It greatly expands the capabilities of Stardock's digital distribution offerings.
Here are 5 key differentiators of Impulse:
Users do not have to load Impulse to use the software or games.
Impulse will support third-parties submitting their software or game, name their price, and then after review having it available -- all done nearly automatically. Stardock already has this system in place on WinCustomize.com with "Master" themes.
Impulse will integrate its next-generation social networking features in the Community tab that will let users have friends, chat about games, have blogs, and more.
Impulse includes built in support for backing up your purchase to CD/DVD.
Impulse allows users who buy software or games at retail to still manage their updates and re-download the entire product on Impulse (for products that support this feature).
Impulse provides a cleaner UI than Stardock Central.
Managing your software on Impulse is a snap. If you bought a game or software program at retail or even from another digital distributor, you may be able to still manage updates and such on Impulse.
Impulse is still in internal beta at Stardock but it expects to release it in mid February with additional features for it being added through the course of the year.

The interface looks great. but a couple of questions..
1) Will there be a skin browser?
2) Will there be integrated Chat (IRC)?
3) Will SDC still work in the long term?

Frogboy
on Feb 04, 2008
1) No. Not integrated anyway. As you may have noticed, it's difficult to maintain both the download client and an integrated skin browser.
2) Yes.
3) For quite awhile yes. SDC won't be disappearing any time soon.

This looks great! I'm really interested in the idea of submitting software, is your goal to be an alternative to sites like Plimus and RegNow, or is it still more of a distributor/portal type of deal? I can see how its probably somewhere in between, which would really be a great idea!

Syrian Troops Seize Back Strategic Town in Homs
Tweet
TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian forces seized full control of a strategic town in Homs after they flushed the ISIL terrorists out of the Western province.
A senior Syrian military source, speaking on condition anonymity, said that the country's Tiger Forces made huge gains in their military campaign against the ISIL in Homs province and succeeded in recapturing Jazal Gas Fields and the town of Jazal from the Takfiri group.
The army troops plan to liberate an approach road to Palmyra in the second phase of their operation in an attempt to prepare the ground for Palmyra liberation.
The ISIL terrorists recently overran Palmyra in central Homs in an attempt to take full control of the ancient city, but were pushed back by the Syrian troops.
The ISIL Takfiri terrorists currently control shrinking swathes of Syria and Iraq. They have threatened all communities, including Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, Ezadi Kurds and others, as they continue their atrocities in Iraq.
Senior Iraqi officials have blamed Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and some Persian Gulf Arab states for the growing terrorism in their country.
The ISIL has links with Saudi intelligence and is believed to be indirectly supported by the Israeli regime.

UPDATED: Dozens of IRGC Members Martyred in Terrorist Attack in Southeastern Iran
Tweet
TEHRAN (FNA)- Dozens of Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) members were killed or wounded after their bus came under a terrorist attack in Iran's Southeastern Sistan and Balouchestan province on Wednesday evening.
The bus was carrying IRGC personnel on a road from the city of Khash to the provincial capital of Zahedan when a truck loaded with explosives and moving alongside the bus detonated.
A statement released by the Quds Base of the IRGC's Ground Force said the bus was carrying a group of IRGC personnel "coming back from a border guarding mission when it came under a suicide car attack by Takfiri terrorists", but did not mention the number of passengers.
"27 IRGC members have been martyred and 13 others wounded in the terrorist attack so far," the statement said, and further blamed "the intelligence services of hegemonic system - a phrase used normally to refer to the United States and its allies - and Zionism for supporting the attack".
The US officials have repeatedly stressed that they would take every possible measure to pressure Tehran, including support for groups operating against Iran. The incident came hours before the start of a US-sponsored security conference against Iran in Warsaw, Poland.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News last month that Washington would jointly host a global summit focused on Iran and the Middle East in Poland in February, but senior US diplomats later softened tone to shift the conference title to security in the Middle-East, denying that Iran will top or be the main agenda. The gathering takes place in Warsaw from February 13 to 14, the US State Department said in a statement.
Meantime, Jeish Al-Adl, a Pakistan-based radical Wahhabi terrorist group staging cross border attacks into Southeastern Iran from South-West Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement.
The group has bases in Southwestern Pakistan and started operations nearly 6 years ago after recruiting the remnants of Jundullah notorious terrorist group and reorganizing them. Iran had captured leaders of Jundullah notorious Wahhabi terrorist group and dismantled the terrorist organization years earlier.
In mid October, the group abducted 14 Iranian Basijis (volunteer forces) and border guards at Mirjaveh border in Southeastern Sistan-Balouchestan province. Five were released a month later on November 15.
The IRGC Ground Force then blamed foreign intelligence services for supporting and assisting the terrorist group.
Jeish al-Adl also abducted five Iranian border guards in Jakigour region of Sistan and Balouchestan Province and took them to Pakistan in 2014. After two months of abduction, four of them were released and the fifth one was killed. His body was returned to Iran months later.
Then early in March, 2015, Pakistani sources told the country's media that authorities in Southwestern Pakistan had arrested the ringleader of Jeish al-Adl terrorist group as he was traveling on a bus from the lawless border area.
Salam Rigi, cousin of the Jundollah terrorist group's ringleader Abdolmalek Rigi, was seized by Pakistani authorities who were tipped off to his movements and intercepted the bus some 50 km from Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan, a security official said on the condition of anonymity.
Salam Rigi was accused of involvement in suicide bombings in Iran and Pakistan, as well as sending terrorists to the conflicts in Iraq and Syria.
Other sources said the terrorist arrested was Abdo-Sattar Rigi (Abdolmalek's brother), explaining that he was carrying his cousin's ID card at the time of arrest, but further investigations revealed his true identity.
Later reports proved that the captured terrorist was Abdo-Sattar Rigi.
Abdo-Sattar (the third of the notorious Rigi brothers) headed the Jeish al-Nasr terrorist group, but his cousin Salam leads Jeish al-Adl.
Abdo-Sattar's two older brothers, Abdolmalek and Abdolhamid Rigi, who led the more powerful terrorist group, Jundollah, were both captured and condemned to death by Iran earlier.
In early 2009, Abdolhamid Rigi, the Jundullah terrorist group's number two man and brother of its ringleader Abdolmalek Rigi, was arrested by Iranian security forces.
Abdolhamid had conducted a number of bombing operations and other violent attacks in Iran resulting in many casualties and was sentenced to death by the court in 2009, but his execution was delayed on several occasions. Officials did not mention any specific reason for the delayed execution of Abdolhamid at the time.
Iran arrested Abdolmalek Rigi, the number one man of the Jundollah terrorist group in late February 2011. Abdolmalek was executed in June 2011.
Iranian military and police officials voice concern over the presence of terrorist groups in Pakistan's territories, criticizing the Pakistani army and border police's lax control over shared borders.
The two sides' state and military officials have exchanged frequent visits to enhance anti-terrorism cooperation specially in border regions. In early December, top security officials from Iran and Pakistan met in Iran’s Southeastern city of Zahedan to hold the 22nd joint meeting on border cooperation between the two countries.
Late in October, Commander of the IRGC Ground Force Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour announced his forces' preparedness to launch joint operations against the terrorists who abducted the Iranian border guards in Southeastern Iran.
"We have had different contacts with the Pakistani army and urged them to guarantee extradition of the outlaws and healthiness of the abductees and they should show more responsibility," General Pakpour said, referring to the fate of the 9 border guards that are still kept by Jeish Al-Adl.
"These terrorists have a stronghold and a base on Pakistan's soil and we are prepared for any joint operations with the Pakistani army against the outlaws to release the hostages," he added.

Israeli ex-general, polling closest to Netanyahu, joins 2019 election race

Israel to escalate fight against Iran in Syria after US exit: Netanyahu
A former Israeli armed forces chief who opinion polls show poses the toughest challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s bid for reelection next year formally established a political party on Thursday.
Details about Benny Gantz’s Israel Resilience Party, leaked to local media after it was registered, gave little indication of its ideological tilt.
Along with preserving Israel as “a Jewish and democratic country”, the party pledged unspecified changes to priorities in national security and the economy.
Polling has predicted an easy win for Netanyahu in the April 9 election, with his rightist Likud party taking around 30 of parliament’s 120 seats and on course to form a right-wing coalition government similar to the current cabinet.
The surveys, published after Netanyahu announced on Monday an election some seven months before one was due by law, gave second place to a then-hypothetical Gantz party. The polls forecast it would take around 15 seats.
Netanyahu is running for a fifth term under the shadow of three corruption investigations in which police have recommended his indictment. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Israel’s attorney-general has still to decide whether to charge Netanyahu and it is unclear whether he will make his announcement before the election.
Should Gantz emerge as a center-left candidate, that could work in Netanyahu’s favor by further fracturing an already disparate opposition bloc.
Gantz, 59, became Israel’s top general in 2011 after stints as commander of forces on the combustible northern frontier with Syria and Lebanon and as military attache in Washington. During his four-year term he oversaw two Israeli offensive on Gaza Strip.

Judge: City broke law in fluoridating
Source: The Union Leader | Union Leader Staff
Posted on June 7th, 2002
Location: United States, New Hampshire
A judge has ruled that Manchester city officials violated state law when they introduced fluoride into the regional water supply 18 months ago. He ordered it shut off by April 1, 2004.
In the meantime, Superior Court Judge Robert J. Lynn ruled on Tuesday, Manchester city officials could either get state law changed or hold referenda in six neighboring towns.
In his ruling, Lynn stuck closely to the wording of state law, which requires a public hearing and referendum in any town or city where fluoride is added to a public water supply.
When Manchester held a 1999 referendum on fluoridation, only Manchester residents voted on the issue, even though about 40,000 people who live outside the city rely on Manchester Water Works for their water.
Fluoridation opponents hailed the ruling.
“Obviously we’ve known all the time we were right,” said fluoride foe Lloyd Basinow, an original plaintiff who was later dropped from the suit. “It was a matter of the court going along with us. But there’s no reason for delay.”
Gerhard Bedding, executive director of the New Hampshire Pure Water Coalition, said the ruling could apply to water systems in Laconia, Dover and Portsmouth, which sell significant amounts of water outside their borders.
To a lesser extent, it could affect Durham and Rochester, he said. He called on Manchester officials to voluntarily stop fluoridation immediately.
The ruling took city and state officials by surprise. Manchester Mayor Robert Baines said he would confer with Water Works officials and others before discussing details.
But he said Manchester voters adopted fluoridation, so it is the responsibility of city officials to see the will of the voters is carried out.
When they filed a lawsuit last year, opponents of fluoridation sidestepped scientific issues about the benefit and safety of fluoride.
Rather, their main claim was that residents in portions of Auburn, Bedford, Derry, Goffstown, Hooksett and Londonderry were disenfranchised in the Manchester referendum.
Lynn agreed.
At one point in his ruling, Lynn wrote that the law “should be interpreted to mean what it says.”
“It necessarily follows that where a single supplier services more than one municipality, there must be a hearing and vote in each of said municipalities,” Lynn ruled.
But Lynn believes the Legislature never contemplated a situation where a single water supplier pipes water to more than one town.
The ruling “creates difficulties of its own,” he acknowledged.
For fluoridation to continue, each town would have to hold a referendum, Lynn hypothesized.
The referendum would have to be townwide, even if only a fraction of town residents are hooked up to Manchester Water Works. (In Auburn, for example, only 4 to 8 percent of town residents receive water from the city.)
And if only one of the seven municipalities were to deny fluoridation, the fluoridation would have to stop systemwide, Lynn ruled. That is because Water Works cannot practically separate fluoridated and unfluoridated water.
Lynn noted that at least three other multi-jurisdictional water suppliers have implemented fluoridation through the procedure that his ruling struck down.
Attorney Jed Z. Callen, who represented the 19 people who challenged the referendum, identified those communities as Portsmouth, Concord and Durham.
Bernie Lucey, senior water supply engineer at the state Department of Environmental Services, said some water companies have many customers outside their borders; others only a handful.
Durham’s well is in Lee and a handful of Lee houses along the pipeline are served. By contrast, Portsmouth has customers in Rye, Greenland, Newington, New Castle and Madbury.
Concord has fewer than a dozen customers in Bow.
Public health officials said it was too early to say what happens next.
“Certainly, the judge’s decision isn’t about the safety of fluoride; it was a matter of law,” said city Health Officer Fred Rusczek. Fluoridation continues to be one of the most effective measures possible to improve the dental health of the community, he said.
But Bedding noted that the hydrofluorisilic acid used by Manchester Water Works contains trace amounts of arsenic and lead. Goals set by the Environmental Protection Agency call for no lead or arsenic in drinking water, he said.
Brook Dupee, a public health official with the state Department of Health and Human Services, said the loss of fluoridation will hurt poor families that do not have access to dental care.
Twenty percent of individuals develop 80 percent of tooth decay, he said.
Dupee said it’s possible the state would join with the city to appeal the ruling.
The water users in the six towns receive water either directly from Manchester Water Works or from a wholesale water company.
Auburn has 315 water users; Bedford, 5,300; Derry, 15,000; Goffstown, 6,000; Hooksett, 6,200; Londonderry, 5,600.

Police Chief Raises Concerns Over State Plan To Legalize Marijuana
Mar 4, 2019 3:24 PM
By Valerie Gordon
After Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s State of the State address last month, it became clear that the state will pursue a plan to legalize the possession and distribution of recreational marijuana—and that local municipalities will have the option to opt out of the plan, if the governor’s proposal is ultimately approved.
Legalizing recreational marijuana would undoubtedly present challenges to local East End law enforcement officers, according to Southampton Town Police Chief Steven Skrynecki. And whether municipalities should opt out is not a simple decision to make, according to Southampton Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman.
Prior to making a decision, the supervisor plans to meet with local school administrators, health professionals, businesses, and parents, as well as take into consideration local law enforcement concerns.
Chief Skrynecki referred to a report from the New England Journal of Medicine that suggests that marijuana use influences addictive behavior. Reading from a letter dated January 17, from the New York State Association of Chiefs of Police—of which Chief Skrynecki is a member—he said, “New York State is currently battling an opioid epidemic with law enforcement and public health professionals on the front line, and it would be counterintuitive to condone the use of marijuana.”
In 2017, Southampton Town Police reported that 19 individuals died from opioid overdoses. In 2018, that number dropped to six. At a recent opioid forum, held at the Dormition of the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Church of the Hamptons on February 6, local and state lawmakers, including Mr. Schneiderman, vowed to do whatever it takes to get that number down to zero.
Chief Skrynecki said he fears the number of overdoses could increase if marijuana is legalized in New York.
He explained that even if the state legalized it, marijuana is illegal under federal law and classified as a “Schedule 1” drug, meaning that the federal government views cannabis as highly addictive with no medical value. Marijuana is also often referred to as a “gateway drug” that some say leads to the use of opioids, such as heroin.
“It’s a lot easier for us when federal and state laws are compatible,” Chief Skrynecki said. “I will take the position that the state chiefs association has taken.”
However, Mr. Schneiderman explained that the legalization of marijuana could potentially have the opposite effect on the number of opioid deaths on the East End—people might be less likely to use prescription painkillers and heroin if there was a legal substitute.
“There’s a lot of pot being used already—somehow they’re managing to get it,” he said. “I don’t think it would lead to more opioid use.”
And although state lawmakers are still figuring out the logistics when it comes to taxing, licensing and regulating the drug, Mr. Schneiderman said state regulation would ensure the product was safe.
“My biggest fear is it could be laced with fentanyl if people are buying it on the street—that’s a big problem,” he said. “If you can regulate it, at least you know it’s safe.”
Mr. Schneiderman’s counterpart in East Hampton, Peter Van Scoyoc, did not return requests for comment this week. Additionally, several law enforcement officers—including East Hampton Town Police Chief Michael Sarlo, Captain Christopher Anderson, and Sag Harbor Village Police Chief Austin McGuire—did not return multiple requests for comment over the past several weeks.
Chief Skrynecki remained skeptical about the nuts and bolts of making marijuana legal. He anticipated that New York State would require distributors to obtain a license for selling marijuana, similar to that of a liquor license, noting that those overhead costs would drive up the price of the product and making it more lucrative for those willing to sell it illegally.
“If I’m growing marijuana and selling it under the table, I’m probably going to beat your price,” Chief Skrynecki said. “If marijuana is legal and the store is offering it for $20 and I am offering it for $10 because my overhead is less, who are you buying from?”
Because of that, he said the estimated $300 million in tax revenue expected from the legalization is not accurate.
Mr. Schneiderman disagreed. “If it becomes legal, people will pay more if they have to buy it legally and not take the risk,” he said on Thursday, February 21. “I think law enforcement will do their job to crack down on any illegal sales.”
He estimated that Suffolk County’s cut of the state’s $300 million tax revenue would equate to roughly $20 million annually from the sale of marijuana. However, Southampton Town, which collects only property taxes and not sales tax, would see only trickle-down effects from those funds, such as an increase in county funding for public transportation, homeless shelters and health clinics.
Aside from health-related issues, Chief Skrynecki said that law enforcement officers are also concerned with how legalization will impact public and traffic safety.
Unlike driving under the influence of alcohol, which can be tested via a Breathalyzer, he said it’s much more difficult, as well as expensive, to detect someone driving under the influence of marijuana. He explained that the detection of impaired driving must be performed by a New York State certified Drug Recognition Expert, or DRE officer.
He added that the department will be sending its first officer to complete the month-long certification training in the coming months, but he anticipated that at least two or three more officers would need to undergo the training before marijuana is legalized.
The training, which has been approved by both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, consists of two phases: academic training and field certifications.
Phase one includes instruction in physiology, vital signs, standardized field sobriety testing and different drug indicators. Students must achieve a minimum score of 80 percent on their examinations and must demonstrate proficiency in administering field tests in order to progress to phase two.
Field certifications consist of a minimum of 12 successful evaluations of drug impaired individuals. Each student has to identify subjects under the influence of four of the seven drug categories, according to the state.
The New York State Association of Chiefs of Police estimated that law enforcement agencies would need to add approximately 650 new drug recognition experts statewide to handle the suspected increase in impaired drivers.
In comparing data in Colorado, which legalized marijuana in 2013, Chief Skrynecki said traffic fatalities increased by 62 percent within the first year. Additionally, he said the state’s violent crime rate increased by 18.6 percent—or 11 times faster than the rest of the nation since its legalization. Property-related crimes also increased by 8.3 percent.
“We have enough people that are driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs already, and we have our share of serious auto accidents,” he said. “We’re hoping to not see similar stats here, but we suspect we will.”
Mr. Schneiderman, however, was skeptical that those increases were a direct result of legalized marijuana. “Sometimes these percentages can be deceiving,” he said.
The supervisor noted that before the Town Board makes a decision on whether to opt out of the plan, he plans to look at the impacts other states have seen since the drug’s legalization. “I’m not in a hurry to make a decision on this,” he said.
Chief Skrynecki plans to meet with Mr. Schneiderman in the coming weeks to discuss his concerns, noting that they have just “scratched the surface” of reaching a decision.
“We want the legislation here to be fully aware of these issues,” he said. “I’m not asking them to make a decision one way or another—I’m just trying to make sure that they are educated to the things that we as police chiefs have seen and heard.”
As for Mr. Schneiderman, he said, “I don’t like government playing parent too much. If you’re an adult, you should be able to make decisions for yourself. This is a personal choice.”

Really? Sure why not. We opt out of enforcing local safety regulations on motel owners housing year round residents, we opt out of having the water department provide clean, safe drinking water, and we ignore our Federal immigration laws when pulling over non-licensed, uninsured motorists so why not ignore this law as well.

Well then, keep the money in the hands of criminals, instead of taxpayers. Go ahead opt out. People will find a way to demand the supply of that which they desire. And, many criminals will be more than happy to take their money. Cannabis being "Schedule 1" is absolute horse****. It's about as addictive as chocolate. The real "gateway drug" in the opioid crisis is prescription opiates. Thank you, Big Pharma.
Local law enforcement is considering continuing a prohibition created by a ...more bigoted owner of a newspaper/timber empire, and a petrochemical company responsible for poisoning the environment. Up to and including killing a farmer's entire herd of cows with POFAs dumped into a local river. Ironic that June 14 became Flag Day...

Three key positive points for legalization of cannabis:
Decrease in legal expenses both personal and tax dollars for a non violent act that harms no one.
Decrease in arresting minorities and the lifelong impact from an arrest record.
Increase in awareness (MANY people use regularly currently) and options for treatment.
I can go on and on.
History has proven that legal consequence DOES NOT reduce drug use. Lets try treatment instead of ruining lives though the legal system. ...more

Chief Skrynecki is a cop. To a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
Instead of continuing the criminalization of drugs, a policy that has seen their use skyrocket, why not try education (as has been done SUCCESSFULLY in Portugal) and investment in pharmaceutical research to find therapeutic drugs to break the hold of (some) recreational drugs?
The chief's risible notion of making Southampton Town an island of abstinence in a sea of aficionados illustrates his institutional prejudice. ...more

That is incorrect. The only thing the study found was that the number of legal opiate prescriptions written through Medicare Part D decreased in states where medical marijuana was available. It said absolutely nothing about illegal opiate use, overdoses, or addiction rates or how recreational marijuana factored in.

Local, it seems like a credible study. It looks to be widely accepted as a sound study. What is the problem with it? Maybe to small a population number?
Feb 24, 19 7:39 PM appended by Fred s
From DRUGABUSE.com “About 60 percent of the nation’s fatal opioid overdoses occur among patients who have legitimate prescriptions for their medications. In states where medical marijuana is legal, however, a legitimate opiate user is able to significantly decrease his or her dosage, making overdose less likely.”

The study is definitely a valid study. However my point is that it was being referenced in a misleading way. Btw, your citation to the information promulgated by drugabuse.com is also inaccurate. That website is not an independent non-profit research group - they are a for-profit drug treatment facility corporation. The real numbers from NIDA show that in 2017 deaths from prescription opioid overdoses were only 35% of all opioid overdoses, and only 23% did not involve the simultaneous use of other ...more illegal synthetic drugs. My point about the study was that it only looked at small a fraction of that 35% - only those in that group who were using Medicare Part D to get their prescription. So any small decrease in opioid overdoses due to the availability of medical marijuana in that very small group is not nearly as significant as was being portrayed. Plus the discussion is about recreational marijuana which had absolutely no factor or involvement in the study whatsoever. I just think it’s reckless to make claims about how “great” marijuana is by citing inaccurate information.

Local, this from Forbes.....Most opioid use disorder and overdose cases occurred in patients with legitimate prescriptions from health care professionals for pain management. Marijuana liberalization, therefore, may have benefited these patients by providing them with legal protection and access to marijuana as an alternative relief from their pain conditions,” the Kentucky and Emory team wrote. “The widespread public support will bring medical marijuana laws to more and more states ...more for years to come, which may help decrease the use of prescription opioids in pain management and the adverse consequences, such as opioid use disorder and overdose.”

Fred you keep obtusely avoiding the point and conflating topics. That study was about medical marijuana only. No one objects to medical marijuana, which is used for medical treatment in controlled lower doses supervised by a physician. The topic of this article and Cuomo’s new law is about recreational marijuana. Recreational marijuana is not for medical use and there is no evidence that it reduces opioid overdoses. People are rightfully concerned about legalizing recreational marijuana.

From the data I saw, Colorado's rate of overdoses decreased in comparison to the country-wide rate following the start of legal recreational marijuana in 2014.

Cannabis being illegal is super silly but the way it is being legalized is disgusting, a huge corporate money grab. CGC, TLRY, CRON and others have been a roller coaster ride over the past year. Corporate tobacco and alcohol companies are buying cannabis companies and will target cannabis to vulnerable, young people the same way they did with their other products. Concentrates are increasing in popularity and while fun to an experienced, knowledgeable user, they maximize some of the worst side-effects ...more and eliminate many benefits. I prefer flowers grown in dirt outdoors in the sunlight but this seems to be increasingly rare.

Maybe along with the subsidized housing that the Town of Southampton is building using our property taxes, the Town could grow marijuana in the land provided by the Community Preservation Fund and then sell the dope in the house on Main Street in Hampton Bays that the Town couldn't rent to the Autism charity, and staff this new store with undocumented immigrants that the Town houses in subsidized housing -- a truly virtuous circle!

The Chief is grandstanding and I think 27 East should have looked into the facts to see if he can do this. I hope that the Chief can interpret the proposed law law better than it appears.
“both individual counties and cities with more than 100,000 residents to opt out – and therefore not permit cultivation or retail pot facilities in their jurisdictions – if their governing body adopts an ordinance, law or resolution to “completely prohibit the establishment or ...more operation” of any of the pot-licensed entities Cuomo is proposing. Those localities that permit them are barred from enacting their own local-specific laws regulating growers, distributors or retailers, except for such things as setting times and places where pot can be sold.”
I maybe wrong, but the last time I knew it, Southampton was a Township, not a county or city, so Southampton can’t do anything.

Next h'e going to propose making alcohol illegal again and perhaps return us to horse and buggy days to avoid the pollution of gas propelled vehicles.
Time to remove one more dinosaur from ...more office.

The number of opiod deaths in 2018 is wrong, it is 7 not six. Your didnt count my daughter Chief. How many others werent counted so we can show we re making progress in the war on drugs. Heroin is everywhere in this town now. Why is anyone wasting their time on marijuana sales?

As I drove my ridiculously large, pollution-spewing vehicle past the Res today, I realized that no matter what the Town/County does, MJ will be available for purchase on the Reservation. I hope they grow it also : ) Did I mention I enjoy smoking illegal schedule 1 marijuana but that it's been a while as I'm quite busy?

There's already too many banners advertising the price for a carton of cigarettes. What comes next, price banners for weed?

Yes, the near future will have banners on the Res advertising prices for herb. After that come legal prostitution. Making things illegal doesn't make them disappear, it only maximizes harm and focuses that harm on the poorest members of society. A wide range of illegal substances and transactional sex have been readily available on the South Fork for well over 100 years.

Apple Reportedly Dumps Intel's Upcoming 5G Modem for 2020 iPhone
Apple Reportedly Dumps Intel's Upcoming 5G Modem for 2020 iPhone
Apple released its iPhone X last year	
Melba Vasquez | 06 July, 2018, 18:19	
Apple was thought to be the "key mobile customer" this chip was relying on for sales, meaning Intel wanted it in iPhones and iPads. The iPhone maker has reportedly notified Intel about development. It is also said that the fresh decision has pushed the Santa Clara, California-headquartered company to halt the development of its chip that will combine a 5G, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth chip under one build and redirected its engineers to other operations. According to Calcalis, Apple has informed the chip firm that the 2020 iPhone won't be using Intel 5G modems.
In a statement given to INQ, an Intel spokesperson said: "Intel's 5G customer engagements and roadmap have not changed for 2018 through 2020".
Apple and Qualcomm might be entangled in lawsuits and jeopardizing their relations, but the Cupertino company is reportedly looking to drop Intel as a chip manufacturer as well.
In November it was thought that Intel had a good chance of being Apple's 5G modem supplier due to their ongoing fight with Qualcomm.
A separate report from Israeli publication CTech suggests that Apple is - for now - ending its plan to work with Intel on 5G modems. "We remain committed to our 5G plans and projects". At the same time, though, heavyweight Qualcomm has been crowing of its growing 5G traction-Qualcomm in February said more than a dozen handset makers around the world have selected its Snapdragon X50 5G NR modem to power their forthcoming 5G phones, an announcement the company argued gives it a 12- to 18-month lead on its competitors in the 5G arena. But Apple probably isn't going to have an iPhone ready for 5G until much later, with 2020 being our best bet for a 5G iPhone.
Kuo also expects that the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Plus - or whatever Apple calls the larger sequel to the iPhone X - will come in three colors: black, white, and gold. We will have to wait and see what solution Apple comes up with if they decide to ditch Intel.

Commentary: A Plea for Increased Security at Barlow, From a Former Student
February 27, 2018 Susan	
I sat on the cold tile floor, huddled in the closet of Joel Barlow High School with sixteen of my classmates. My teacher cried and armed us each with glass beakers; we were in science class. He tearfully explained, “for defense…just in case.” This was the Monday after twenty first graders and six adults were brutally shot down in their elementary school classrooms, in an event that left the world stunned by a crime unprecedented in its horror. We were on lockdown for reports of a man with a gun; it was a false alarm, but tensions were high. The Friday before, I did the exact same thing; I sat on the cold tile floor, huddled with my classmates, checking news updates on our phones; reports that 26 people were slaughtered in cold blood. They were being murdered in their place of learning, just 11 short miles away from where we currently sat.
The events that took place in December 2012 have shaped me as a person, and shaped my entire experience as a student at Barlow. I was a freshman at JBHS in 2012, and since those two days in December, I have never felt safe in that building. That being said, I knew that Joel Barlow would step up and make changes. I knew that Connecticut as a state, would come together, and work to prevent another tragedy like this; how could we not? It happened in our own backyard. To our neighbors. To our friends. To the teams our kids play sports against. To the parents we grocery shop with. To the families who live on roads we drive everyday, and to the town we love to visit in the summer for their famous ice cream.
But I was wrong. Joel Barlow never stepped up. They never took action. They never made a change. They failed me. They failed all of their students.
Security and safety are the cornerstone of learning; you cannot learn if you do not feel safe. And I never felt truly safe at Joel Barlow. I never felt as safe as I should have given the severity of a situation so close to home. Now, five years after the Sandy Hook massacre that so greatly affected our community, we sit and mourn yet another school shooting. I am absolutely disgusted, and disheartened by the lack of change that my community has made in protecting our town’s most vulnerable, and I demand change.
Joel Barlow currently employs three security staff members during the day, with one on duty at night, but no one at the school is trained as a police officer, none of the security guards carry weapons, and the school does not have a school resource officer. I am calling for immediate change and action. Following Sandy Hook, an armed officer and an SRO was sent to both the elementary schools, and the middle schools, but not the high school. Why? Why aren’t all of our students being protected? Why aren’t all of our student’s granted the right to feel safe at school? Why are we picking and choosing?
School Superintendent Thomas McMorran said he believes the current security structure in place at Barlow is sufficient, but I disagree. As a student at Joel Barlow, I continued to watch a group of guards continuously follow the same handful of “troublemakers” to and from the bathroom; often leaving their guard station. I continued to watch my classmates walk in and out of the building during school hours, when they were not supposed to, with no questions asked; no one knew that they were leaving and entering. I also continued to watch faulty, desensitized lockdown drills be treated like complete jokes. I recall drills where teachers broke protocol and continued teaching, and I even had a drill in which a substitute teacher didn’t know how to lock the door. What if that had been a real, active-shooter situation?
We are a town that prides ourselves in our school system, yet we are failing to provide our high school students with the basic safety, comfort, and support that we provide to the rest of our school systems. It is absolutely imperative that Joel Barlow steps up and takes necessary actions to further protect its students by adding an armed officer, and SRO to its security plan, while also reviewing outdated lockdown protocols, and re-training faculty members. This has been an issue that has been ignored for far too long, and I am more than ready for the safety of our high schoolers to be taken seriously.

Redding and Easton parents are invited to attend this Weston event.
A Presentation by Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence
Weston Middle School Library
24 School Road, Weston CT
February 28, 2018
6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
(Inclement weather make-up date March 7, 2018)
Presented by Yale Parent RULER staff Kathryn Lee and Madeline Chafee
Emotions matter! Our emotions impact our attention, memory, learning, decision making, relationships, and physical and mental health.
Family life is the first place we learn to recognize, understand and manage our emotions. How can we, as parents, provide our children with the experiences that they will need to make sense of their feelings and the feelings of others? How can we demonstrate the importance of ‘choice’ when responding to our own feelings and the feelings of others?
Join us for an interactive workshop to learn about how our school is working to create a positive emotional climate for learning and developing the social and emotional skills of our school leaders, teachers and students. Family members will learn about the science of emotional intelligence and how we are applying the skills of emotional intelligence in our school with RULER. You’ll learn how to use emotional intelligence to help build trusting relationships at home while developing skills that will serve your child for a lifetime.

Child Protection &Orphan Care
All children have the right to be protected. They have the right to survive, to be safe, to belong, to be heard, to receive adequate care and to grow up in a protective environment. But unfortunately, millions of children are not fully protected. Many of them deal in their everyday life with violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, exclusion and/or discrimination. They are included among those that are classified as disadvantaged and poor. Such violations limit their chances of surviving, growing, developing and pursuing their dreams. Same is the case in emergency situation which often leads to the separation of children from their families and caregivers and are dangerously prone to violence, economic and sexual exploitation, abuse and potential trafficking. The actual number of children experiencing violations is not easy to determine.
“To support the target children for basics needs in terms of educational supports, health care, carrier counseling and livelihood support”
HIN feels that the poorer amongst poor in all segments of the society are the orphan. To care about is our humanitarian as well as religious prime duty. Thus HIN’s Orphan Support Program is a comprehensive approach towards caring such children in the society since 2003. In the adopted methodology, instead of supporting or sending them in orphanages, they are kept in their own dwelling and empowered through education, health and financial support while they remain in custodianship of their mothers or other close kith and kin.
Achievements
15, 392 Orphans Students supported about (Books, Stationary, Uniform and school fee)
15, 392 Orphans assisted to fulfill their nutritional needs
300 Orphans Children oriented on Leadership, Personality Development and Competitions

French Invasion of Florida Foiled by Authorities
May 4, 2006
Sirens wailed as agents from the Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and the FBI converged on an airport in Key West on Wednesday, ready to repel invaders.
The French had returned. Specifically, two French people, Alexis Peltier and Yves Stindel, who have been flying around the world in a homemade ultralight plane, because . . . well, I don’t know. Peltier is the founder of an environmental group called "Wings for Earth," but this did not appear to be part of anything connected with the group. They’re just flying around. That’s actually what they told the FBI: "We were just flying from Chile to Africa. It’s a long story," said Peltier, before agents "whisked him away for questioning."
Remember the guy who was rowing across the Atlantic Ocean, and then got into trouble two hundred miles short of the other side and called his mommy for help on his cell phone? He was French, too.
A Customs spokeswoman stated that "there was never any threat and there was no attempt to avoid detection," which I guess is why Border Patrol, Customs and FBI all converged on the airport, sirens wailing. The report speculated that "U.S. authorities tend to react quickly to unidentified aircraft coming from Cuba."

A wrong turning that led British Leyland to a dead end
Posted on 2018-02-15 by Ramsden	
We reprint an article that was first published ten years ago and illustrates the risks of using a mix of metric and Imperial measures.
In a recent comment, Charlie P asks:
“…. Which areas of UK business, commerce, education, engineering, manufacturing, science or technology do you think do not currently use metric as their primary system of measurement and would struggle in dealings with China?”
Very few, if any. But that is not the point. The successful metric changeover in much of the UK economy put the PM in a strong position on her sales trip to China in January, but the reluctance of successive British Governments over the past forty years to complete the process has left wasteful muddle and confusion at home: metric in sport but Imperial on road traffic signs, metric in the supermarket but Imperial for body weight and height, metric in construction but Imperial at estate agents, and so on and on.
We reprint below an article that first appeared in UKMA News in May 2007. It illustrates the risks involved in using a hybrid system of measures, and is by Michael Knowles BSc. It has not been edited and is longer and rather more technical than is normal for this site. Views expressed are those of the author.
“THE LEYLAND NATIONAL METRIC BUS
Saturday 28th April 2007 was the final day of service of the last substantial UK fleet of Leyland National buses, based near Walsall in the West Midlands. This vehicle is an important milestone in the history of the UK motor and engineering industry, when it tried to produce a metric bus.
The Leyland National bus is a contemporary of the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic airliner, and of greater economic significance. The prototype first ran in 1969 and the production vehicle appeared at the London Commercial Motor Show in September 1970. The buses were produced in a new, purpose-built factory at Lillyhall in the Lake District of northwest England. It sourced diesel engines, gearboxes and axles manufactured in various factories of the Truck and Bus Division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd, as well as wheels, air-brake equipment, power steering-rack units and other parts made by the UK component supply industry. The steel construction and safety cage made it one of the safest vehicles on the market, compared with conventional British buses having a steel chassis, and coachwork of sheet aluminium and plastic.
Low-profile 11.00 x 22.5 tubeless tyres were another important innovation, fitted on welded well- based rims: the first application of such tyres on a commercial vehicle in Western Europe. The design effort invested in the bus made it the safest and most expensive ever built in the United Kingdom. The original design was offered in two lengths of 10.3 and 11.3 metres to suit a wide range of operating conditions from small towns and villages with tight corners to large cities, in which roads were wider, and maximum passenger capacity was the predominating requirement.
A comprehensive research programme into the regulations of the world’s hard-road markets led to a vehicle of high international potential. It was especially intended for volume sales in the European Common Market, of which membership was confidently expected by both sides of government. After the 1970 election, Edward Heath’s team started to negotiate the Entry Terms with the Six from 23rd June. They were agreed in outline one year later on 23rd June 1971, when customs tariffs on cross-Channel trade in commercial vehicles were at the relatively high level of 22 per cent. Membership of the EEC would reduce this in fifths to zero on 1st July 1977.
The design team of the Leyland National had two particularly interesting challenges before them in the period 1965-70 covering its design and that of the Leyland 500 series engine which was to propel it. The first was to specify the entire vehicle with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) metric threads, as used on the engine. The marketing reason for this was so that the vehicle could be maintained with metric spanners. For general engineering purposes, there are only three systems of screw threads in the world, namely Whitworth, Unified and Metric. The first two are defined in inches and the third in millimetres. The policy of specifying ISO Metric to replace the other two was recommended at a conference held by the British Standards Institution in November 1965, and the Leyland National Bus was the pioneer vehicle on which it was first attempted in Britain.
The other challenge was to design a driveline for the short rear overhang of the 10.3 metre bus, which also applied to the longer version, as the same power-pack was common to both. This was a major headache for Leyland. Their solution was on view in the maintenance depot of Chase Bus Services. Leyland produced a special single-reduction spiral-bevel driving axle with a pair of helical gears in a casing on its nose. This raised the level of the input, so that it could be driven from the rear and to one side through a slotted tunnel in a special hot-pressed steel axle housing.
The vehicles running the all-day service from Walsall (on 28 April 2007) bore registration numbers of 1978 and 1979. They were 10.3 metre versions with Leyland 510 turbocharged engines. Both were fully loaded, with standee passengers, to about 16 tonnes gross weight. The 8-litre engines had a soft tick over and smooth take-up through their oil-charged fluid couplings; their electro-hydraulic gear change was faultless when timed correctly by the experienced drivers; the rack-and-pinion power steering was car-like and precise; the body-shell was rigid and the air suspension good.
A number of long, uphill gradients on the commemorative round-trip showed that the road performance was adequate, even with a full load of passengers. The bus industry average of sixteen passengers per ton (1016 kg) was probably exceeded. The range of engine revolutions available for acceleration and hill climbing seemed wide compared with classical slower-revving bus engines. It is a credit to the maintenance staff that the 510 engines were in such good condition, as production of this unit was discontinued at the close of the ‘seventies.
Since the bus was designed forty years ago, it is remarkable that its appearance is so clean and timeless that it could still to be in production today. However, its assembly factory and supply chain have all perished, after the stagnation and decline which blighted industry after 1975, as demand for UK engineering goods tailed off and collapsed through the nineteen-eighties. The Leyland Society, created after the centenary of the original company in 1996, has published in its excellent quarterly magazine Leyland Torque that there was a great sale of machine tools from the works in that period. It is a paradox that the Leyland Group factories, which pioneered metrication in 1965-70, joined the others that stagnated and stalled, because it was not completed.
The Leyland Society has also published an article on the Leyland 500 engine, but its most important feature and the basic clue to the demise of the motor industry was omitted. The Leyland 500 engine was the first product of the British motor and engineering industry to be specified with ISO metric threads, which were introduced into the UK as BS3643 in 1963. They were being issued by ISO when Britain’s first motorway, the Preston Bypass section of the M6 London-Carlisle route, was opened by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 5th December 1958.
Motorways and the motor vehicle are intimately associated. Germany was the origin of both the former, and of the metric standards used in European industry. At that time, there were thousands of British Army personnel in workshops maintaining the vehicles of the BAOR. It was common knowledge that, for the free circulation of British motor vehicles and equipment after the war, most UK production would eventually have to be aligned with continental practice. This meant that all UK motor vehicles and machinery would have to be specified for maintenance with metric spanners, and have metric ancillaries like ball and roller bearings, oil seals and fasteners.
The decision by UK government and industry on when and how to do this was delayed until Harold Wilson’s government of October 1964 acted in response to a Parliamentary Question by the MP for Oldbury and Halesowen, not far from Walsall. On 24th May 1965 a Parliamentary Written Answer was published in Hansard, stating that, “British industries would adopt metric units (and standards) within ten years” ending on 31st December 1975. The Wilson industrial metrication programme was the basis on which Edward Heath’s team negotiated the UK Entry Terms to the European Common Market, which allowed industry a buffer period to convert by the end of 1975. In 1976, the author took the export chair at Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd Diesel Division in Shrewsbury, when it was about to launch its CV range of metricated military engines.
The evidence from that forbidden period of British history has been exhibited and discussed at the Bath Royal Literary & Scientific Institution in academic and political freedom, beginning with a commemoration on 3rd-4th October 1998 of the 1898 Congress of Zurich. The Congress was hosted by the VSM (Association of Swiss Machinery Manufacturers) at the ETH (Federal Technical University) in Zurich. The purpose was to agree a common standard for screws, nuts and threaded components throughout the railway industry on the continent of Europe, to end the confusion of a multiplicity of screw threads pervading the railway network, especially since the expansion of international trains such as the Orient Express, and long-distance rail-freight traffic.
Whereas locomotives operated only within their home countries, the rolling stock made long journeys, say from Paris to Istanbul or Copenhagen to the toe of Italy. Maintenance or repairs undertaken away from base would be done using the threaded items and screwing tackle of the workshop involved. Original holes were drilled out and new threads cut, so that even a single vehicle might have several thread standards. It was an increasingly problematic situation, which had reached crisis point. The Congress concluded with consensus to adopt the S.I. (Système International) metric screw threads among all participating nations, which included Austro-Hungary and Russia. The S.I. metric threads were updated in 1958 with the Unified profile, and issued to all signatories to ISO, the official languages of which were/are English, French and Russian.
Metrication is only relevant to inch-based industry. The primary practical reasons for it were to make a British motor vehicle or machine maintainable in a metric workshop, and to facilitate the combination of a British engine with a metric gearbox or vice-versa. The ultimate academic analysis of the Leyland 500 engine is that it should have been designed and manufactured fully to ISO metric standards, just as a Mercedes-Benz, MAN, Renault or FIAT engine of the same era. However, from the start, this ideal aim was compromised and the unit became a mixture of inch and metric standards. It had superficially metric bore and stroke of 118 x 125 mm, although the latter was produced on an inch lathe at Leyland’s machine shops, which are now a supermarket.
The basic engine was machined to metric standards, but this only applied to the main castings and ISO metric threads issued in Britain as BS3643. Alas, the supplier industry could not offer a metricated fuel-injection pump; the large alternator was an American Leece-Neville device made under licence in Leyland at British United Traction, a division of Leyland Motors. The fluid coupling was inch, the planetary gearbox consisted of a long-established drum of rotating parts and gears in a new, rationalised casing, which should have been produced with ISO metric threads but instead, was made with Unified (inch). There were numerous inch pipes and unions for lubricating oil and compressed air. The rear axle and differential were designed with ISO Metric Coarse threads and Unified Fine or British Standard Fine (BSF). French and German citizens have difficulty in speaking expressions like 9/16” A/F in their own languages.
The gearbox is an ideal example of a product covered in British Standards Institution (BSI) Policy Document No. 6424:1968, published under the stewardship of Mr A W Benn as Minister of Technology. Section 3.6.4 is headed Partial Metric Design and states that a product can be designed with interior dimensions in imperial terms, but incorporate metric hardware items such as fasteners, oil seals, etc. This was found impracticable, since it is impossible to fit a metric oil seal to an imperial shaft. For a 3” (76.2 mm) outside diameter ground shaft, there was only a choice of 75 or 78 mm seals in the standard range derived from the German standard DIN 3. The BSI never translated DIN 3 into English, and this standard was not included in BSI Handbook No. 18 Metric standards for engineering first published in 1966, nor in the expanded second edition published in 1972 on the eve of Accession.
Finally the axles were another mixture of standards. The wheel fixing studs and nuts were 7/8” BSF, the wheel bearings were inch sizes manufactured by the British Timken Company at Duston, Northampton. The fasteners were ISO Metric coarse with Unified Fine or BSF, because Metric Fine threads were not available in the UK in time, so the vehicle was a technical hybrid, unattractive in any market. The first five years of its production were aimed at the domestic market, where it was allegedly difficult to maintain, but UK operators managed it somehow and production rose to a reasonable level. A good 1975 example belonging to Yorkshire Traction was examined with Leeds Metropolitan University in 2001, with a view to dismantling it and performing an inventory and analysis of the mechanical parts, but UK state funding was refused.
From launch to 1975, the Leyland divisional management should have ordered the redesign of the running gear to metric standards, so that a fully or at least competently metricated version would be available for the 1976 model year. From 1st January, the import tariff on cross-Channel trade was reduced to 4.4 per cent, so a left-hand drive 11.3-metre demonstrator was sent to Paris for evaluation by the Paris Transport Authority, along with a number of other contenders. It is more than likely that the French engineers investigated the screw threads on this vehicle, since they had specified the Wilson gearbox for their standard single-deckers in 1960, and thousands of licence-built metric versions were in service. They probably measured the wheel stud size and pitch and drew a half-shaft, to find that the fixing studs were ½” BSF – and not a metric standard.
The explanation of this lies in an instruction found in the Leyland Engineering Manual No. 211, left with the University of Bath for safe keeping about five years ago. The instruction advised draughtsmen not to design a new part if an existing part already existed. The hubs and half-shafts of the Leyland National Bus were originally from the Truck Cargo 10-ton 6 x 4 Leyland Hippo of 1946. The flanges of the forging were turned to match the hub diameter and bored with clearance holes for eight ½” BSF studs, which bottomed in eight female threaded holes tapped in the hub body. This minimised the inventory, and ensured interchangeability of parts between Leyland vehicles. However, the correct solution for the metricated Leyland National Bus was to bore the same shaft flange with clearance holes for ten M.14 setscrews. The SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) inch splines on the inner end would remain, but intentionally workshop staff would have found the Leyland National Bus half-shaft non-interchangeable with other models. They would have recognised the part through the ten fixing holes, saying “That’s a metric one for a National Bus” and everyone would have known about it.
Unfortunately the rectifications were not done, so the original monkey-puzzle on wheels was sent to Paris. Then the city of St Etienne ordered ten LHD Leyland Nationals, with 150 kW (200 bhp) engines. They were soon joined by ten more, and Leyland set up a local company to care for them, called Leyland Industriel S.A. The fleet was expanded to 27 vehicles through acquisition of the Paris demonstrator and six vehicles from Dijon wrongly described in a report in Commercial Motor as Leyland Nationals. They were assembled in Belgium by Brossel Frères, as the tariff was still too high to make direct imports of built-up Leyland Nationals economic. It was only possible for St Etienne to maintain these vehicles, because it was the only city in France that retained its tramway after the war. Their American Brill streetcars were built to pre-war US standards, with American National threads, so the older employees could relate to the post-war Unified threads on the Leyland National Buses. When they retired, the younger workshop staff had neither the knowledge nor the patience required, and the Leylands were sold off early to a remote island in the Indian Ocean. Buying British was an expensive mistake for St Etienne, which cost Leyland its market share, killed sales in the Common Market, and closed Lillyhall.” ©.

10 Responses to A wrong turning that led British Leyland to a dead end

This is the exact situation in the US. Many small companies not large enough to create demand have to produce mixed standard products, a hybrid between metric and USC. All modern, hi-tech componentry is imported and is metric. Even if 80 % of the components are metric, the American company will go out of their way to complete the assembly with USC parts and fasteners. Thus a hybrid.
In some cases, metric componentry is entered into the company data base with a USC description such that to the company staff it is a USC part. 50 mm x 3 mm copper bus bar for electrical connections is commonly referred to a 2 inch x 1/8 inch, even though it is not that size. Whereas 50 x 3 easily relates to 150 mm^2 wire size and comparable to a 150 mm^2 IEC wire standard, inch call outs don't relate to US wire gauge sizes.
American products are cursed with the higher costs of fitting rounded metric products with rounded inch products and the constant rework needed on the factory floor to fit parts together and difficulty of parts staying in tolerance. Fasteners is another issue. Except for some major industries, most small American companies unless they are required to by contract with a customer will always spec out USC fasteners, even if it is assembling together two components held together with ISO fasteners. Service is a nightmare as a dual set of wrenches/spanners is required.
It is no wonder that American technology is lagging in comparison to Europe and Asia. China which was once behind is catching up and is surpassing the US. No amount of flag waving and "Make America Great Again" rhetoric is going to reverse this. The Europeans and The Asians know this and in many ways may be supporting it as a means to prevent the US from ever being able to reverse their decline. The UK could be in the same position. Feed the opposition to metrication, support the movement back to imperial and keep the UK competitor out of the race.
The world economies may be drawing closer together and even uniting, but some players are obviously not wanted and the metric system can be an effective means to divide the wheat from the tares.

Now that Donald Trump is putting tariffs on imported steel, at what point will he put tariffs on metric made products entering the US, or even putting pressure on metric companies, like the auto industry to revert to USC?
Tariffs and restricted trade practices should be a topic of discussion as to their effects in either promoting the completion of metrication in the resistant countries or to encourage what little progress has been made to be reversed.

Interesting how in the US they will use the expression 'International' rather than say 'Imperial' or US Customary (USCS) measurement system.
Such a joke as only three countries in the world officially use Imperial or USCS measurements: Liberia, Myanmar and the United States.

@Jack,
Myanmar needs to be removed from that list of slackers. They have been effectively metricating since 2013. Liberia is also changing even if slowly. See the metric views article on Myanmar for more information.

But isn't Myanmar officially transitioning to metric?
That leaves Liberia (which sounds like it is in its own muddle) and the USA (still trying to restore the 18th century).

@Daniel Jackson:
Arghh, the dreaded Pacer railbus (British Rail class 140/ 141/ 142) is also based on these. Probably half imperial, half metric, even to this day—and also failed to sell abroad. Meanwhile, the class 143 & 144 of a similar vintage were based on another bus whose manufacturer, after a few changes of ownership, is still going strong! It is now exporting buses and educating its USA factory workers in metric to bring them up to speed—a very Scottish way of doing things…
p.s. Some earlier UK motor cars had metric threaded bolts with imperial flats throughout. But that was so you only needed one set of tools !

@Mark Williams
A few years a go I purchased a small table that required assembly. It came from China, but was actually an American product. The Americans must have insisted it be made with USC screws. The threads were USC, but the heads were metric. They even supplied cheap one-time use tools to complete the assembly.
From time to time, in the US if you buy a Chinese product or even fasteners that are USC thread, the heads will be metric. This is because the Chinese may make inch tools for the US market, but they don't use them themselves, so as to keep it simple and not need a dual set of tools.
Most of the time it isn't noticed that the inch bolts have metric heads. Most Americans will assume a bolt is inch and pick the closest inch tool to fit, even if it isn't 100 % snug. If it turns they are happy. This is good enough reason to abolish inch tooling and if there is a need to continue using inch threads, then put metric heads on them so that only a metric set of tools are needed. But this won't happen as there is big business in selling Americans twice as many tools as they need. Even with most people in the US having a dual set, they still use the wrong tool.

That reminds me of the 'good old days' of early UK metrication some British cars, for a short while, had metric screw threads with inch heads so only one set of spanners were required. A nice mix and match situation bound to annoy both sides of the conversion debate.
I have come across this from time to time, sad that this still happens in the 21 st century.

If Trump keeps angering other countries and putting up walls for trade, China might just stop being so accommodating and provide just metric only products, including fasteners.

NQBP Launches New Pre-MSA with Drug Regimen Review
Posted on April 27, 2012 by Tracey Lazzopina	
NuQuest/Bridge Pointe (NQBP) and myMatrixx have teamed up to maximize MSA savings potential and minimize the risk of prolonged settlement negotiations!
This comprehensive solution identifies and optimizes opportunities to lower costs associated with both medical treatment and pharmacy utilization. The Pre-MSA with Drug Regimen Review (PMDR) combines a medical analysis and Drug Regimen Review to provide a unique and complete clinical evaluation of future injury-related drug and medical costs allowing you to control utilization and costs prior to CMS submission.
Since MSA guidelines, issued in June, 2009, indicated that CMS would independently price future prescription drug costs in Medicare Set-Asides (MSAs)— pharmacy utilization costs have increased significantly causing MSA settlement amounts to double or even triple— making it increasingly difficult to settle claims.
To minimize the risk of prolonged settlement negotiations and expedite case closures— while mitigating costs— NuQuest/Bridge Pointe has developed a unique approach which allows insurers to gain control of injury-related drug utilization, medical treatment and other high costs associated with a MSA— early in the process.
NuQuest/Bridge Pointe’s PMDR has realized a proven average savings of 72%— comprised of 84% savings in prescription drugs and 16% savings in medical treatment.

Kendall Jenner files suit
February 11, 2016 CelebrityCompany: Cutera, Company: Kendall Jenner Inc, Entertainment/Culture, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kendall Jenner, Luxury brandssmbale
The model is suing a skincare company for $10 million (USD) over an advertisement. Alicia Powell reports.
Kendall Jenner, a model and one of the stars of reality TV show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” is suing a skincare company for at least $10 million (USD), claiming it used her photo in an advertisement without permission.
In the complaint, lawyers for Jenner say she never authorized Cutera Inc to use her likeness in an ad for its Laser Genesis treatment.
The ad quoted the 20-year-old as having once said acne had “completely ruined” her self-esteem, and claimed her now “nearly flawless skin” was the product of visits to a dermatologist for Laser Genesis treatment.
Legal documents say “Ms. Jenner’s actual endorsement for a worldwide campaign such as this would command a fee well into eight figures… Setting aside the monetary value,” it added, “it is Ms. Jenner’s choice whether or not to commercially endorse another party’s goods and services.”
Cutera did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit, filed by Jenner and her company Kendall Jenner Inc, accuses the company of trademark infringement, false endorsement, and violating Jenner’s right of publicity.

LCV: Trump, Pruitt Gut Toxic Air Pollution Standards, Let Industry Run Free
Alyssa Roberts, 202-454-4573, aroberts@lcv.org
January 25, 2018 Press Releases
Washington, D.C. – In response to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt today dramatically weakening safeguards against hazardous industrial air pollution, the League of Conservation Voters released the following statement from Vice President for Government Affairs Sara Chieffo:
“Scott Pruitt and Donald Trump are gutting public health protections by implementing a fundamental rewrite of the Clean Air Act with the stroke of a pen. This breathtakingly dangerous move will cause a huge rise in hazardous pollutants like lead, mercury, and arsenic, endangering the lives of children, the elderly, and communities of color who already bear the brunt of pollution.
“Any attempt to spin this as anything other than a complete sellout of our most basic public health protections is disingenuous at best and potentially deadly for vulnerable communities at worst. Even for Trump and Pruitt who have put polluter profits ahead of people at every turn, this is a catastrophic move and one of the worst betrayals of the EPA’s public health mission ever.”

National Discussions on Funding for School Nurses and School-Based Health Centers Address Free Care
April 17, 2012
|News
|By Paradigm Healthcare Services
As various groups aligned with school-based health work to secure and identify new sources of funding for essential services, finding a solution to restrictions caused by the federal free care interpretation continues to be discussed as an opportunity for providing schools with additional federal support.
Regardless of their insurance status, children in both regular and special education programs receive school health services in public schools. Although Medicaid reimburses schools for all covered health services that are provided according to a Medicaid-eligible student’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP), the free care interpretation prohibits reimbursement for medically necessary covered health services that are provided to regular education students with Medicaid coverage if a school provides those same services at no charge to other students.
In 2002 and 2004, the free care practice was successfully challenged by the state of Oklahoma. However, the practice continues to be enforced nationally by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). It is currently being challenged by the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) in California.
Today, as health care reform reframes the discussion around promoting cost-effective and efficient health care delivery to specific populations, stakeholders from all sides are working to find solutions to the free care interpretation that would allow schools to access federal reimbursement for the covered services being provided to regular education students with Medicaid coverage.
Free Care Highlight: Healthy Schools Campaign (HSC) School Nursing Convention, February 2012
Healthy Schools Campaign, an independent nonprofit focused on securing healthy school environments for children nationwide, partnered with Trust for America’s Health to hold a convention in Washington, DC, last February to promote discussion of the obstacles and opportunities for change associated with state and federal funding for school nurses. Attendees included representatives from the U.S. Department of Education and Health and Human Services, the National Association of School Nurses, the National Association of Medicaid Directors, and select state and Local Educational Agency (LEA) representatives as well as school-based Medicaid reimbursement program experts, including Paradigm, which was honored to participate.
A report of the proceedings and national policy recommendations, including a proposal to exempt schools from the free care interpretation, will be presented by Healthy Schools Campaign at a ceremony on May 9 in Washington, DC, to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius.

Free Care Highlight: California School Health Centers Association’s Annual Conference, March 2012
The California School Health Centers Association held its annual conference in Sacramento this past March, bringing together school-based health center (SBHC) providers, staff, and advocates from throughout the state. The two-day event provided dedicated time for members and attendees to discuss a range of topics, including the essential elements of funding and sustainability. Although the LEA Billing Option program is only one of several programs that SBHCs use to bill eligible services, it remains a limited contributor primarily because of the free care practice. The health community’s interest in finding a resolution for problems posed by this limitation was voiced in various workgroup and lunch seminar discussions.

Quote: Margot Kidder, 'Superman' actress, dead at 69.
'Margot Kidder, who found fame as Lois Lane in the 1978 film "Superman," died Sunday at her home in Montana,
her manager confirmed to CNN. She was 69 years old.
According to her manager, the actress died peacefully in her sleep.
Kidder starred opposite Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent and his alter ego Superman in the original film as well as
the three sequels: "Superman II" in 1980, "Superman III" in 1983 and "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace" in 1987.
Reeve died in 2004 of complications from an infection, nine years after becoming a quadriplegic following a horse
riding accident.
In 2016, Kidder told entertainment website Hey U Guys that her chemistry with Reeve was authentic "because we
came from similar backgrounds and he looked like one of my brothers." "So the energy we had was one of brother
and sister, which was often bickering, that took the place of romantic energy," she said.
"No one noticed the difference one from the other -- it worked. We didn't have to create a different reality."
Born in the Northwest Territories of Canada, she made her professional acting debut on the TV series "Wojeck" in
1969 and had her first film role in the 1968 Canadian movie "The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar."
Hollywood soon beckoned and a move to Los Angeles led to roles on TV shows including "McQueen," "Mod Squad"
and "Nichols."
But playing scrappy reporter and Superman's love interest Lois Lane was her breakout role.
Kidder told Hey U Guys she thought the film would be a flop.
"Nothing prepares anyone for that sudden thing of being world famous, it was such a shock," she said.
"It wasn't something I really liked or something I was very good at. I didn't realize how good the movie was until I seen
it at the premier in Washington."
She also starred in "The Amityville Horror" in 1979 and worked steadily in television and on stage.
After three marriages and thousands of dollars in medical bills, Kidder found herself homeless in 1996 as she struggled
with bipolar disorder. Her story grabbed the hearts of fans and Hollywood with many reaching out to help Kidder, who
eventually got back on her feet and went on to become a mental health advocate.
Tributes to the actress poured in on social media Monday...'

Awww no.
She was a lovely and talented actress.
Her portrayal of Lois Lane was very natural and believable IMHO.
Safe Journey Margot. I miss you already.

Post Email Ronda Rousey is stealing the hearts of both women and men across the world with every punch, kick and knee she throws. Men may have their chance to understand Rousey’s type of guy thanks to a recent Esquire interview with the undefeated UFC Women’s Bantamweight Champion. First, it is important to preface with the year-old’s comments to Access Hollywood back in May while publicizing Entourage: I want to be a girl when I come home. I want to be taken care of when I get home. This week, Rousey gave more specific instructions for men interested in her and similar women in stature. The bombshell gave tips to men interested in approaching tough women in the Esquire interview: Like, ‘Aw, you tried! She does not fall for the same tricks men give her and she does not suggest men give tough women the same generic lines. It takes some skill to be unique.

As for his education, he attended Fairfax High School in his birthplace, from where he is believed to have matriculated in ; it is unknown whether he went on to college. His Rise to Fame At some point in the previous decade, Charlie began spreading false information about himself on the internet, specifically several message boards on which boxing aficionados like to spend their time.
At the time, virtually no one knew whether Charlie was actually a good boxer, but he was still a frequent subject among the audiences of the sites on which he posted. In his first and only professional match on the 5th of March , he fought in the welterweight category against Andrew Heartley, and was disqualified after losing six consecutive rounds. Having a big fan base helps dealing with all the fame.
Since he speaks of these encounters as actual matches and counts them all towards his score, many of those that found out about Charlie have come to believe that he is mentally ill, although for now this is just an allegation. The first third of the video shows Charlie bullying his unsuspecting opponents, after which a year-old African-American male can be seen in the ring with him.

The JDN was formed in Vancouver in October to create a platform for junior doctors worldwide to ensure their voice is heard both within the World Medical Association and globally. As this is our first major event, we wanted to create an impact for the junior doctors and we chose the theme of Leading the way towards mutual respect — The role of Junior Doctors in preventing workplace bullying. We have seen a rise in the number of bullying and harassment cases involving doctors in recent times, whether they are amongst doctors or between doctors and their clients or relatives.
What is more alarming is the fate of doctors having to be on their feet for long hours saving lives and at the same time facing multiple stressors which in turn leads to poorer work performance, reduced work life balance and in the worst case scenario resulting neglect in patient care. We, the JDN Malaysian Chapter believe in creating a healthy working environment and strongly oppose any bullying or harassment at the workplace.
The team have put in a lot of effort from day one and it may take time before we see the results of the fight against bullying or harassment. However, we hope that with this JDN Penang Declaration , we are able to create awareness and put a stop to this unpleasant culture.

With Summer about to leave us…winter is coming! And with that comes just about too much action to keep track of. C Tyron Woodley vs Darren Till — UFC , Sep 8 It was likely that we would end up seeing this matchup at some point in the future but no one expected that we would be seeing it next. The biggest concern heading into the fight is that the undefeated , year old Darren Till has had some weight issues in the past. Being one of the most underrated fighters in MMA when it comes to their high fight IQ, Woodley has an interesting challenge ahead of him.
Especially when looking back at his two bouts with Wonderboy. Till is somewhat of a more aggressive version of the Karate striker as he showed us in his last time out. And seeing how Thompson approached Woodley in both fights, which was with less aggression than we can expect from Till, it makes this matchup quite compelling.
This creates a very interesting dynamic with the more aggressive tactical kickboxing style that Till possesses. MMAFighting Not once, not twice but three times!

US midterm elections: Is gridlock good?
Quickview: The US midterms have, as expected, seen the Democrats take the House with the Republicans holding the Senate. Our investment experts consider the implications for fiscal policy, trade, and the 2020 presidential election.
07.11.2018
Further tax cuts unlikely but will Trump strike a deal on trade?
Keith Wade, Chief Economist, says:
“The midterm elections restored some faith in opinion polls with the Democrats taking the House of Representatives and the Republicans holding the Senate. Conventional wisdom has it that a gridlocked Congress is good for markets as it prevents politicians from interfering in the economy. However, US markets have received a considerable boost from the president’s tax cuts and deregulation measures.
“Going forward, gridlock means less fiscal support for the economy as Democrats are unlikely to back further tax cuts. This could create a problem for US growth in 2020 when the existing package fades and is not replaced by further measures. It is possible that the president and the Democrats could strike a deal on infrastructure spending, but they may hesitate to take measures that could help get Trump re-elected as president.
“Faced with a potential block on fiscal policy, the president may turn to trade policy and look to strike a deal with China and so prevent a further damaging escalation in the trade war. From an economic perspective, that would be the logical step. However, Trump will have to weigh up whether the economic costs outweigh the political benefits of playing to his base support – many of whom see tariffs as an essential part of putting America first.”
Future policy will require bipartisan support
Frank Thormann, Portfolio Manager, Multi Regional Equity, says:
“Two important implications from this election will be stronger presidential oversight and increased political gridlock. Democrats now have a much larger ability to put a check on the president’s power and have promised to intensify investigations into allegations such as the Russian 2016 election interference.
“Because both houses are required to pass legislation, future policy will require much greater bipartisan support, which is a dramatic change from the past two years and is likely to materially alter the remainder of the Trump presidency. One immediate impact of this is a lower likelihood of further fiscal stimulus, which is slightly weighing on the US dollar this morning.”
Larger Republican Senate majority is significant
Frederick Schaefer, Head of Equities Management, US Small Cap Product Managers, says:
“In a rebuke rather than a rejection of the president, US voters have elected a divided Congress. The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives after eight years as the minority party.
“In the House, a number of Republican moderates lost or chose not to stand for re-election. This means the Republican House caucus will become more conservative and more Trump-like. The new House Democratic majority will be more challenging to the president on a number of issues. Consider the possibility of a House committee issuing a subpoena for him to release his tax returns.
“On the Republican side, the larger Senate majority is a significant accomplishment. Additionally, Republican gubernatorial candidates fared well, winning races in key states such as Ohio and Florida. As we approach the 2020 elections, these two states are significant prizes in presidential elections.
“In an interview on the eve of the election, Mr Trump conceded that maybe he should have toned down his rhetoric during his first two years. Perhaps this may presage a less bellicose president and less contentious Washington. But don’t count on it.”

Searching for Possibilities in the Southeast
June 13, 2017 Front Pagevictor

Summit of Possibilities – October 27, 2016, Downey.
The 710 Corridor, otherwise known as South East Los Angeles (SELA), is an area of Los Angeles County that represents an opportunity for regional cooperation that could positively impact the lives of its three-quarters of a million residents according to the findings the study, “The Central 710 Corridor: An Asset Based Analysis.”
It was presented at the October 2016 “Summit of Possibilities,” which brought together state and local elected officials from the SELA as well as community leaders to discuss how to use the data to better the lives of its residents.
Eight months have passed since the summit and the release of the report. The landscape remains the same and civic leaders are hopeful that the data will encourage local elected officials to work together to create policies that affect many issues facing the region including access to public transportation, economic development, housing density, environmental concerns among others.
CCF Public Policy VP Efrain Escobedo (left), with Dr. Juan Benitez on his left, posing with other Summit panelists including Speaker Anthony Redon (center).
“We believe that the region has a lot of assets and opportunities and so much of the focus and so much of whatever the data has been available has been from a deficit perspective and our intent with this study is to change the conversation and pivot the perspective,” said Efrain Escobedo, California Community Foundation’s vice president of Civic Engagement and Public Policy.
The report and summit were produced through a partnership between the California Community Foundation and the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs.
South Gate City Council Member Alphonso Rios agreed, “There are efforts to mitigate some of the history and change the narrative for those communities in the region.”
Dr. Juan Benitez, executive director of the Center for Community Engagement at California State University-Long Beach said it will take work and cooperation from local leaders.
“The expectation can’t be that elected officials inherently will be working together. There needs to be some effort placed in that as well, because you have different coverage geographically and politically for the area being represented.”
The study area covers 11 different cities and four unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. It is also represented by five different state assembly members.
According to Benitez, there are three pillars to the research that will lead to effective change.
First there must be community engagement with key stakeholders.
Second, local leaders must participate in capacity building to understand how the data can influence policy and the implications of those policies as well as engage constituents and stakeholders.
The third pillar is the data itself.
South Gate City Mgr. Mike Flad – a Policy Center panelist in 2015.
“Good governance requires data driven decisions, reports like this provide the data that municipal government needs to make quality decisions,” said South Gate City Manager Mike Flad.
“Data’s great, but the data has to be implemented, so what this provides is a tool and a data set that councils and local administrators can use to make policies.”
The data is already helping some of the smaller cities, according to Lynwood City Manager Alma Martinez, “The benefits of assessments like this are innumerable. Cities like Lynwood do not have the financial capacity to undertake such an exhaustive regional study due to limited financing and staff.”
“Some of the data included is utilized by the City,” said Bell Mayor Fidencio Gallardo. “It is utilized as part of our General Plan update.” He added that the data from this report is included in a market study for economic development purposes and added that Bell conducts its own studies.
Martinez pointed out the most important message in the report, “Lynwood can utilize the data presented at the Summit of Possibilities to build coalitions amongst the cities in the region to address issues like education, employment and transportation. At the regional level we can work to develop overarching goals and delineate objectives that can then be fostered into implementation.” She added that Lynwood can’t address these issues alone, but must work with the other municipalities to create regional objectives and strategies that improve the community.
Raquel Beltran addresses a SoCa Latino Policy Center forum.
“There is a SELA civic engagement collaborative that will be doing a lot of work around the summit,” said Raquel Beltran, associate director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs. “With emphasis on creating a platform for non-profits and residents to understand more about the research, it’s an effort to allow that research to be used to help shape data driven policy positions that they may want to pursue in their local community.”
Added Benitez, “Where there is a will, I think that is a huge opportunity and we do have electeds that take those things into consideration. I just think that we just don’t have a regional policy agenda and/or systematic ways to uphold those three pillars.”
Beltran is more optimistic, “There’s energy for it, there’s positive energy. If there’s anything that could be helpful, it is to demonstrate that there is positive energy and that’s significant.”

All Hail Starbrillian, King of Porn
Any taxing pornoholic has to be at least heard of the tube placing known as xHamster.com. Most of you, I’m well-disposed to wager, incorporate fapped to it on more than statement occasion. Representing some of you, it power honourable be your go-to porn tube site. And, if that is the argle-bargle , you are certainly not alone. In phenomenon , there are 10 million others who fap to xHamster swiftly a in timely fashion contribute to be registered users. After Xvideos and Porn Whirl , it is the third most heighten obnoxious placing on the internet today. Headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus, xHamster was founded in 2007 via Alex Hawkings. The minds behind the purlieus wanted to do something one of a kind from what they were seeing most porno sites doing at the time. Coming unpropitious of the eminence eminence of societal media sites like Facebook and Cackle , xHamsters founders count revealed to engender a alignment that was as parts porn tube and xxx collective media site. A spokesperson regardless of the ambience said of xHamster’s intentions that the purlieus was meant payment people who wanted to blether , dealing tantalizing pics and in garden-variety videos ... to espy complementary friends online and mayhap revealed partners interested in mucker relationships." I up it is fair to point out that x Hamster has done a bang-up business of providing the abstract that they situation sin to to , as it has be a cornucopia of non-professional and homemade user-uploaded content. As haggard as the “ sight partners interested in acquire relationships” confidential is chargeable , granted , I cannot hint to. I cover not in any felt the paucity to serve to a porn say to espy my “ sempiternal relationships,” but I am acutely nuts to discern if anyone’s all the had any of with that slant of the site. The People’s Porn Network Along with so much user-uploaded return , admitting that , diversity is secured to on sooner or later. With the numberless of people also clientage there in the community who are aberrant fucks—not disturbed fucks who excorticate all epoch fapping in their mothers’ basements the more you are a sick fuck, I’m talking licit , clinically stream sado-masochistic fucks—a emplacement like xHamster that allows its users to upload basically whatever they necessity was obligated to arise inundated with verboten and fucked up content. xHamster has not struggled in keeping up with the shifting collective tides and establishing a rationality of upstanding duty , though. In April of 2016, wholly encase , North Carolina enacted laws that said its counties and cities were allowed to flauntingly conversion against members of the LGBT community. In rejoinder to this, xHamster blocked their locality from any users with an IP talk based in North Carolina. You muscle also to hearing distance off the People V. Turner arousing surrender case. To act as strive the growing revolt of lay waste enlightenment in America, xHamster banned all videos involving snatching , including those which featured the fucking of unknowing partners. Their societal and federal involvements don’t stump there, though. distinct of my unusual favorite bureaucratic statements that they made came in rebut to the 2016 Self-governing Affair Assembly email departure , when they offered Debbie Wasserman Shultz $50,000 to crew in a porno incongruous a Bernie Sanders lookalike. You revoke , since she already fucked him into the of the election. Ah, if that isn’t fucking gold, I don’t with what is. The Site Itself Seemingly , xHamster has made unreservedly a chastity repayment themselves in their less excepting break of possibility as a xxx communal media/porn tube. But does the region itself prison up to all the hype? Graciously , detonate ’s gain a look. From the younger you publication at xHamster’s folks' wake up , it is flinty not to be impressed aside how decontaminated and uncomplicated to trek the spider's manifest is. With videos disobeyed into two unconstrained and unmistakable categories: flashy porn videos and newest porn videos. You can also without a cheesecloth unconnected with largest substitute of newest and on a (which is a admirable caprice , backsheesh homemade videos, post some percipience , a to be significantly shorter in stretch ). To your left-wing , you can purposes cheesecloth search results in front genus , moat , or porn luminary via unconditionally clicking on it. You can also component tags together with friendless click—a absurd peculiarity that, means , is glaringly missing from a juxtapose of tube sites that I’ve browsed. Their unwasteful studio joyous appears up alongside their teeming archive of homemade stamp , unless you calculate otherwise. You can also conveniently riddle the videos so that you essentially squeeze weigh down undeviating , gay, or shemale videos. If you don’t indicate at all in your hedonism, mode , you can at all times in all three. The most annoying lean that they added was a hardcoded watermark on record of the videos. It in this day dissection messes with your fap nibble , when you're make inaccessible to determine a tease jizz on a chick's phizog and then...BOOM! That abuse watermark "this video has been uploaded to xHamster" appears on the chick's be published like a motherfucking cockblocker! Forthrightly , whoever fee it was a usual notion deserves a shy away from in the balls! As distance off as xHamster’s sexually transmitted media components are vexed , you badger all the subside community-oriented features that you’d be reach-me-down to on other yet sites (such as Porn Kernel )—you can censure on/rate videos, up videos to your favorites, upload videos/pictures, and knock off users directly. Unbroken peninsula that extraordinarily sets xHamster but from the others, metrical , is that, when you click on their marker labeled “dating,” you are not brought to some ill-defined third-party scam “ flee laid tonight” If you’re looking in every a disturbing (and I be awarded pounce on overwhelmingly ) archive of porn videos, Video-One.com prejudice be the injurious than you. I’m talking less 54,000 pages (yes, I said “pages”) of videos, each manservant containing enclosing 360 videos. At math was at no my balmy not bad but I concoct that adds up to a inexhaustible unworldly of 20 million videos! Account the in that Video-one is adding furthermore contented every boyfriend consistent the loneliest, horniest fappers broaden us would underwater go to pieces ambience of substantive on this tube site. From the far you recoil from to video-one.com ( to predestined you don’t of the hyphen; Video-One is a video chatting shopper ), you are pretext in the impassable of all that the paroxysm has to offer. At the meridian of the tryst discern 50 or so suggested categories to be from (“ add to ” “ kicker knock over ” “caught pirating ,” and “ amateurish compilation” to account a some ). Lots of Virgin Hardcore Settle These tags all things considered furnish you a urbane fitting sketch of what to reckon on from Video One. Another talents to on an sight of the take of components they lodge is to harrow a look at what sites they cooperative to: xHamster, Beeg, TXXX, and DTVideo are a few. What this should promulgate you is that a of the fulfilled pleases be homemade, or at least amateur-inspired. You ingenuity imprint a gird of it Gonzo. I originate to goal the semester “raw.” We’re talking productions akin to Casting Tete-…-tete Forgery Hackney and Asian Import Meat. Granted, Video-One does endowed with the special HD studio video thrown in here and there, the womanhood of their dimension if not full-on homemade, is from unified of these studios that specializes in smart-alecky content. Be Particular What You Click On Video-One also seems to seemly to the demographic of pornophiles who goal the more taboo courteous things —daddy/daughter, brother/sister incest roleplay. Admirably at least I await it’s all roleplay. Some of the videos in these sections are from block recognized, upright studios, but a standard slice of them look to be determine homemade and are tagged with things like “ Real Sister.” I pick up no about with of verifying whether or not these videos are in forbidden or not. I determination as ain’t clicking on that shit. I misapplication that you bored incestuous fucks would baggage the fuck away from the conformist web. up with to the crude entanglement voyage noisome shit like that. Furthermore, I categorically mull tube sites like Video-One should in a curt calling in the sand against interdicted ingredients like this. unaltered if these aren’t authorize incest videos, why but in that they mightiness be? Anything tagged with something like “ Underlying Sister” should be when removed from your site. This humanitarian of shit, unfortunately, spoils what could been a horrific tube stretch proffer me. It should not be on the viewer’s to awareness prohibited or potentially derogatory content. That becomes your trusteeship the refer you arbitrate to heap up a porn site. How the fuck is this a rank that I can’t obvious skim crack a tube belittle without worrying seldom whether or not doing so aim a me be on some FBI programme that I not later than no phenomenon being on? Up with on, Video-One, net your fucking shit together. Having said that, be watchful what you click on if you belief to in this site. If you’re okay with sifting fetter potentially unsanctioned amuse there is a myriad of legit, all to elements here to enjoy. And, again, a fucking brobdingnagian amount of it. of to grangerize I was on the locality hope 10 minutes grant edibles the homepage. In that 10 minutes, 15 present-day videos had been uploaded. That’s crazy. You’ll at no seemly unconfined of videos to alight from on Video-One. A Labyrinth of Putrefaction The plat itself is designed genteel subject Either As immeasurably as ads are painful there are some, but most are thoughtfully kept to the worthless of pages. Which, facts in fact the mischief-maker of videos that fashion on each send , you’d in the offing to do a acheron of a lot of scrolling to things into uncover them. I do much that aspect. disposal , current you do to them, there are shit load. No ads in videos, though. You deliberation into the subordinate pop-up, matrix in ad when you click on a video, but at least it’s not every fucking consummation you click on something like it is on a allocation of other sites. I would unmistakeably be no , but if I comprise to search after them, then I variable these ads are equitably excusable. incredibly the seniority of the on-page ads are in the other tube sites (which is genuinely money-making if you aid to and the fuck away from the incest bullshit), and the advanced hold-up pop-ups were predominantly pages that were skilled to satiety in withdrawn mode. I’m not plain to the what this means, but if I can’t joke the ad, I’m happy. A marrow Supplied to Motivate At the You up with Wager to Fappin’ To be unfailing I am lock turned impecunious there the potentially illegitimate keynote to be on Video-One. It’s a abashment too, because Video-One has so much unrealized to be a anxious porn venture with a shit ton of brains to to from. Quieten down if they removed all of their potentially illicit videos, they would placid be undergoing a ginormous archive to explore. All of us porn addicts in to remote together and authorized stomp this well-meaning of shit manumitted of our community. Vexillum shit that looks sketchy. If you can.

Trump lashes out at ‘nasty’ fired aide Omarosa

US President Donald Trump yesterday said he kept former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman on staff because she praised him even as she failed to do her job, the latest insult in the two former reality television stars’ public battle.
Mr Trump said the former ‘The Apprentice’ contestant had begged for a job in the White House but was hated by others, missed work and was “nasty”.

Still, he said he directed his chief of staff, John Kelly, to try to smooth things over with her.
“When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser & nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me – until she got fired!” he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter.
Ahead of today’s release of her book ‘Unhinged’, which describes her time in the White House, Omarosa – known commonly by her first name – has released recordings of conversations she had with Mr Kelly and Mr Trump when she was fired in December.
The White House said the recordings raise questions about her integrity.
Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Sunday also said the recordings, including one in the White House’s secure Situation Room, showed “a blatant disregard for our national security”.
Asked if she was concerned about any legal consequences, Omarosa told NBC’s ‘Today’ programme: “No, absolutely not.”
She was previously best known for repeatedly being fired on NBC’s ‘The Apprentice’ and was one of Mr Trump’s more visible African-American supporters during his 2016 election campaign.
“It’s sad that with all the things that’s going on in the country that he would take time out to insult me and to insult my intelligence,” she told MSNBC in reaction to Mr Trump’s tweets.
“This is his pattern with African-Americans, and he doesn’t know how to control himself.”
The row comes as Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who came under fire by Republicans for sending text messages that disparaged Mr Trump during the presidential campaign, was dismissed from the bureau late on Friday, his attorney said yesterday.
Terminate
Mr Strzok is the third high-ranking person to be fired from the FBI during the Trump administration, including former director James Comey.
Aitan Goelman, Mr Strzok’s attorney, said in a statement that FBI deputy director David Bowdich made the decision to terminate his client.
The decision, Mr Goelman added, was at odds with a recommendation by the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility, which had called for Mr Strzok to face a 60-day suspension and demotion from his supervisory responsibilities.
“The decision to fire special agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical Bureau practice, but also contradicts director Wray’s testimony to Congress and his assurances that the FBI intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,” Mr Goelman said.
Mr Trump took to Twitter not long after the news broke. “Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI-finally,” he said. “The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & long.”
Mr Goelman said that his client’s firing was politically motivated and that his texts represented political speech protected by the First Amendment.
Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe after a scathing report by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog concluded he had leaked information to reporters and misled investigators about his actions.
Mr Comey was fired by Mr Trump in May 2017 after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein helped pen a memo that was critical of how Mr Comey handled the FBI’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.
Later, however, Mr Trump claimed he fired Mr Comey over that “Russia thing”, apparently referring to the FBI probe into whether his presidential campaign colluded with Russia. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.
Mr Strzok was deeply involved in the FBI’s Clinton email investigation and was temporarily assigned to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office. He was removed from that post after his texts came to light.
Republicans in Congress have repeatedly pointed to the texts as evidence the FBI is biased against Mr Trump.

Cohen to testify to Congress in February
AFP, Washingon
President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen will testify in Congress next month, lawmakers said Thursday, posing a potential new threat to the president as the Russia collusion investigation increasingly menaces the White House.
The newly Democrat-controlled House Oversight Committee said Thursday that Cohen will testify in a public session on February 7.
Bomb-laden rebel drone kills 6 at Yemen
AP, Sanaa
A bomb-laden drone launched by Yemen's Shiite rebels exploded over a military parade Thursday for the Saudi-led coalition, killing at least six people in a brazen attack threatening an uneasy U.N.-brokered peace in the Arab world's poorest nation.
The attack at the Al-Anad Air Base showed the unwillingness of Yemen's Houthi rebels to halt fighting in the civil war, even if it doesn't violate a peace deal reached last month in Sweden between them and Yemen's internationally recognized government.

AP, Quetta
Pakistan's military says security forces have raided militant hideouts in the country's southwest, triggering shootouts that left two of the insurgents dead.
In a statement, the military says troops also seized a cache of guns, grenades, rockets, land-mines, explosives and communications equipment in Friday's operations. It provided no further details, but militants and ethnic separatists who have been waging a low-level insurgency in the Baluchistan province often target security forces there.

Former Georgia Democratic Rep. Stacey Abrams announced that she does not plan to for president in 2020 during an interview at SXSW Monday but later backtracked on Twitter.
“In the spreadsheet with all the jobs I wanted to do, 2028 would be the earliest I would be ready to stand for president because I would have done the work I thought necessary to be effective in that job,” Abrams said in the interview, appearing to indicate she didn’t feel prepared enough for the office of president.
She quickly backtracked on Twitter shortly afterward, indicating that a primary run in “2020 is definitely on the table.”

“In #LeadFromTheOutside, I explore how to be intentional about plans, but flexible enough to adapt. 20 years ago, I never thought I’d be ready to run for POTUS before 2028,” Abrams tweeted. “But life comes at you fast – as I shared in Q&A w @Yamiche at @sxsw. Now 2020 is definitely on the table…”

— Stacey Abrams (@staceyabrams) March 11, 2019
Abrams’ Campaign manager during her 2018 run for governor in Georgia also provided backup on Twitter after the interview, revealing that Abrams was referring to an old career-based spreadsheet where she originally planned to run for the White House in 2028, but that her recent run and celebrity within the party changed her circumstances enough to bring that timeline up.
“Fact check: @staceyabrams‘ remarks at #SXSW were in reference to her years-old spreadsheet, not her current considerations. She is taking a look at all options on the table in 2020 and beyond,” Lauren Groh-Wargo said Monday afternoon. (RELATED: Stacey Abrams’ ‘Voter Suppression’ Attacks Legislation She Sponsored)

Abrams earlier indicated that she would announce a decision on her plans for the 2020 election cycle sometime in March or early April, and she didn’t announce a change in that timeline during the interview.
It’s also possible that she runs against Republican Sen. David Perdue in her home state of Georgia in 2020. She lost her 2018 gubernatorial bid by 1.4 percentage points, and she still has a sizeable campaign account that could translate into momentum in a Senate Race.
Abrams appeared to leave that door open later in the same interview.
“My task is to make certain that a Democrat is elected not only to the White House but that we have a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Democratic majority in Congress,” Abrams said.

While the cease-fire in Syria, drawn up by the US Secretary of State and his Russian counterpart, seemed to be holding – apart from the Israëli violations on the first day – the Pentagon attacked the Syrian Arab Army for the second time. Washington claimed it was a mistake, but the reaction of the US ambassador to the UNO, on the contrary, made it seem more like the execution of a plan. What game is Washington playing?
Even as it negotiated a cease-fire with the United States, Russia knew that they would not respect it any more than they had respected previous agreements. But Moscow was hoping to move ahead on the road to the recognition of a multipolar world. As for Washington, they played the card of the end of Obama’s Presidency to justify the implementation of a «last chance» agreement.
We shall leave to one side the Israëli attempt to profit from the truce to attack Damascus and the Golan. Tel-Aviv attracted a volley of new generation missiles, lost one plane and will have to repair a second. It seems that Syria now has the capacity to contest the Israëli domination of regional airspace.
We shall also leave to one side the European heads of state and governments, who applauded the agreement without knowing its content, and consequently covered themselves with ridicule.
We shall speak of facts – the UNO humanitarian convoy was stuffed with arms and ammunition. It is still waiting at the Turkish border, officially because the road is not safe, but unofficially because Syria is demanding that it be allowed to search the convoy before letting it pass. This UN trickery corresponds to the revelations of the ex-head of Turkish anti-terrorism, Ahmet Sait Yayla, who is currently in hiding – the Pentagon and Turkey use humanitarian convoys to arm the jihadists.
Then the Pentagon attacked a static Syrian position in Deir ez-Zor. It ceased its attack only when Russia alerted it to its «mistake». And then it allowed the jihadists to pursue their attacks on the road it had opened for them.
Strategically speaking, preventing the Syrian Arab Army from liberating all of the governorate of Deir ez-Zor means maintaining Daesh in its role as an obstacle on the road linking Damascus-Baghdad-Teheran. In the past, the Pentagon had allowed Daesh to settle in Palmyra, the historical stage on the «Silk Road». Today, this road is still cut by the jihadists on the Iraqi side, but could be by-passed via Deir ez-Zor if the Iraqis liberate Mossoul.
From the US point of view, the cease-fire agreement was simply a means of gaining time, supplying the jihadists and relaunching the war. Turning the situation around on the diplomatic front, Russia called for an emergency meeting of the Security Council, which caused panic in Washington. Indeed, this period not only coincides with the end of Obama’s mandate, but also with the General Assembly of the United Nations.
Manifestly nervous, the US ambassador to the Security Council, Samantha Power, left the Council room in the middle of the session in order to address a group of journalists. She was hoping that in this way, the first Press reports would relay only the US point of view. She therefore made ironic comments about the Russian «stunt» about what was, after all, just a simple live-fire «incident» (62 dead and a hundred wounded!) She then launched into a diatribe against the far more dastardly crimes committed by the Damascus régime. Warned about this manipulation, the Russian ambassador, Vitali Tchourkine, then left the Council room himself in order to share his point of view. Prudently, the journalists, who had just been alerted by the British House of Commons to the lies of Madame Power concerning the alleged crimes of Mouamar Kadhafi, wrote up both sides of the story.
As from now, Russia will intensify its diplomatic advantage – the United States have been caught red-handed in treachery. Moscow could therefore use the General Assembly to announce its desire to finish with the jihadists. The US manipulation will turn against those who imagined it. Washington will have only two options left – either engage in an open confrontation, which it does not want, or accept that its protégés lose the game.

Cheap Power Is Luring Battered Bitcoin Miners to Iran
While some bitcoin miners are estimated to have shut down hundreds of thousands of machines – if not more – others are still out there looking for alternative ways to keep operating.
And it’s Iran, with its extremely low-cost electricity (that can go as low as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour) that’s luring overseas miners. But as attractive as it appears, the journey to setting up shop in Iran isn’t turning out to be a simple one.
Bitcoin mining is, in effect, a kind of energy arbitrage. Miners make their money when the cost of producing coins – currently 12.5 bitcoins per transaction block, plus any fees they’ve accrued – is lower than the operation of the mine itself, including electricity.
Nima Dehqan, a blockchain researcher at a Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak, told CoinDesk that the firm has been meeting with foreign investors that are looking to attempt just that by mining in Iran.
“We have had investors visiting our farms from Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, France,” he said.
Dehqan added that his firm has signed a deal to become the local partner for a Spanish mining firm called Coinpods to set up mining farms in Iran, a process that will consist of three phases.
“First is sort of a just-to-make-sure testing phase, which is already in place. Second is building new infrastructures together, which somehow has already started, too. And the third will be gathering more investors from outside of Iran,” he explained.
Dehqan said investors are attracted the cheap electricity, which, depending on the actual source of power, can usually go well below $0.01 per kilowatt-hour. And his firm can run facilities at different scales, from two-to-three-megawatts small farms, to higher amounts like 10 – 20 megawatts.
He said while the electricity cost in Iran has always been relatively low, the recent significant devaluation of the Iranian rial – partially due to the recent sanctions by the U.S. government – has made the opportunities even more appealing.
Secret shift
There’s even evidence to suggest miners in countries commonly seen as bitcoin mining powerhouses – China in particular – are looking at Iran for potential opportunities.
Compared to the numbers cited by Dehqan, electricity provided by hydropower stations in China’s southwestern region usually costs around 0.15 yuan – or about $0.02 per kilowatt-hour – in the summer when water is abundant. When winter comes, the cost could go up to $0.04 per kilowatt-hour.
It appears that some Chinese miners have already made the move. A startup based in Chengdu, China, told CoinDesk under the condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal that it has already deployed 2,000 miners in Iran.
“Iran has vast natural gas resources and thus the electricity cost can be as low as 0.04 yuan [$0.006] per kilowatt-hour. But Iran doesn’t really have any firm making miners. Now that secondhand miners are being sold cheaply in China, it’s a rather reasonable business decision. With electricity that cheap, you can generate profits in one to two months,” the company said in a statement.
Javad Sedighi, a self-employed cryptocurrency miner in Iran, echoed that point, telling CoinDesk that local miners largely rely on the import of machines to the country.
“[That’s] because there are no companies, like Bitmain, [shipping equipment] to Iran. In the past few months, there have been intermediary companies [being] established in Iran that carry out the import of the machines,” Sedighi said, adding:
“I think this is done by people who have a lot of power and money. And it’s done secretly.”
That kind of potential – particularly for very cheap power – has even caught the attention of notable Chinese bitcoin millionaires like Chandler Hongcai Guo. On Oct. 26, Guo posted a video on his Weibo account, telling a group of audience that there’s a huge opportunity in Iran where electricity cost can go well below $0.01 kilowatt-hour.
“It’s suitable for hosting secondhand miners that are on the edge of shutting down in China and can make profits in one to two months,” he was recorded as saying, and asked interested miners to visit Iran to do their own due diligence.
No simple paths to entry
But in conversation with CoinDesk, Dehqan sought to temper the idea that miners are rushing into Iran en-masse since the methods by which foreign investors can set up mining facilities are anything but simple.
The Chinese miner that has set up 2,000 machines said one major hurdle for outsiders is to get miners inside the country to begin with, let alone establishing partnerships with local farms.
The company explained that, currently, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – a branch of the country’s military – still has significant sway on the border. Simply put, they have the power to decide which shipments come in and which ones do not.
“There’s the risk of miners being detained and confiscated at the border. While some logistic companies may have an insurance policy to cover the loss but you can only get compensated by fiat and miners will be gone,” the firm said, adding:
“It’s still very risky. Even though we also try to act as an agent to help other miners go overseas, many of them remain hesitant.”
Dehqan echoed that point and added it’s not so easy to import miners into Iran and some special shipping procedures are necessary.
Sanction complications
And it’s not just internal pressures like border security that are proving to be barriers to would-be investors. Indeed, there’s one particular figure – U.S. President Donald Trump – who has thrown some wrenches into the proverbial gears.
As it stands, current U.S. sanctions have further deterred potential investors that have ties to the world’s largest economy. Guo, who owns a mansion in California, told CoinDesk via WeChat that while he agrees the opportunity is very attractive now that the bitcoin mining difficulty and the overall network hash rate have both dropped significantly, investors like him would not dare to become involved.
“I didn’t go visit myself, considering that the U.S. has imposed the economic sanctions on Iran,” he said, alluding to recent news that the chief financial officer of Huawei was arrested in Canada for alleged involvement in sanctions fraud.
“Most of the mining giants in China, or miner makers, do not dare to host their machines in Iran. This is the general situation. As attractive as the electricity over there might be, only miners at an individual or much smaller scale are shifting to Iran. Most people are still hesitant.” Guo said.
On Aug. 6, the Trump administration announced it would re-impose sanctions on Iran starting from Aug. 7 after withdrawing from a nuclear agreement the U.S. government first entered in 2015. However, the European Union, Russia and China have been reportedly seeking to uphold the agreement to allow businesses and financial transactions to continue with Iran.
According to Sedighi, cryptocurrency mining in Iran itself is still a legal grey area, which means that it’s neither entirely legal or illegal.
“The rules of the mining industry in Iran have not been approved by Parliament. But it is in hand,” he said. “In Iran, like the rest of the industry, you do not have a license to operate. For example, you can not get a bank loan.”
To that effect, Sedighi said the local crypto community is working together to push Iranian lawmakers to pass a formal law that would protect the mining industry, thus enabling it to attract capital and grow.
“We believe that political disagreements between governments should not harm the people,” he said, concluding:
“There have been very much talks about sanctions, as well as methods that should be used by the Iranian crypto society to avoid harming sanctions.”

Outsourcing Government: How Deep-Pocketed Philanthropies Are Pushing Climate Policy In State Governments
by Michael Sandoval	March 9, 2018	
https://www.climateleadershipconference.org/
National elites in climate research, philanthropy, activism, and the private sector joined elected officials in Denver last week at the posh Four Seasons, a five-star high-rise hotel to strategize how to carry on a climate agenda without taxpayer dollars.
Former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy led a ‘Who’s Who’ of former administration policy advisers, climate activists, state regulators, politicians, and company officials through the three-day Climate Leadership Conference covering climate-related talks on collaboration between governments at all levels, various climate initiatives including the Paris agreement, and technological development.
Among those presenting were representatives of new state government outsourcing schemes, where philanthropy-backed legal fellows and policy wonks are placed with state attorneys general and governors’ policy shops to promote a climate agenda.
For the first time, the conference would not be on the taxpayers’ dime.
The conference’s primary sponsor in 2018 was Bloomberg Philanthropies. After seven years, the EPA announced it would not be the event’s headline sponsor this year, as it had been under McCarthy’s administration.
“The Agency has decided to discontinue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) involvement with the 2018 Climate Leadership Awards program. This includes canceling the 2018 Climate Leadership Awards as well as EPA’s sponsorship of the Climate Leadership Conference,” the EPA wrote.
The Adversarial Approach: Underwriting Legal Fellows
Even without the federal agency’s support, the conference didn’t skip a beat with its new, deep-pocketed sponsor.
“This year we are pleased to welcome Bloomberg Philanthropies as Headline Sponsor. Their support ensures that cities, states, and companies retain an important platform for climate action, and that we can continue to advance America’s Pledge, an initiative co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown that aims to aggregate and showcase the collective momentum of non-federal U.S. climate action,” the event’s co-hosts, the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) and The Climate Registry, wrote in their welcome.

The focus of “America’s Pledge” is on the “actions of states, cities, businesses, and other non-national actors in the United States” that commit to “the goals of the Paris Agreement.”
One of those “platforms” used to meet those goals is a new law fellowship aimed at pushing climate initiatives through friendly state attorney general offices.
David Hayes, Executive Director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University School of Law, spoke at the Denver conference on a panel for “Building Momentum for Climate Action.”
“Let me talk about state AGs . . . there is a tendency to think of state attorneys general as, ‘whoa, I don’t know if we’re ready to talk to them,’” Hayes said at the conference. “Those guys are the law enforcement folks.”
“When it comes to climate change and clean energy, they are enforcing the law in the way that I think all of us in this room want them to—at least the progressive AGs,” Hayes said.
“The AGs have been busy. Consistent with the theme of this conference, there has been a lot of activity at the state level,” Hayes continued, particularly states versus the federal government.
The focus of those battles is the new administration.
“There are two big buckets . . . one is defense, and that’s been a big part of the last 13 months. Because as we all know President Trump has looked to dismantle climate-related initiatives on a number of levels. Also, the administration has shown an obvious and concerning bias toward fossil fuels,” Hayes said.
“AGs have been a very strong line of defense in all these matters,” he said. Hayes pointed to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s leadership, and lawsuits such as those targeting the administration’s rescission of the Bureau of Land Management’s hydraulic fracturing rule.
Hayes served as Interior Department deputy secretary under the Obama and Clinton administrations.
Last August, NYU’s School of Law launched its new State Energy and Environmental Impact Center under Hayes’ leadership with a mission to provide law fellows to state attorney general offices courtesy of a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, named for the billionaire and former New York City mayor.
As Western Wire reported, in October New Mexico’s attorney general office was among the first seven to receive NYU Law fellows, alongside Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Washington, and Washington, D.C., members of the ‘Green 20’ group of attorneys general. Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Virginia were added in December. At least 14 fellows have been placed through the fellowship program.
The fellows–“special assistant attorneys general”—will work to “fight against regulatory rollbacks” like those Hayes mentioned in Denver.
Hayes introduced the center’s latest progress report late last month touting the aggressive actions launched by state attorneys general, including those who have accepted the law fellows.
“This report makes clear the outsized role state attorneys general are playing in advancing and defending progressive policies, regulations and values pertaining to environmental protection, the causes and impacts of a changing climate and the development of a clean energy economy,” Hayes wrote in a statement upon the report’s release ahead of the conference.
Collaborating—But With Whom?

Washington State Governor Jay Inslee turns to Reed Schuler, his Senior Policy Advisor for Climate and Sustainability, when he looks to “collaborate” on climate issues.
“I think it’s a really, really important time for partnerships,” Schuler said, speaking on a panel covering state climate actions. “It’s hard to imagine an issue that, more than climate change, requires that we all act together.”
Schuler’s top priority, the Paris climate agreement, required a partnership, he said. “It’s a partnership that respects both the diversity of different countries being in very different positions but all needing to take the plunge together,” Schuler said. That includes a shared goal “to send a signal to industry that everyone’s acting.”
While Inslee’s push for a state carbon-tax plan failed this year, he has traveled extensively as part of several climate initiatives, including the U.S. Climate Alliance. Schuler called the Alliance a Paris-style agreement “at the national scale.”
But Schuler isn’t accountable to taxpayers and voters, at least not in a traditional way, when it comes to the advice he offers to Inslee or Washington’s state government agencies.
Schuler isn’t a Washington government employee. Instead, he is paid by World Resources Institute, an environmental non-profit, and does contractual work—“activities and deliverables” in the state’s name on behalf of WRI.
On the arrangement between Schuler, WRI, and Washington State, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board said the “special-interest tail is officially wagging the democratic dog.” His policy influence is tremendous, according to the WSJ.
The paper highlighted Schuler’s contractual obligations.
“According to Mr. Schuler’s official job description, his duties include working to ‘identify policy ideas,’ ‘draft policy proposals and briefs for communication to Policy Director and Governor’s executive team,’ and ‘prepare letters, executive orders, and other directives for the Governor’s signature,’” the board noted.
Schuler is also tapped for outreach initiatives “among multi-state and international efforts,” presumably just like the Denver Climate Leadership Conference.
An Inslee spokeswoman, Tara Lee, said Schuler is “a Washington state employee with the same scope of work, review process and accountability as any other state employee. The only difference is the funding source.” Lee also defended WRI’s interest in the arrangement as “general support for expanding the Inslee Administration’s work to combat climate change,” but that the organization had no input on Schuler’s day-to-day work plan.
WRI said that such “public-private partnerships enable governments to hire experts to advise them on policies that benefit their constituents.”
But Schuler’s benefactors aren’t limited to the environmental non-profit. A deep-pocketed philanthropy with $9 billion in assets (as of 2016) are picking up his paycheck.
A July 2017 email revealed that Schuler’s position was backed by a grant from the Hewlett Foundation “so that WRI could provide support to Washington state to hire an expert analyst to help the state achieve its climate goals.”
The email was obtained through an open records request filed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Chris Horner.
WRI, though, did not lack the funds to support Schuler. A Seattle Times review of tax records showed that the organization held $108 million in assets in 2015.
A Failure Of Philanthropy
Writing in Nonprofit Chronicles, Marc Gunther assessed the current state of climate philanthropy, and while noting a few notable victories, like the support of Bloomberg Philanthropies for Sierra Club’s anti-coal campaign, the overall situation seemed much less impressive.
“If philanthropy is to be judged by its outcomes — and how else should it be judged? — climate philanthropy has failed,” Gunther wrote.
Gunther’s conclusion isn’t isolated.
“The big funders have learned way too little from the success of the conservative movement. They’ve spent millions and millions of dollars, and the climate movement, such as it is, continues to fail,” said Robert Brulle, a sociology professor at Drexel University.
Gunther quotes Edward Maibach, Director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, who concludes that despite spending billions on climate advocacy, “What is missing are the constituents who feel so strongly about this issue that they have created a potent political force.”
In other words, while the paid activists garner media attention and the foundations make noise, the votes are not materializing, at least not in the numbers one could expect from multi-billion dollar spending over the past decade.
A poll this week released by Civis Analytics, a polling outfit drawn from Obama’s 2012 campaign, shows “climate change” a distant fifth in priorities for a Democratic president and Congress in 2021.

AGENDA | VIDEOS | REPORTS
Green Cross International organized a meeting in Geneva on October 6-7, 2015 in preparation for the COP21 meeting on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015. Nine Fellows of WAAS made presentations at the conference on issues related to a global strategy for addressing climate change. A summary of findings was prepared by the organizers, presented at the WAAS meeting at CERN on November 10th, and released to the press before COP21. Following COP 21, WAAS and WUC joined with GCI, Club of Rome and other organizations to issue a joint statement regarding the outcome of COP21 and the future challenges facing humanity to address the climate challenge. WAAS representatives, Garry Jacobs, Adam Koniuszewski, Martin Lees, Alexander Likhotal, Mohan Munasinghe, Roberto Peccei, Franz Josef Radermacher, Ivo Šlaus and Ernst von Weizsäcker presented at the conference.

OVERVIEW
The World Academy of Art and Science is composed of 730 individual Fellows from diverse cultures, nationalities, and intellectual disciplines, chosen for eminence in art, the natural and social sciences, and the humanities. Established in 1960 by distinguished individuals concerned by the impact of the explosive growth of knowledge, its activities seek to address global issues related to the social consequences and policy implications of knowledge. The Academy serves as a forum for reflective scientists, artists, and scholars to discuss the vital problems of humankind independent of political boundaries or limits, whether spiritual or physical -- a forum where these problems can be discussed objectively, scientifically, globally, and free from vested interests or regional attachments, to arrive at solutions that affirm universal human rights and serve the interests of all humanity. WAAS is founded on faith in the power of original and creative ideas -- Real Ideas with effective power -- to change the world. Its motto is "Leadership in thought that leads to action."
The spirit of the Academy can be expressed in the words of Albert Einstein: "The creations of our mind shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind." Its Fellows share the ambition (as the Founders said in their 1960 Manifesto) "to rediscover the language of mutual understanding," surmounting differences in tradition, language, and social structure which, unless fused by creative imagination and continuous effort, dissolve the latent human commonwealth in contention and conflict.
The aim of the Academy's founders was to function as "an informal WORLD UNIVERSITY at the highest scientific and ethical level, in which deep human understanding and the fullest sense of responsibility will meet."
MISSION
The World Academy of Art and Science is an association of committed individuals drawn from diverse cultures, nationalities, occupations and intellectual pursuits spanning the arts, humanities and sciences, conscious of the profound social consequences and policy implications of knowledge, and united by a common aspiration to address the urgent challenges and emerging opportunities confronting humanity today. Our mission is to promote cross-disciplinary dialogue generative of original ideas and integrated perspectives that comprehend the root causes and effective remedies for our common problems, while furthering those currents of thought and social movement that affirm the value of human dignity and equitable development. The Academy dedicates itself to the pursuit of creative, catalytic ideas that can provide to present and future generations enlightened leadership in thought that leads to effective action.
HISTORY
The idea of founding an international association for exploring major concerns of humanity in a nongovernmental context grew out of many conversations that took place among leading scientists and intellectuals in the years following World War II. Prominent among this group were people such as Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer who had played a part in the development of the atomic bomb and were deeply concerned about how it and other scientific advances might be used – or misused.
This informal project took a major step forward in 1956, when a meeting – The First International Conference on Science and Human Welfare – was held in Washington, D. C. The organizers were two American scientists: Richard Montgomery Field of Princeton, who had worked for many years as chairman of an international committee on the social values of science; and John A. Fleming, former President of the International Council of Scientific Unions. At the end of the conference, participants agreed to take steps toward the formation of a World Academy, and elected an International Preparatory Committee for that purpose. Its members were: (from France) Pierre Chouard, George Laclavére and G. Le Lionnaise; (from the United Kingdom) Ritchie Calder, H. Munro Fox and Joseph Needham; and (from the United States) Robert Oppenheimer.
The Academy was formally founded (and its first officers elected) in 1960. They were: as President, Lord John Boyd Orr of Scotland; as Vice Presidents, Hermann Joseph Muller of the United States and Hugo Ostvald of Sweden; and, as Secretary General, Hugo Boyko of Israel.

The Security & Sustainability Guide
A 250-page “Interim Draft” PDF of The S&S Guide, a project of the World Academy of Art & Science, will be available for limited distribution free of charge. It reflects the critical fact that sustainability and security are both essential and can only be achieved in concert. The Guide is incomplete, but the compilers believe that, even in its current state, many will find it useful for illuminating many of the most serious problems facing humanity under the broad, overlapping categories of “Security” (weapons proliferation, terrorism, cyber-attacks, economic and food insecurity, human rights, peacemaking, crime and corruption, inadequate infrastructure, etc.) and “Sustainability” (climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, energy, agriculture, population growth, cities, oceans, forests, vulnerability to disasters, green economics and nance, etc.)

Future of Democracy: Challenges & Opportunities - Recent Course
Democracy is under siege. Traditional bastions of liberal democracy are faltering. Young democracies are reverting to their authoritarian pasts. Populism, corporatization of the media, fake news, retreat from globalism, oligarchy, corruption and other perils are undermining fairness, effectiveness and truthfulness. Just when it appeared that the world was converging on a universal set of values and standards for governance at the national and international level, fundamental questions are being raised regarding the viability and sustainability of democratic institutions. Recent events raise fundamental questions regarding the institutions of governance and also about the underlying social, psychological, cultural and evolutionary processes that determine how these institutions function.
Is democracy in its current form really the most viable and effective system of governance? Are human beings sufficiently rational and selfless to govern themselves justly and effectively? Is the future of democracy at the national level compatible with the persistence of non-democratic institutions at the international level? By what process has the distribution of social power shifted from army, monarchy, aristocracy to democracy and how is that process likely to evolve further in future? To what extent are the institutional problems confronting democracy today reflections of underlying social, psychological and cultural factors and processes? What proven and potential safeguards and remedies are available to address the failures and insufficiencies of contemporary democracies? Is democracy the best possible system or merely a stage in the evolution of governance toward something more stable, an effective and equitable system?

Mind, Thinking & Creativity - Recent Course
Mind is humanity's highest developed instrument for seeking knowledge. It is the master tool that we use to comprehend the present, remember the past, and anticipate and plan for the future. From the act of striking two flints together to create fire to combining strings of 1s and 0s to design the code for supercomputers, mind has enabled humanity to create remarkable technologies and organized global institutions. The mind is the unifying foundation on which humanity’s entire social evolution is based. To understand this vital instrument better, the World Academy of Art & Science and World University Consortium have launched a ground-breaking project to explore Mind, Thinking and Creativity. A greater understanding of the nature of mind, its ways of knowing, the limits to thinking and rationality, mind's untapped potential, the workings of creativity and genius are essential for addressing the challenges confronting humanity today.
In April 2016 WAAS and WUC, along with partnering organizations IACP, IUC, DHUC, and MSS organized a four-day roundtable on Mind, Thinking and Creativity 2016 at Dubrovnik, Croatia for to explore fundamental questions. The meeting was attended by experts from different fields of natural and social science, including medicine, neuroscience, engineering, psychology, sociology, economics, law, and philosophy. Video recordings, presentations and papers for the roundtable are available here. The enthusiastic interest generated by the Dubrovnik meeting spurred efforts of WAAS and the World University Consortium to commence work on a on-line course on this subject which is now underway. A report on last year's meeting including videos and presentations was included in the Academy's July 2016 newsletter.
Roundtable 2 -- November 2017 at Dubrovnik
The second roundtable on Mind, Thinking & Creativity is being conducted by the World University Consortium, the World Academy of Art & Science, the Mother's Service Society, Person-Centered Approach Institute, Dag Hammarskjöld University College of International Relations and Diplomacy and the Inter-University Centre from November 6-8, 2017 at Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia.

Human-Centered Economics - Recent Course
A Post-Graduate Certificate Course in Human-Centered Economics will be conducted by the World Academy of Art & Science, the World University Consortium, The Mother's Service Society, Person-Centered Approach Institute, Dag Hammarskjöld University College of International Relations and Diplomacy and Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia from Feb 1-Feb 3,2017 at Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia.
The multidimensional challenges confronting humanity today are human-made and can be changed by a change in thought and action. Contemporary economic thought is built on a mind-frame that originated prior to the Industrial Revolution when scarcity of goods in a world of abundant resources was the primary concern, economic growth was considered synonymous with human welfare, and impact of humanity on the environment was completely ignored. Without challenging obvious flaws in existing theory, it will be not be possible to significantly alter current policies and practices.
The overall aim of the course is to (a) demonstrate why mainstream neo-classical economic theory is inappropriate for dealing with the global challenges of the c.21st, and (b) explore alternative approaches for achieving ecologically sustainable, human-centered development and welfare for all.
This course will present the findings of a five year research program of the World Academy of Art & Science and the on-going work of the New Economic Theory working group. It will harness the best available ideas and practices on human-centred, sustainable economy to create informative, authoritative and compelling educational and communication tools with the power to challenge and alter university level education in Economics, public policy, business decisions, media coverage and general public opinion regarding how the world economy should and can work for the betterment of all humanity.

Social Power - Recent Course
A Post-Graduate Certificate Course in Social Power, Empowerment & Social Evolution will be conducted by the World Academy of Art & Science, the World University Consortium, The Mother's Service Society, Person-Centered Approach Institute, Dag Hammarskjöld University College of International Relations and Diplomacy and Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia from Oct 31-Nov 4, 2016 at Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia.
Humanity lives in a time of unprecedented capacity for accomplishment in every field of social life. Never before have we possessed power of this magnitude for good or for evil. Never before has power been so widely distributed within society. Democracy, law, human rights, science, technology, education and many other forms of social organization have generated immense power. Society governs the possession and exercise of this power through formal structures and institutions, such as law and human rights, as well as through both legitimate and extra-legal informal mechanisms including status, wealth, popularity, political influence and corruption. The distribution of power in its various forms powerfully impacts on the functioning of the economy, political system, educational, scientific, religious and and other social institutions, and on the overall productivity, strength, integrity, harmony and welfare of society. This transdisciplinary course will explore the sources, expressions, determinants and consequences of the creation, distribution and exercise of social power in its various expressions in politics, economy, society and culture and its consequences for the evolution of society as a whole.

Mind, Thinking & Creativity - Recent Course
Mind is humanity’s highest developed instrument for seeking knowledge. It is an instrument with remarkable capabilities and characteristic limitations. It is ironic that we invest so little time in education and scientific endeavor trying to understand the nature of mental knowledge and the character of the mental processes by which we arrive at it. The objective of this course is to arrive at an understanding of the inherent limits to rationality and mental ways of knowing, as well as the extraordinary creative and intuitive processes by which mind transcends those limitations and tends toward genius.
Thinking is the activity by which mind associates, organizes, coordinates and integrates information, thoughts and ideas. Creative thinking is the process by which mind extends the boundaries of existing thought and knowledge to connect, reconcile and unify previously unconnected or contradictory perspectives. This course will explore the characteristics of mental knowledge and thought processes, types of thinking, the character of rational thought, the mental and social construction of knowledge, deep thinking, creativity and genius. Rather than focus on abstract philosophical concepts, it will apply this knowledge to understand both the sources of humanity’s prolific mental creativity, the characteristic problems it confronts due to irresolvable conflicts and contradictions between mental perspectives, and their resolution in different fields of natural and social science, public policy, collective and individual behavior.

Future Education - Recent Course
A Post-Graduate Certificate Course in Future Education was conducted by the World Academy of Art & Science, the World University Consortium, The Mother's Service Society, Person-Centered Approach Institute, Dag Hammarskjöld University College of International Relations and Diplomacy and Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia from September 21-23, 2015 at Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia.
Education is our best hope for a better future. Emergence of a new paradigm in education can radically abridge the time required for humanity to address critical issues related to economy, governance, ecology and life-style. Education is the best known instrument for ensuring universal human rights, promoting democracy, enhancing productivity and protecting the environment.There is urgent need to evolve a new paradigm in education appropriate to the needs of the 21st century. Closing the gap between social needs and educational capabilities is essential for addressing pressing challenges confronting humanity today. A review of education today makes evident that there is enormous scope for improving and developing the educational system. Whatever its current limitations in terms of inadequate coverage, quality and content, the means and potential exist for dramatically enhancing humanity’s individual and collective performance in virtually all spheres of our social existence by realistic, achievable improvements in education. We need a new paradigm in education capable of more fully and effectively developing the latent capacities of our youth.

Essence of Effective Leadership - Recent Course
A Post-Graduate Certificate Course in Essence of Effective Leadership was conducted by the World Academy of Art & Science, the World University Consortium, The Mother's Service Society, Person-Centered Approach Institute, Dag Hammarskjöld University College of International Relations and Diplomacy and Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia from March 31 to April 3, 2015 at Inter-University Centre, Dubrovnik, Croatia.
This course explored the characteristics common to leaders in business, politics, civil society, science, arts, professions and education and examined methods by which these characteristics can be consciously developed by individuals. The presentations consist of theory, practical strategies, and a wide range of examples drawn from biography, history, management, and literature from movies illustrating the principles under discussion. Apart from the presentations, our faculty interacted with participants to bring home the theoretical significance and practical relevance of the material.

Individual Accomplishment, Growth & the Character of Life in Management, History,
Literature, and Psychology - Recent Course
The Individual is the catalyst of all social progress, the source of creativity, innovation, new ideas and new initiatives. The individual is the genetic source of human diversity. The entrepreneur, inventor, social reformer, revolutionary leader, original thinker and creative artist are a few of individuality's expressions. Yet how little we understand about the characteristics of true individuality, the ways in which it expresses, the means for developing it, and the means for realizing real individuality in one’s own life.
History demonstrates that individuals have the power to change the world. This course explored the relationship between personality and accomplishment. It examined the role of Individuality and Values in personal achievement, growth of personality and social progress drawing on evidence from Management Science, History, Psychology and Literature. It explored the relationship between creative individuals and society searching for insights into the principles and process that govern successful human initiatives and their consequences in various fields of life.
The course was intended for both students and practitioners in all fields interested in advancing theoretical understanding and practical approaches to promote the development of entrepreneurship, individuality, creativity, original thinking and other forms of social innovation. It explored the role of the individual in development of society, elucidated the characteristics of true individuals, the source of their amazing power for accomplishment and the process by which they act as catalysts of social innovation. While the presentation was academic, the objective was to impart original insights and practical knowledge for personal growth and individuation.

Toward a Trans-disciplinary Science of Society - Recent Course
Today humanity is confronted by a plethora of serious challenges – political, economic, legal, social, cultural, psychological and ecological. These challenges are complex, interrelated, and global in reach. They are a reflection of the inadequacy of current institutions and policies and at a deeper level the inadequacy of current knowledge. They defy comprehension and resolution based on the prevailing principles of social science. The specialized knowledge developed by separate disciplines is inadequate to deal with the increasingly complex interdependencies of the real world. Knowledge needs to evolve to keep pace with the evolution of society.
The evolution of a complex, highly integrated global society necessitates the development of a more comprehensive and integrated science of society. The division into various specialized fields has been a useful mental strategy for the development of the social sciences, leading to significant advances in all fields – knowledge which needs to be preserved and enhanced by future developments. Yet it is increasingly evident that a more comprehensive and integrated approach is now required. As society evolves, its different functions develop greater complexity. At the same time they become more closely and complexly interlinked and interdependent on one another. Economy today is highly dependent on the political system and laws governing the distribution and enforcement of power in society, legal concepts regarding ownership of property and human rights, public institutions responsible for the creation and management of money, rules for commerce between nations, public policies influencing income and wealth distribution, processes that determine collective decision-making, public investment in education and training, and social expectations regarding economy and the future, etc. A recent announcement by the White House of an ‘intention’ to examine measures to discourage shifting of US firms to tax havens overseas resulted in a 10% fall in market value for several large firms.

Strategic Planning Committee Program Framework
Being a world academy composed of members drawn from the arts, social and physical sciences, humanities, business, public administration and civil society poses fundamental questions. How can WAAS distinguish itself from other national and regional academies? Is there really a common meeting point between art and science? Is there a unique contribution that WAAS can make to the world’s knowledge?
At the New Delhi General Assembly, Fellows explored facets of a new program framework developed by the Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) which seeks to answer these questions in the affirmative. Rather than distinguish itself by specializing on a particular set of disciplines, issues or geographic area, the framework is an attempt to formulate a comprehensive approach and integrated perspective of knowledge inclusive of all disciplinary perspectives and applicable to social problems and opporunities in all fields.
The core of the framework is a human-centered conception of what constitutes reliable knowing, a question posed to the SPC by Ruben Nelson. In his presentation to the GA, Garry Jacobs explained how this conception applies to WAAS’s projects on new economic theory, individuality and limits to rationality. Pushpa Bhargava pointed out that a human centered perspective naturally incorporates ecology, since the survival and full development of humanity depends on its capacity to evolve in harmony with the environment.

New Paradigm Program
Scope: The world confronts multiple crises, each of which resists current efforts at resolution and appears intractable. The environmental crisis of climate change occupied the center stage in the mid-2000s. Fears of nuclear weapons proliferation, which had subsided into complacency in the years following the end of the Cold War, suddenly surfaced with renewed intensity when Korea tested nuclear weapons and long range missiles and news surfaced of Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program in 2007.
Then the subprime mortgage crisis exploded in late 2008, spreading havoc through financial markets across the world. It was followed quickly by a sudden and substantial slowing of economic growth in OECD countries, rising levels of unemployment and most recently a crisis of excessive government debt.
In spite of the enormous attention being given to each of these issues by specialists nationally and internationally, progress on all fronts appears to be nearly at a standstill or at least far too slow to meet pressing human concerns. The times we live in are a Wild West of globalization and the unbridled, unregulated expansion of international activities threatens to destabilize and undermine the remarkable progress of the previous five decades.
This project is predicated on the assumption that each of these problems defies solution because they all represent problems that transcend the sovereign powers of the nation-state. None of them can be fully and satisfactorily addressed by nation-states acting individually. All are symptoms of the evolution of world society to a stage where concerted and coordinated global action is required to meet the collective needs of humanity for peace, security, financial stability, economic welfare and sustainable development. This project has been conceived to address the underlying and interrelated issues that all these challenges pose to global governance.

TRANS-DISCIPLINARY DIALOGUE ON MIND, THINKING AND CREATIVITY
Mind is humanity’s highest developed instrument for seeking knowledge. It is an instrument with remarkable capabilities and characteristic limitations. It is ironic that we invest so little time in education and scientific endeavor trying to understand the nature of mental knowledge and the character of the mental processes by which we arrive at it.
The objective of this project is to arrive at an understanding of the inherent limits to rationality and mental ways of knowing, as well as the extraordinary creative and intuitive processes by which mind transcends those limitations and tends toward genius.
Concept Note
PROGRAM ON GLOBAL EMPLOYMENT CHALLENGE
Access to employment is the most essential requirement for providing economic security to the world’s burgeoning population.
This interdisciplinary dialogue explores theoretical and practical aspects of the global employment challenge, including its demographic, economic, legal, political, psychological dimensions as well as linkages with the international financial crisis, social stability, and terrorism.

EVOLUTION OF INDIVIDUALITY
Individuality is the crown of human evolution and the catalyst for social progress, yet there are very different conceptions of what constitutes true individuality, the relationship between the individual and society, and whether humanity is inevitably evolving toward higher levels of individuality.
This project will explore the essential nature of individuality, the social and cultural factors that foster it, its role in social development, its myriad expressions in the original thinker, creative artist, political leader, entrepreneur, inventor and social innovator, and the means available to society to foster it.

GLOBAL RULE OF LAW
The evolution of international law and human rights represent crucial threads in the progressive development of global rule of law.
This project will explore the relationship between the social, political and legal dimensions of global rule of law in an effort to frame the boundaries of a wider approach to the evolution of global governance. Emphasis will be place to re-examining the concept of national sovereignty and the common rights of humanity in an increasingly globalized world.

PROGRAM ON ABOLITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
The devastating consequences of nuclear war and the potential destructive applications of science and technology were paramount concerns among Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Robert Oppenheimer, Joseph Rotblat and others which led to the founding of the World Academy in 1960.
Nuclear disarmament is a sine qua non for effectively addressing other issues of global important – terrorism, financial stability, unemployment, poverty, climate change, democratization of the UN and other aspects of global governance. In recent years, the Academy has conducted numerous conferences, seminars and workshops and collaborating with other organizations in an effort to promote concrete steps toward immediate and total global nuclear disarmament.

The Security & Sustainability Guide
A 250-page “Interim Draft” PDF of The S&S Guide, a project of the World Academy of Art & Science, will be available for limited distribution free of charge. It reflects the critical fact that sustainability and security are both essential and can only be achieved in concert. The Guide is incomplete, but the compilers believe that, even in its current state, many will find it useful for illuminating many of the most serious problems facing humanity under the broad, overlapping categories of “Security” (weapons proliferation, terrorism, cyber-attacks, economic and food insecurity, human rights, peacemaking, crime and corruption, inadequate infrastructure, etc.) and “Sustainability” (climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, energy, agriculture, population growth, cities, oceans, forests, vulnerability to disasters, green economics and nance, etc.)

Four Tools You Can Use to Improve Pistol Marksmanship (and Save Money)
quote ·	09. February 2015 · Write a comment	
This article was originally published by Joshua Krause at The Daily Sheeple.
For as long as guns have been around, shooters have sought out innovative ways to increase their accuracy, and prepare themselves for real world combat situations. But for the longest time, this has mainly consisted of spending a lot of time on the range repetitively shooting sterile paper targets, or if you have the money, going through shooting simulations on an obstacle course. While an ideal training method for real world conditions, shooting simulations are usually out of the reach of most gun enthusiasts and are mainly reserved police and military personnel.
But over time technology is starting to give everyday shooters the means to hone their skills in a convenient and affordable manner. As early as 1989, the military was using SNES light gun games (the same technology used to play Duck Hunt) to help train their soldiers without burning through expensive ammunition. Since that time there have been several awesome developments in the field of marksmanship training, and we can expect some great shooting technologies to come along in the near future. But until that time comes, here’s what we have so far.
Below, I’m going to briefly go through a list of tools you can use to help your accuracy, starting with the latest and most expensive option, and working our way down to the cheapest and most rudimentary. None of these devices are brand new, and some of them have been around for a long time, but all of them have the potential to step up your marksmanship game; specifically in terms of pistol shooting, arguable the most challenging class of firearms to master. Let’s get started shall we?
LaserLyte TLB-RT
The LaserLyte became very popular at the height of the ammo shortages we saw a few years ago, and for very good reason. It gives you the ability to accurately measure your shooting skills without using any real ammunition. While the initial cost is pretty steep, it more than pays for itself with the money you save on ammo.
It works with a laser boresight that fits inside the chamber of your gun, but unlike a normal laser it doesn’t run continuously. It emits a quick flash of light when the firing pin strikes the laser, which then registers on a light receiver that is shaped like a bulls-eye.
This receiver gives you two options: training mode, which is just a simple point and shoot option that records where you hit, and reaction mode, which emits random led lights on the screen for intervals of 3-7 seconds. When you hit these targets in this mode, the device beeps and lights up.
But the most valuable aspect of the Laserlyte system isn’t the ammunition you save. It gives you the ability to practice things like drawing and firing, which would normally be prohibited on a firing range.
Sightmark Laser Boresight
Now let’s move on to some of the cheaper tools. Boresights have been used for a long time to sight-in firearms. By shining a laser down the barrel of the gun, they make it pretty easy to adjust your sights without using any ammunition. But that’s not what I’m going to go over today.
Personally, I’ve used boresights as a kind of poor man’s version of the LaserLyte system. You can actually use the LaserLyte boresight for this, but since the light from that device is only emitted for a fraction of a second, I don’t find it very useful without the rest of the LaserLyte kit. I prefer a traditional boresight, like the SightMark laser, which lets out a continuous beam.
My method is pretty simple. Turn on the boresight, and place it in the chamber of the pistol. Find yourself a blank wall, and place stickers of various sizes and colors on it. Now, find a target you want to aim at, close your eyes, and draw your weapon. Open your eyes and see how close you were to the target, then rinse and repeat until you get it right. This is a great way to practice your instinctive shooting skills.
It does have some limitations, but again, this is the poor man’s version. I’m pretty sure your typical boresight isn’t design to absorb the strike of a firing pin, so you can’t really practice your trigger control with this method. But if that’s something you want, I’d recommend the sure strike laser ammo. This is a laser round for a system that is similar to the LaserLyte, except you can buy different adapters that will either give you a quick flash of light, or a continuous beam. You can also replace the snap cap part if it wears out.
Snap Cap Bullets
The boresights described in the above entries are great for practicing your trigger control, but unfortunately they will wear out at some point. Especially the LaserLyte bullet, which doesn’t give you the option to replace the cap that absorbs the firing pin. Some of these devices cost between 50 and 80 dollars, so if they break down on you, that’s a lot of money down the drain.
If you’re just starting out and need to spend more time practicing your trigger control, it might be a good idea to buy some cheap dummy rounds first. You can usually buy a pack of 5 for less than 20 bucks, and each one will be able to sustain thousands of strikes. And since you have to manually re-chamber a round every time you fire, having only one laser round can get pretty tedious after a while. Having five dummy rounds that you can load into your magazine means you can quickly reload several times without losing your focus.
Gripmaster
I’m guessing you weren’t expecting to find exercise equipment on this list, but here it is. Using a gripmaster is an effective way to improve your trigger control, and to maintain your aim between shots. If you have a weak hand, the gun is liable to shift slightly after every shot, forcing you to readjust over and over again. So not only will it make your shots more accurate, but it will help you shoot faster and with more consistency.
For this reason, it’s apparently become very popular among law enforcement agencies and military personnel. Though there’s a wide variety of exercise equipment to choose from, I’d recommend the gripmaster that is designed to strengthen your fingers with individual spring-loaded tabs. Shooting a handgun isn’t just about forearm and hand strength. Finger dexterity is a major factor as well.
So if you’re new to the shooting scene, I’m guessing you’ve probably already put down a lot of cash on a firearm, as well as ammo and equipment to go with it. It’s an expensive hobby for sure, but it’s also a very valuable skill that every independent minded person should master. Just know that it is possible to practice this sport without breaking the bank, and with devices like these, you can quite literally get the most bang for your buck.

Government Secretly Taps AP's Phones For Months
It is amazing the information coming out now that Obama has been safely reelected.
http://apnews.myway.com/article/20130513/DA68MMQ82.html
"The Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press in what the news cooperative's top executive called a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into how news organizations gather the news.
The records obtained by the Justice Department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. It was not clear if the records also included incoming calls or the duration of the calls.
In all, the government seized the records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown, but more than 100 journalists work in the offices where phone records were targeted, on a wide array of stories about government and other matters.
In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies."

Hayek explained later.Designer handbags“And to have work, you needed volume, and volume was only achievable with watches like Swatch.”Once he had stabilized the Replica Rolex Watches industry, Hayek turned his attention to his prestige brands. Watchmakers were born, lived, and died in the Vallee de Joux where most of the prestige names –handbagreplica ,Watches Replica – where headquartered and there was a “Vallee mentality,” UK Replica watches as Hayek saw it.

ChiIL Mama : OPENING: World Premiere Journey for the Sun: A SciFi Cartoon Circus Via Actors Gymnasium Through March 25th
Thursday, February 15, 2018
OPENING: World Premiere Journey for the Sun: A SciFi Cartoon Circus Via Actors Gymnasium Through March 25th
Chi, IL LIVE Shows On Our Radar:
Buckle into your jetpacks, put on three pairs of sunglasses, and blast toward a galactic, uncanny and steel-meltingly sizzling world premiere!
Here at ChiIL Mama & ChiIL Live Shows, we're astronomically excited for Actors Gymnasium's latest. We love it when our friends play well together and this AG collaboration with Frank Maugeri & Lindsey Whiting is sure to be stellar. I'll be out for the press opening with my whole circus lovin' family on 2/17 so check back soon for my full review.
We've been fans of Actors Gymnasium's excellent productions for years, and their winter show, featuring a cast of circus professionals and the highly talented AG Teen Ensemble, is always something to see. I've been consistently wowed over the years by the creativity, high-caliber circus skills, and extreme entertainment value of Actors Gymnasium's winter shows. My two teens are not in this production, but have immensely enjoyed being cast in AG's last 4 fall and spring youth circus shows.
Advanced tickets are highly recommended, as their performance space is intimate and shows sell out fast. Special opening night tickets for Saturday 2/17/18 are available for $60 and include an after party. ChiIL Mama will be there... will YOU?! Discount tickets are available in conjunction with Chicago Theatre Week for Sunday's matinee on 2/18/18. Details below. Don't miss this!

In 1964, the sun is overheating and The Owner of an Indiana drive-in movie theater is called upon to save earth with an unlikely bunch of heros. Will The Owner and their sidekicks be able to save the galaxy and avert a human-made environmental catastrophe?
The creative team brings to life an enormous intergalactic robot and Poppie, a real life talking popcorn machine in this SciFi Cartoon Circus adventure! Journey for the Sun features astonishing aerialists, insane acrobatics, sophisticated puppetry, in-depth object design, film and cartoon animation.
Written by Seth Bockley and Co-directed by Frank Maugeri (from Cabinet of Curiosity Events and the late Redmoon Theater), and Lindsey Noel Whiting, Circus choreography by Sylvia Hernandez - DiStasi, original music by Kevin O'Donnell and costumes by Sully Ratke. The cast includes Kasey Foster, Jean Carlos, Yuri Lane : The Human Beatbox, and members of The Actors Gymnasium Teen Ensemble.

He is also the Community Programs Artistic Director at the Chicago Children's Theatre where he develops educational classes and camps for children 0 - 14, and selects and supports the CCT teaching community.

ChiIL Travel Kids will archive all of our travel related posts. We will feature family friendly, quirky, eco-friendly, off the beaten path destinations around the US and around the world.
We'll also feature guest spots from other bloggers and families living abroad with kids, so you can eat and play like a local and not like a tourist. Check out our photo and video filled travel archives today.

And you don't find it at all disconcerting that economists from both sides of the aisle are saying this will destroy our credit rating by showing the world that we no longer adhere to the full faith and credit of our currency?
Plenty of Conservative economists and long-time commentators have said that a Trump presidency would be substantially more harmful than a Clinton presidency. Do you pay them no mind?

I know I've asked you this before, but I'm still hoping to get an answer from you about it.
Do you support Trump's belief that the United States should get more debt, under the impression that we could buy back our debt at a lower right later on?
Because neither Clinton's nor Sanders' policies will do enough economic damage to come ever close to the fallout from Trump's proposal.

I'm well aware, and I had previously condemned the NYT for this when it happened. I have no issue with condemning media that I share a bias with.
I was simply curious why you seem to.

Of course there are like minded Jews, read the article that you posted. He is the leader of a small ultra-Orthodox party.
The fact that they are known in Israel as being ultra-Orthodox is proof in and of itself that most people do not believe that.

The American Parody Paradox.
Either A, you know the Cinco de Mayo is not cellebrate in Mexico and you are trolling, or B, you really know that little about the culture you are lashing out against.
The paradox is that level of cultural ignorance is standard in this country, so it's essentially impossible to determine whether or not you are being serious.

How many Native American languages have you learned? If you don't know any, why did you come here?
Jokes aside, there are dozens of ways people end up in this country, and many ways that one can end up living here without learning English.
You really have no ethical, political, or legal justification for vaguely lashing out at them. Instead, why not advocate for policies that help teach English to those who don't currently speak it?
It's going to work far better than generalized xenophobic comments like "Fuck whatever country you are from".

Except I specifically referred to the peaceful protests, and condemned the violent protestors that you just mentioned.
So what was the point of that comment?

Re-read the comment you are responding to (the one you quoted).
One does not have to forcibly suppress opposition in order to adhere more closely to fascist ideology.
So, let's look at the primary aspects of Fascism, and compare Trump to the people you are claiming are fascist.
1. Powerful Nationalism. Considering you and Trump are claiming that those who disagree with you are "Anti-American", and his entire campaign is predicated upon "Make America Great Again", this one should be pretty clear.
2. Ascribing lesser importance to human rights. Trump has regularly advocated deporting people (including those who are here legally) based upon his preconceptions of groups they belong to. He opposes the equal application and protection of the United States Constitution for sexual minorities. The protestors, on the other hand, are against him for these exact types of reasons.
3. Identification of Scapegoats. This one should be very easy to see. From China, to Mexicans, to Muslims, "the other" is regularly to blame for all the ills we face, according to Trump, and only he can show these no good foreigners what we are made of.
Those on the left who protest him regularly criticize his use of scapegoats.
4. Supremacy of Armed Forces. Despite ceaseless long-term increases in military spending, and a military budget that remains leaps and bounds over the the next 10 top spenders, Trump has promised to "rebuild the military".
I'm sure you believe the Left wants to gut out military, on the other hand.
5. Reliance upon traditional Patriarchy. From Trump's comments on Megyn Kelly, to his comments on the contestants of The Apprentice, Trump has reinforced his position as a chauvinist many, many, many times.
I'm willing to bet you can't find evidence of patriarchal comments from the protestors.
6. Controlled Media. This particular one is pretty much null, as neither he, nor the protestors, had control over the media. That said, the fake personality he created in order to lie to journalists with the intent of manipulating them shows a desire for such control, albeit not in a forceful manner.
7. Obsession with National Security. This is differentiated from a normal concern with national security in that the subject regularly uses fear and the topic of national security for political gain. We can see this with Trump and his ban on Muslims and his border wall, among other things.
The Left, on the other hand, is regularly accused by people such as yourself of ignoring national security.
8. Religion and Government. On this particularly instance, neither Trump nor the protestors are guilty of trying to intertwine religion and government.
9. Corporate Power Protected. This one should be pretty obvious, as Trump has advocated decreased regulations for pretty much every industry he has ever mentioned.
The Left and the protestors, on the other hand, are regularly portrayed by the right as "anti-business".
10. Suppression of Labor. This is probably most easily seen in his business practices. His company has regularly been anti-Union, and regularly employs foreign labor (whilst saying he would end the practice).
11. Anti-Intellectualism and Arts. "I love the poorly educated.” - Trump
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment. "We have got to get a lot tougher" - Trump "Letha Injection is too comfortable" - Trump
13. Cronyism and Corruption. Trump has regularly maintained relations with state and national government that he uses to further his company (aka Crony Capitalism). Even the National Review, one of the most prestigious Conservative publications in the U.S., considers him a Crony Capitalist.
14. Fraudulent Elections. This one he gets a pass on, as the possible electoral fraud looked like it would have been directed at him within the Republican Primary.

US to probe Big Tech on ‘stifling’ free speech

WASHINGTON, Sept 6: President Donald Trump’s administration warned Wednesday of a possible legal crackdown on big technology companies over competition or political bias, in a bombshell announcement that came as social media executives were defending their policies before lawmakers.
The Justice Department statement appeared to escalate a war between the administration and Silicon Valley after a series of attacks by Trump claiming tech firms were biased against conservatives.
According to the statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions will convene a meeting of state attorneys general later this month “to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”
The suggestions of legal or regulatory action caught many tech industry observers by surprise and came as lawmakers were holding hearings on foreign influence campaigns on social media and “transparency.” Daniel Castro, of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said the intent of the statement was not clear, but that it was worrisome.
“Social media platforms have the right to determine what types of legal speech they will permit on their platforms,” Castro said.
“The federal government should not use the threat of law enforcement to limit companies from exercising this right. In particular, law enforcement should not threaten social media companies with unfounded investigations.”
Legal analysts have noted the government would have little recourse against any political bias even if proven because of constitutional free speech guarantees.
While antitrust concerns against Google and Facebook are to be expected, Eric Goldman of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University said it would be troublesome to use antitrust law as a guise for regulating speech.
“This (statement) makes me think antitrust is not the real goal, that the real goal is censorship,” Goldman said.
“This could be broad action by the government to try to subvert the First Amendment.” Matt Schruers of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that includes Google and Facebook, said tech firms “compete aggressively with one another as well as those outside of the technology sector” and that “consumers have many choices for information services and news sources online.”
The administration statement came at the conclusion of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing at which Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg testified.
The hearing offered a largely collegial atmosphere in which the executives and senators spoke of the need for further efforts to thwart foreign influence campaigns on social media.
Dorsey said the messaging service was set up to function as a “public square” but had failed to deal with “abuse, harassment, troll armies, propaganda through bots.” “We aren’t proud of how that free and open exchange has been weaponized and used to distract and divide people, and our nation,” he told senators.
Sandberg repeated Facebook’s acknowledgements about failing to crack down on influence campaigns stemming from Russia that interfered with the 2016 US presidential election.
“We were too slow to spot this and too slow to act,” Sandberg told the panel. “That’s on us. This interference was completely unacceptable. It violated the values of our company and of the country we love.”
Lawmakers welcomed the comments but expressed concern about whether enough was being done.
“If the answer is regulation, let’s have an honest dialogue about what that looks like,” said Senator Richard Burr, the committee chairman.
Senator Mark Warner told the hearing that social media firms “were caught flat-footed by the brazen attacks on our election” and added: “I’m skeptical that, ultimately, you’ll be able to truly address this challenge on your own.”
The Senate was followed by a House panel session on “transparency and accountability,” where Dorsey rejected claims of political bias.
“Twitter cannot rightly serve as a public square if it’s constructed around the personal opinions of its makers,” he told the panel. “We believe a key driver of a thriving public square is the fundamental human right of freedom of opinion and expression.”
In the House, Dorsey faced harsher comments from some lawmakers including Republican Billy Long of Missouri, who complained that his “personalized” feed was dominated by news from sources he disagreed with.
“They’re all pretty much Trump-bashing,” Long said of the recommended articles. But Democrat Paul Tonko of New York expressed dismay “that our Republican colleaues have called this hearing to rile up their base and give credence to unsupported conspiracies.”
Trump stepped up his criticism of social media in an interview with the right-wing Daily Caller, saying the companies “were all on Hillary Clinton’s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it.” Outside the Senate hearing, right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones criticized tech firms for curbing his social media efforts.
Jones, whose Infowars site has been praised by Trump, denounced what he called “a plan to deplatform conservatives, just like communist China,” adding, “this is dangerous, authoritarianism.” (AGENCIES)

Find a Doctor or Dentist
It's important to have a good relationship with your doctor, and it's doubly important to select the right one. Word of mouth is a great way to find a doctor you can trust, but if you're new to an area or would like to do additional research, there are Web sites that can help you find a doctor or dentist.
Insights for Finding a Doctor or Dentist
Don't wait until you have a medical crisis to start looking for a doctor. Here are some tips for choosing a doctor.
If you're looking for a family doctor, follow these guidelines set by the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Check with your insurance provider to learn which doctors in your area accept your plan. Most insurance companies’ Web sites have searchable databases of doctors in their networks.
Top Sites for Finding a Doctor or Dentist
To find a doctor in your area …
American Medical Association allows users to search for information on area doctors by inputting their name and location, or their specialty and location. The database contains a list of more than 800,000 doctors. Additional information on education history, accepted insurance providers and contact information is provided for AMA member physicians.
go to site »
WebMD's physician directory is searchable by location, name and specialty. It contains a specialist glossary to assist those not familiar with technical terminology. The information provided is generally quite extensive, but varies from doctor to doctor.
go to site »
DoctorDirectory.com is a comprehensive directory that narrows down your search by specialty and location. Other services include a hospital finder, a health plan finder and a medical school finder.
go to site »
Medicare's physician directory contains names, addresses, phone numbers, specialties and other important information for Medicare-participating physicians who have agreed to accept assignment on all Medicare claims and covered services. Assignment only works with the Original Medicare Plan. It does not apply if you are in a Medicare managed care plan or Private Fee-For-Service plan. It is important to note that this directory does not include physicians who do not participate with Medicare, as nonparticipating physicians may take assignment on a case-by-case basis, or may never take assignment.
go to site »
For a dentist near you …
1-800-DENTIST has a four-step process for finding a dentist: state your location and dental preferences, select an office, confirm your profile and review the details of the dentist and office. The expanded information on the dentists and their practices—which include hours, credentials, treatments offered and conveniences—are a nice touch.
go to site »
American Dental Association is the largest dental association in the United States, with more than 150,000 members. This feature allows users to search specifically for ADA-member dentists in their area. It provides a glossary to help those unfamiliar with dental terminology determine what specialist suits their needs.
go to site »
Know Your Teeth, a Web site of the Academy of General Dentistry, allows users to search for AGD-member dentists in their area. Keep in mind that dentists listed only practice general dentistry.
go to site »
Dentists.com has an easy-to-use database of more than 100,000 dentists, making it simple to locate a dentist near you.

My first gut reaction was “well that’s nothing new…” I was frankly kind of disappointed. BUT after watching it five more times on my big screen I got a little bit more of a feel for it. So it looks like what we’ve got so far is simply this. It’s 30 years after the battle of Endor and there is a faction(?) of the empire called the First order. (We don’t know if the empire has just been rebranded or if it’s a radicle sect of the empire) and apparently the feats of Luke Skywalker have faded into legend. Rey asks something to the effect “we’ve heard the stories” to which Han replies “their true, all of them, the dark side, the Jedi.”
So apparently we’ve gone from bad to worst! lol Luke didn’t take on a Padawan and has probably gone into hiding like Ben Kenobi and Yoda (they never learn). So here we are 30 years later with a Vader fanboy a.k.a “Kylo Ren” which is not his actual name. Ren is a title from the Knights of Ren. Which is not a sith group but obviously has dark side ties. So the dark side has been working overtime.. While little old Luke is meditating in a tree somewhere.. I personally have a hard time with that. But.. I will live. BUT WAIT! Finn, the disillusioned storm trooper gone rebel is wielding Anikan’s old saber which Luke lost on Bespin along with his hand. So is Finn a Jedi? Seems pretty quick to go from storm trooper who can’t hit the broad side of a barn (nerds are tracking with that one) goes to battling Kylo in a lightsaber duel.
I need some context I guess.. Is Luke training Finn. Is Finn just holding onto it for Luke and happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time?
I don’t know.
BUT! I know that JJ intentionally pissed me off by not giving anything away that was that important. I had my heart set on a “HOLY CRAP I did not see that coming and I’m so excited” moment, but was left with “well I would’ve predicted that, and I did.” Feeling.
Plot line aside. I was a little troubled by the polished non gritty effects. Looked kind of prequels but I’ll reserve further judgement. All I know is JJ has been ranting about practical effects so JJ you better deliver homey.
In closing.. Star Wars is my baby. As a kid, Star Wars was my life. When it snowed I brandished my Han Solo blaster replica and went outside to battle snow troopers on the planet Hoth. Star Wars is more than a movie to me. It brings me back to feeling like a kid. Feelings of being caught up in the wonder of imagination and endless galaxies filled with adventure.
So don’t screw this up JJ. Or you will be forever dubbed Jar Jar Abrams.
May the force be with us all,
– Max

People without homes shouldn’t be without hope
August 6, 2012
The NSW Greens spokesperson for Housing and Homelessness, Jan Barham MLC, is calling on the State Government to demonstrate their commitment to people across the State who find themselves homeless.
The call comes as National Homeless Person’s week is marked across the country.
“This week we will be reminded that approximately 30,000 people in NSW are considered homeless” said Jan Barham. “That’s 30,000 people spending tonight without a bed and without a home.”
“The reality is that people find themselves in this position for a whole host of reasons – they may have been rejected from their family home, have mental health issues, be fleeing domestic violence or dealing with addiction or they may just suddenly find themselves in financial trouble, unable to cope with the increasing cost of living.”
“Whatever the reason for someone becoming homeless, it’s up to all of us as a responsible and caring society to ensure there is support and help available. I am presenting a motion to the Parliament seeking a Government commitment to increase the delivery of support for these vulnerable people.”
The motion will be presented when Parliament resumes next week, calling for a range of initiatives including that:
the Premier’s Advisory Council on Homelessness be retained and meet regularly;
all Councils to have a nominated staff member responsible for ensuring their Council adheres to the Homeless Persons Protocol;
all Councils to be required to report on local initiatives for addressing homelessness in their Local Government Area in their Annual Report;
the 10 Regional Homeless Action Plans developed in July 2010 be reviewed;
the balance of funds from the NSW allocation under the 2009-10 National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness be identified for a funding program to support local government to meet the needs of homeless people;
“I believe there is a stronger role for local councils to play in the provision of services” said Jan. “They know the local problems and they know the local solutions. I’m encouraging the State to work more closely with local government to allow them to be part of the solution, working with non government organisations – but only with adequate support and funding from the State. There is a role for the Government in providing a funding source to local communities to assist in supporting those who find themselves without a home and desperately in need of access to services and support.”

National Homeless Person’s Week 2012 runs from August 6th – 12th and more information can be found at www.HomelessnessAustralia.org.au

Have Your Say on Boarding House reform!
August 6, 2012
The NSW Greens spokesperson for Housing, Jan Barham MLC is calling on the public to lodge submissions as part of the Government’s consultation on reforms to the Boarding House Sector. In June, the Government released an Exposure Draft Boarding Houses Bill 2012 and a position paper.
The Bill proposes a new legislative framework that aims to protect vulnerable residents and comes after calls from the NSW Greens and advocacy groups for reform to the sector. The situation with boarding houses that accommodate people with disabilities is desperately in need of reform as there is a history of abuses. The lack of a state wide register of premises has made it difficult to monitor the performance of the premises and this is addressed in the new proposal.
A new scheme of occupancy rights for residents is provided and an increase in penalties for offences, criminal checks for staff and provisions that allow authorised advocates to enter premises.
Jan Barham welcomes the changes proposed by the Government but has raised some areas that could be strengthened.
“This Exposure Bill comes after numerous distressing reports from the Ombudsman about abuses and lack of regulation and oversight in the Boarding House Sector” said Jan Barham.
“The changes being proposed will tighten up the processes that oversee how the sector is run and will lead to improvements in the quality of life and rights for those in our community that live in boarding houses. There is however a need to strengthen the requirements for in the proposal to ensure coverage of premises that provide occupancy agreements and that greater oversight by government agencies to protect the rights of residents, particularly those with disabilities”
“The rights of vulnerable members of society are able to strengthened with this new legislation.

Have Your Say on Boarding House Reform
August 3, 2012
The NSW Government has released an Exposure Draft Boarding Houses Bill 2012 for discussion. The Bill aims to protect vulnerable residents and comes after calls from the NSW Greens and advocacy groups for reform to the sector and distressing reports from the Ombudsman about abuses and lack of regulation and oversight.
The Bill proposes a new legislative framework that aims to protect vulnerable residents and comes after calls from the NSW Greens and advocacy groups for reform to the sector. The situation with boarding houses that accommodate people with disabilities is desperately in need of reform as there is a history of abuses. The lack of a state wide register of premises has made it difficult to monitor the performance of the premises and this is addressed in the new proposal. A new scheme of occupancy rights for residents is provided and an increase in penalties for offences, criminal checks for staff and provisions that allow authorised advocates to enter premises.
Below is a Briefing Paper that outlines some of the key aspects of the Bill. A Submission Guide is also provided for those who would like to formally respond to the Government.
Submissions are due by Friday August 10th.

Child Protection Legislation Amendment Bill
March 27, 2014
Child Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 2013, Legislative Council Hansard, 26 March 2014
The Hon. JAN BARHAM [6.28 p.m.]: On behalf of The Greens to speak on the Child Protection Legislation Amendment Bill. I indicate at the outset that The Greens hold serious concerns about the approach taken by some of the key reforms proposed in this bill. I believe it must be amended to ensure it will address the best interests of children and young people in this State. It is beyond doubt that there is a desperate need to do more to look after the wellbeing and safety of children in New South Wales. The statistics from our child protection system are nothing short of alarming. There are more than 18,000 children in out-of-home care in New South Wales, making up almost half of the total number of children in care across Australia and giving us the second-highest rate of out-of-home care placement behind the Northern Territory. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are severely over-represented in child protection. More than one-third of the children and young people in out-of-home care in New South Wales were identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and the rate of out-of-home-care placement, at 83.7 children per 1,000, is nearly 12 times higher than the rate for non-Aboriginal children and young people.
The high rate of children placed in out-of-home care in this State is not a new problem, but it continues to worsen. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that at 30 June 2002, New South Wales had 8,084 children in out-of-home care, a rate of five per thousand. By 2008, that had risen to 13,566 and a rate of 8.4 per thousand. At 30 June 2012, the figures were 17,192 and 10.5 per thousand. The rate of children and young people in out-of-home care more than doubled in that decade. I take this opportunity to read from the executive summary of the report of the Special Commission of Inquiry into Child Protection Services in New South Wales 2008. It said:
The key principles which underpin the Inquiry’s reforms are as follows. Child protection is the collective responsibility of the whole of government and of the community. Primary responsibility for rearing and supporting children and young people should rest with families and communities, and with government providing support where it is needed, either directly or through the funded non-government sector.
It went on to say:
The child protection system should comprise integrated universal, secondary and tertiary services, with universal services comprising the greater proportion. They should be delivered by a mixture of the non-government sector and state agencies, with DoCS being a provider of last resort.
Many of the failures of our child protection system were highlighted by the Wood special commission of inquiry, which reported in late 2008. Since those findings, both the Labor and Coalition governments have introduced a range of policy reforms and new programs in an effort to address the challenge of improving child protection and preventing abuse and neglect. The Keep Them Safe action plan is now approaching the end of its five-year term. The National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children commenced at the same time, in 2009, and is into the second of its three-year action plans. The commitment of State and Federal governments of all persuasions to attempt to improve safety for children is not in doubt, but clearly we need to do more, and we need to understand how to do it right.
The national framework, along with the comments of many experts and those working in the sector, make clear that we need a much greater focus on investing in prevention. From a public health perspective, putting far greater emphasis on primary and secondary services is crucial to reduce the numbers in the child protection system and deliver improved outcomes. These services include the universal supports, to assist all families, and the targeted supports, to prevent those who are in disadvantaged and at-risk groups from reaching crisis point. Unfortunately, these investments, which would help to break intergenerational problems and improve wellbeing, are the sorts of long-term strategies that are too often swept aside by governments dealing with the pressures of a three-year budget cycle and media pressure over current failings at the tertiary end of the system. They are also, to a large extent, beyond the statutory part of the child protection system and cannot be addressed within the bill before us today. However, I note that the interests of this State’s children and young people, and the future demands on many of our community, justice and health services, rely on governments making the commitment to take that long-term focus and begin doing much more to deliver prevention and early support services across our cities and regions.
The Child Protection Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to introduce some additional steps to prevent the placement of children in out-of-home care through the introduction of new parent capacity orders and reforms to the current provisions for parent responsibility contracts, which have rarely been used because of the legal risks they expose parents to. Any efforts to create possibilities that head off the move toward child removal and placement in out-of-home care deserve consideration. If we can deliver appropriate, targeted support services to help parents to address risk factors and become able to provide a safe home for their children then we should absolutely do so.
Unfortunately, at present the provisions in the bill create the orders and contracts and provide that they place obligations on the parents to undertake treatment, drug testing or other interventions, but they do not give enough certainty that the supports and services these parents need will be delivered. In introducing the bill the Minister announced that some additional funding—$35 million—would be provided to support the rollout of these reforms, including the provision of more early intervention services. This is a small, positive step, but the allocation of overall funding does not guarantee that parents will get the specific support they require to improve the safety and wellbeing of their family. The bill does not provide for their situation to be prioritised.
We know that there can often be waiting times to access services. In regional areas there may be difficulties with the availability and location of services. The services also need to be suited and appropriate to the needs of the parent. If we are unable to ensure adequate and appropriate service delivery then any contracts or orders will be setting parents up to fail. When they do not meet the requirements placed on them—no matter what the reasons might be—they risk being placed in a situation of seeing their children removed. I recently sat on the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 2 inquiry into drug and alcohol treatment, which heard about the delays and lack of services. There are not enough services available and it appears that there is a lack of recognition of the time it may take for someone to recover from substance abuse. The UnitingCare submission to that inquiry, dated 21 March 2013, said:
Research undertaken by UnitingCare CYPF in 2012 indicated a significant shortage of beds available to women with children who require residential drug and alcohol treatment in NSW. In November 2012, fewer than 100 beds were available to women with children who required such a service, and all of the services reported long wait-lists. Many of the services will not allow teenage boys to stay with their mothers, and very few residential drug and alcohol services existed for single men with children. Availability of appropriate crisis services such as these is essential for tackling underlying causes of neglect.
Submissions on the Child Protection Legislative Reforms Discussion Paper, which the Government released in late 2012 and which provided the basis for the bill before us, highlighted the concerns about service delivery. The Greens will move amendments to improve the bill’s framework, to assure service delivery. I acknowledge that the Hon. Penny Sharpe has also foreshadowed that the Opposition will be moving amendments. The Greens amendments will require that any contracts or orders must provide clarity and detail about the services that the parent is expected to engage with, the time frames and other details involved and, importantly, any assistance that will be provided by Community Services or by non-government agencies to help to ensure that the parent has every possible opportunity to address the issues affecting the safety of their family. We regard these as crucial to ensuring that the efforts to prevent removal by delivering earlier forms of intervention will be effective.
Although the focus on delivering services aimed at preventing the need for out-of-home care placement is welcome—and we believe that it can be made effective through our proposed amendments—the bill’s proposals to modify the framework for permanency planning are more troubling. In particular, in her comments in the Parliament and in the media, the Minister has emphasised her plan to increase the rates of adoption of children from out-of-home care, an approach that has led the Premier to label these reforms as “radical”. This increase in adoption is to be achieved by creating a hierarchy of options to be considered when deciding on which permanent placement choice to pursue for each child in out-of-home care. It begins with family restoration and proceeds to family or kinship guardianship, after which adoption becomes the preferred option.
The Greens do not support the pursuit of adoption as a solution to the challenges facing the child protection system and consider it an inappropriate and ineffective way to ensure the wellbeing of children who have been placed in out-of-home care. The inclusion of adoption as part of a standard decision-making framework, to be applied in all cases where it has been decided that restoration of a child to their parent is not realistic, risks permanently removing the legal relationship and connection between parent and child in a way that may be unnecessary and against the best interests of the child. Many submissions to the Government’s Child Protection Legislative Reform Discussion Paper, which proposed not only this move to promote adoption but also included proposals to allow greater capacity to dispense with consent and even to remove a parent’s right to be informed of a proposed adoption from out-of-home care, highlighted that adoption may be appropriate in some cases but that this must be decided based on the individual circumstances and with careful consideration.
There are a number of reasons that promoting adoption as a general principle is inappropriate within child protection. The evidence does not clearly establish that adoption itself produces better outcomes. The quality and stability of placements are important. These need to be addressed in the foster care system, through improved management and resourcing, and could be addressed via options such as well-supported guardianship. Associate Professor Judy Cashmore stated in her paper entitled “What can we learn from the US experience on permanency planning?”:
As Lahti found, the well-being of children in adoptive homes, in foster care or returned home was related to their sense of permanence in the placement, not to their legal status.
I heard in a number of speeches in this place and the other place reference to evidence about adoption being better than stable, secure and permanent placement. That just is not true. The evidence is not there. The submission by the Council of Social Service of New South Wales [NCOSS] on the child protection legislative reform discussion paper emphasised the importance of stability as a principal consideration that is not as simple as preferring one form of placement to another. The submission states:
NCOSS notes that data shows that children under the care of the Minister are more likely to have multiple placements and therefore poorer wellbeing outcomes than their peers. NCOSS does not support the argument that this is an inherent feature of such care and would argue that efforts can, and should, be made to improve stability in placement in such care arrangements. In other words, NCOSS advocates that across all forms of care, steps must be taken to improve stability of placements. NCOSS is therefore not convinced that the proposed hierarchy of placement is necessary and that decision should be made based on the best interests of the child or young person in their particular circumstances and context.
We must also recognise that adoption placements, particularly with children affected by a history of abuse or neglect, can break down in the same way as other placements. Associate Professor Judy Cashmore also noted:
“[Adoption] needs to be carefully considered because, as noted earlier, adoptions can also break down, and at rates that are not markedly different from long-term foster care when the age at which children are placed is taken into account.”
Other submissions on the Government’s discussion paper raised concerns about a range of risks and potential legal complications that arise when adoption is part of a standard permanency planning process. These include that children may be cleared for adoption, but without adoptive parents being available. The UnitingCare submission noted:
One such consequence is the possible creation of a pool of “adoption orphans” – children who have adoption orders but do not have any prospective adoptive parents. A review of research from the US by Judy Cashmore … describes the likely negative psychological impact of being an “adoption orphan”:
Being ‘freed ‘for adoption but ‘not chosen’ is perhaps one of the worst possible outcomes for children; it leaves them in limbo without a legal parent and is more likely to undermine rather than increase any sense of permanence or security for these children.
Others, including Legal Aid NSW, warned that the elevated prospect of adoption could increase contested legal matters, which would undermine the efforts in other parts of the bill to promote alternative dispute resolution and constructive engagement to address risk factors. Ongoing support of adopted families and the impact of increased involvement in adoption evaluations for the child welfare sector also were raised in submissions. I note with concern that this Government previously reduced funding that is provided to support families who adopt from out-of-home care. Given that, as I already have noted above, the issues of stability in placement breakdown are not as distinct from other forms of care placement as the reforms seem to presume. The funding and support issues are further reasons for concern about negative impacts for the promotion of adoption in this bill. This submission from the Benevolent Society states:
In relation to long-term guardianship orders and adoption, it is essential that ongoing financial and practical supports are available so that children and young people have access to opportunities that promotes their social and emotional development as well as services to address the often complex needs.
If the proposed hierarchy is adopted, the elevation of adoption means that non-government out-of-home care service providers will increasingly play a role in adoption. To do so they must be trained and resourced accordingly, including being able to access legal advice.
In short, adoption must be considered with extreme caution based on the circumstances of each individual case. Implementing a legislative requirement that the director general consider adoption whenever restoration has been deemed unrealistic, along with including it in a standardised hierarchy for decision-making, undermines the capacity to give adoption this necessary case-by-case consideration. When we are talking about such a permanent and irrevocable step as adoption, this is unacceptable. Referring to question 12 in the discussion paper, the UnitingCare submission states:
The Adoption Act 2010 (NSW) is underpinned by the principles of open adoption and capacity for contact with birth families in an attempt to prevent the tragic impacts of adoptions policies that led to the Stolen Generation and the forced adoptions. Because of the profound effects of poor public policy in adoption, UnitingCare CYPF advises caution in relation to objectives to “fast-track” and/or “relax” requirements of adoption legislation and policy.
Internationally, the move to fast-track adoptions has in some cases created hurried, poorly-matched placements resulting in poorer outcomes and adoption breakdowns.
I certainly hope that in 10 years time whoever is in this Parliament is not having a sad debate about how this could have happened and making yet another apology. There is no argument that timely decision-making about permanency planning and care arrangements are an important aim. It is a crucial part of managing out-of-home care casework to pursue and ensure stability in the care arrangements of a child while, whenever possible, seeking to address risk factors and promote permanency. However, there also needs to be flexibility to recognise that change can take time, progress may not always go without interruption or setbacks, and that a crucial part of case management is recognising that sometimes a quick decision may not turn out to be the right decision.
Although the bill offers the court some discretion to extend this time frame, The Greens maintain—as did a number of submissions to the child protection legislative reform discussion paper—that determining the time frame for permanency planning decisions, particularly for considering the possibility of deciding that restoration is no longer a realistic possibility, is a matter for policy and casework rather than something that should be fixed in legislation. The existing Community Services policy aims to meet the time frames this legislation would introduce to the Act. This is where they should remain. The bill includes a range of other provisions that will change the way our child protection system operates. Some, such as the increased focus on alternative dispute resolution processes like family group conferencing, offer promise for a system that engages parents in a constructive effort to head off risk and develop a path towards a better parenting capacity, safer families and improved wellbeing. The effectiveness of these approaches will depend on the Government delivering the framework, the resources and the funding to genuinely support at-risk families.
In launching this bill the Government labelled it as aiming to provide children with “a safe, stable home for life”. Presented in isolation and repeated as a slogan, it seems hard to fault this as a principle. But as is often the case, when we discuss what is in the best interests of children and young people we find that equally valid principles can come into conflict with one another. Children should have the opportunity to build and maintain a connection with their family to the extent to which they are able. Moving to rapidly sever relationships through adoption—albeit a process of “open adoption” that allows some contact—undermines this opportunity. I read with interest that in 2001, at the time when adoption was being proposed by the current Opposition and then Government, Mr Hazzard, the member for Wakehurst, raised the idea that the best interest of the child should not exclude the very important issue and essential principle of children’s interests being part of a continuum. He referred to a report and stated:
… all reasonable efforts should be made to preserve and unify families but where this isn’t appropriate all reasonable efforts should be made to place the child in permanent care.
Children should not be subjected to neglect and abuse. Too often that is a product of an intergenerational cycle in which disadvantage and lack of capacity pass on the most terrible harms and the worst lessons to the parents of the future. Sadly, we see all governments doing too little about this important and obvious issue.

What Do Your Taxes Pay For?
Tip: Mid May. If the government had raised taxes enough to cover federal borrowing, we would have had to work until May 6 just to cover the tax bill.
Source: Tax Foundation, 2018
Taxes are one of the biggest budget items for most taxpayers, yet many have no idea what they’re getting for their money.
In 2017, as in recent years, Americans spent more on taxes than on groceries, clothing, and shelter combined. In fact, we worked until late April just to earn enough money to pay our taxes. So what do all those weeks of work get us?1
Fast Fact: In the Hole. In fiscal 2018, the federal government will spend $804 billion more than it collects in revenue. The government borrows the funds it needs to cover this shortfall by selling Treasury securities and savings bonds.
Source: Congressional Budget Office, 2018
The accompanying chart breaks down the $3.95 trillion in federal spending for 2017 into major categories. By far, the biggest category is Social Security, which consumes one-fourth of the budget. Income security, which includes food assistance and unemployment compensation, takes another 13%. Defense and related items take 15% of the budget, and 28% goes to Medicare and health programs.2

They never fired her. She left on her own. Unbelievable to me.
If you fire a woman these days, you're a misogynist. So we end up with more people who are crap at their job.
It wasn't quite that bad back in the day, at least out here. I think the manager or managers at the time were just people-loving softies. Honestly, it wasn't the worst thing in the world, I suppose. Where I am now we had an extremely entitled guy come over from Apple. He claimed to be a front end developer, but he literally never checked in anything to Github in two weeks. He was asked to fix some Windows display issues and was totally helpless. His boss asked me to take the machine I use for Windows automation and let him use it to fix the error because getting a VM going was beyond him. I did so.
Dude needed me to help him TURN IT ON. As in hit the power button. He was on a contract, didn't do a dot of work in two weeks, was away from his desk for hours at a time, got a heads-up that we needed more productivity, did nothing to change it and was let go.

It wasn't quite that bad back in the day, at least out here. I think the manager or managers at the time were just people-loving softies. Honestly, it wasn't the worst thing in the world, I suppose. Where I am now we had an extremely entitled guy come over from Apple. He claimed to be a front end developer, but he literally never checked in anything to Github in two weeks. He was asked to fix some Windows display issues and was totally helpless. His boss asked me to take the machine I use for Windows automation and let him use it to fix the error because getting a VM going was beyond him. I did so.
Dude needed me to help him TURN IT ON. As in hit the power button. He was on a contract, didn't do a dot of work in two weeks, was away from his desk for hours at a time, got a heads-up that we needed more productivity, did nothing to change it and was let go. Actually, now that I type it all out that's not that place being harsh, but realistic.

As part of his announcement, President Trump announced that this will not affect his plan to attract and retain the best and brightest employees. That's bull. I know several government employees who have left federal service due to low pay compared to comparable civilian jobs.
Yeah this reminds me of a conversation I had with my mom when I came home from community college complaining about my teachers. Basically "Well if they were really good at what they were teaching.. they wouldn't be teaching in community college."
My experience was a bit different. The best teachers I had were at Syracuse, sure, but they also had by faaaaaar the worst.
It is apparently completely acceptable at a university that some are paying $20 grand a year to for instructors to speak with the thickest accents of all time, to the point where class is a thing you attend for social reasons, and then all the kids get to try to teach themselves. You wouldn't put up with it if you were making a radio ad for the university, but to teach kids? No prob.
Never had that problem in community college. There was actually a lot I liked about community college. I was still bad at it, but at least it was 100% my fault there.

It should be noted that there are a lot of jobs in the private sector for what we do where pace is a crawl, there's no accountability and it's impossible to get fired. I worked with a person a few years ago that was never cut out to program. There were days where she actively made things worse due to some stupid idea she had. You couldn't tell her anything, either, without her getting offended.
They never fired her. She left on her own. Unbelievable to me.

I could, and have considered it. I could list a dozen examples, but bottom line is I'm not sure I could re-acclimate to the pace and expectations of the private sector IT jobs at this point. I'm a little over a decade away from retirement so my current plan is to ride this ship out.

As corny as it might sound, most of the people I work with really do care about aviation safety, and it's something we're reminded of from time to time in the office culture. Our already lean budget's been cut, and now with no raises on the horizon, I think people are just trying to do their best with what they have to work with and pray/hope nothing happens on their watch.

A lot of people also work for the government because it's virtually impossible to get fired. That was the case a while back, Flack can correct me if that has changed.
Oh, absolutely true -- although Trump is actively trying to change that. But yeah, anyone who has ever seen a mailman bowl a package down the sidewalk toward their house knows that not all federal employees graduated at the top of their class. Partially because of unions and partially because legendary government paperwork, it's a lot easier to transfer (and/or promote) an employee than it is to terminate one.

Doing some loose math here.
Google reports that there are currently approximately 2 million federal civilian employees. It also says that the average salary of a government employee is $88,809. (Seems high, but we'll go with it.) That comes out to $177,618,000,000, or 177 billion dollars. 2.1% of that number is $3,729,978,000.
$4 billion sounds like a lot of money, but you have to look at it in scope. The federal budget for next year is 4.4 trillion dollars. ($4,400,000,000,000.) Dealing in millions and even billions isn't a shocking number. One of the first things Donald Trump did after being elected was buy 90 jets from Lockheed Martin for $8.5 billion. An internal report from the Department of Homeland Security has placed the cost of Donald Trump's nonsensical border wall at $26 billion (a low estimate according to most insiders). According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will add roughly a trillion dollars to the federal debt over the next ten years. So while $4 billion may sound like a lot of money in salary increases, in the big picture, it's a pretty small capitol hill of beans.

A little explanation for RealNC, whom I suspect may not fully understand the issue.
I'm not exactly sure where to start. Each year, the cost of "things" (food, rent, and services) increase due to inflation. The US Department of Labor (among others) track these increases. The difference (typically an increase) between two dates is known as a cost of living difference. According to the Department of Labor's website, the cost of living adjustment between July 2018 and July 2018 is approximately 3% (link). That means that, on average, things cost 3% more this year than they did least year. That also means that unless your salary has increased over the past year by 3% or more, you are essentially making less money than you were last year due to inflation.
Something you may or may not know is that most federal civilian workers (such as myself) no longer get performance based pay raises. (If you really want, I can go into the details in regards to GS vs. FG vs. Core Comp pay bands.) In the past, most federal workers received a yearly "step" increase, but that no longer happens. The way it works now is, whatever salary you start with is essentially the salary you'll have as long as you're in that same position. Today, the only standard raise most federal employees get on a yearly basis is the relatively paltry cost of living increase. So even though the cost of living has gone up 3% since last year, federal employees were only set to get a 2.1% increase. And now we're getting a 0% increase.
As part of his announcement, President Trump announced that this will not affect his plan to attract and retain the best and brightest employees. That's bull. I know several government employees who have left federal service due to low pay compared to comparable civilian jobs. When I was working in security, the kid I trained left for a position that paid 2 1/2x what I was making. Most of the people I know that still work for the government do so because of benefits, retirement, or a sense of dedication and/or loyalty to our country, not because they're getting rich. It's already difficult to attract the "best and brightest" when civilian jobs pay so much more, but when they see things like "oh and the president might cancel your raise on a whim," forget about it.
At this point, my co-workers and I are essentially in survival mode, hoping to make it until 2020 and come up for air then, hoping the damage that's been done isn't permanent.

What Do Your Taxes Pay For?
Tip: Mid May. If the government had raised taxes enough to cover federal borrowing, we would have had to work until May 6 just to cover the tax bill.
Source: Tax Foundation, 2018
Taxes are one of the biggest budget items for most taxpayers, yet many have no idea what they’re getting for their money.
In 2017, as in recent years, Americans spent more on taxes than on groceries, clothing, and shelter combined. In fact, we worked until late April just to earn enough money to pay our taxes. So what do all those weeks of work get us?1
Fast Fact: In the Hole. In fiscal 2018, the federal government will spend $804 billion more than it collects in revenue. The government borrows the funds it needs to cover this shortfall by selling Treasury securities and savings bonds.
Source: Congressional Budget Office, 2018
The accompanying chart breaks down the $3.95 trillion in federal spending for 2017 into major categories. By far, the biggest category is Social Security, which consumes one-fourth of the budget. Income security, which includes food assistance and unemployment compensation, takes another 13%. Defense and related items take 15% of the budget, and 28% goes to Medicare and health programs.2
Are taxes one of your biggest budget items? Take steps to make sure you’re managing your overall tax bill. Please consult a tax professional for specific information regarding your individual situation.

Warming set to breach 1C threshold
November 9, 2015, 6:48pm
Global temperatures reached high levels in 2014 but 2015 is expected to be the warmest since records began. Picture Noaa
By Matt McGrath, BBC News
Global temperatures are set to rise more than one degree above pre-industrial levels according to the UK's Met Office. Figures from January to September this year are already 1.02C above the average between 1850 and 1900.
If temperatures remain as predicted, 2015 will be the first year to breach this key threshold.
The world would then be half way towards 2C, the gateway to dangerous warming. The new data is certain to add urgency to political negotiations in Paris later this month aimed at securing a new global climate treaty.
Difficult to measure
For researchers, confusion about the true level of temperatures in the 1750s, when the industrial revolution began and fossil fuels became widely used, means that an accurate assessment of the amount the world has warmed since then is very difficult.
To get over this problem, the Met Office use an average of the temperatures recorded between 1850 and 1900, which they argue makes their analysis more accurate.
Their latest temperature information comes from a dataset jointly run by the Met Office and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.
The HadCRUT database showed that in the first nine months of this year, the global mean temperature had just gone above 1C, hitting 1.02 with a error factor of plus or minus 0.11C. Scientists say that the one degree mark will be broken in 2015 because of a combination of carbon emissions and the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon.
"We have seen a strong El Nino develop in the Tropical Pacific this year and that will have had some impact on this year's global temperature," said Stephen Belcher, director of the Met Office Hadley Centre.
"We've had similar natural events in the past, yet this is the first time we're set to reach the 1C marker and it's clear that it is human influence driving our modern climate into uncharted territory."
In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that the combined land and ocean temperature showed warming of 0.85C between 1880 and 2012.
They also noted that the difference in the average temperatures from the 1850 to 1900 period was 0.78C when compared to the average between 2003 and 2012.
In other climate-related developments:
The World Meteorological Organization - the UN's weather agency - says levels of carbon dioxide and methane, two key greenhouse gases, reached record highs last year
A World Bank report says that 62 million more people in South Asia could fall into extreme poverty by 2030 as a result of lower crop yields and higher food prices, and the health impacts of climate change.
New normal
Since 2013, warming of the oceans and land surfaces has reached new heights. The year 2014 went down as the warmest year since records began, but it is likely that 2015 will go beyond that level. Scientists believe that 2016 is also shaping up as a very warm year and they expect that the one degree margin will become more firmly established in the coming years.
"This year marks an important first but that doesn't necessarily mean every year from now on will be a degree or more above pre-industrial levels, as natural variability will still play a role in determining the temperature in any given year," said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution, at the Met Office.
"As the world continues to warm in the coming decades, however, we will see more and more years passing the one degree marker - eventually it will become the norm."
Other researchers in the field say that while the 1C threshold is significant, the overall direction of travel is far more important. "What matters is this background warming that continues up," said Prof Miles Allen from the University of Oxford.
"And whether we have a wobble that takes us to 1.02 or 0.99, ok it matters in a sporting event, but it doesn't really matter in terms of global mean temperature."
The development is likely to increase pressure on politicians to reach a decisive agreement at the UN climate conference in Paris later this month.
After the failure of the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, political leaders agreed the following year in Cancun that two degrees of warming would be the agreed mark beyond which temperatures should not rise.
Many island states disagree with the two degree goal and want the UN to adopt a lower threshold of 1.5C.
A UN analysis of the carbon cutting plans put forward by nations ahead of the Paris meeting concluded that, taken together, they would lead to warming of 2.7C above pre-industrial levels.
UK Energy and Climate Secretary Amber Rudd says the latest findings from the Met Office underline the need for a deal in Paris.
"Pledges to reduce emissions made by countries so far represent a significant commitment but that's just the beginning," she said in a statement.
"We need to ensure that as the costs of clean energy fall, countries can be more ambitious with their climate targets."
A brief history of two degrees
The idea of a dangerous warming threshold was first mentioned by Yale economist William Nordhaus in the 1970s. In 1990, the Stockholm Environmental Institute came forward with a more definitive statement that 2C should be taken as the level at which dangerous warming would occur.
However politicians meeting at the Rio summit in 1992 refused to explicitly adopt the target. The first political body to declare that 2C was the goal, was the 1996 European Council of environment ministers, which included a young Angela Merkel as the German representative.
The main UN bodies though were wary of including the target despite the urging of scientists, and it took climate negotiators until 2010 in Cancun to commit their governments to "hold the increase in global average temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels."

Flu risk less on flights if in a window seat finds study

By Dr Ananya Mandal, MDMarch 19, 2018
Airplanes are known to be medium for spreading airborne infections mainly because of the number of people including some with contagious infections such as flu, being clubbed together in a closed space.
Research has shown that risk of getting flu is reduced if a person gets a window seat on an airplane. The study was published yesterday (19th of March 2018) in the latest issue of the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The new study shows that sitting by the window may keep a person away from the infectious people who may be on the aisle or may me moving about the flight. According to lead researcher, Vicki Stover Hertzberg of Emory University in Atlanta, getting a window seat and not moving much during the flight is the best bet to avoid catching flu. This study was funded by Boeing Co. who did not have an influence of the final results said Hertzberg.
For this study the team of researchers moved around the world in transcontinental flights in 2012 and 2013, testing the surfaces of the cabins and its air for the viruses. They also observed how people came into contact with each other during flights. As a next step the team used mathematical models and simulations to check and see how likely it was for people to come close to an infectious person on board. They created a hypothetical infectious patient sitting on the 14th row of a single-aisle airplane for a typical 4 to 5 hours flight. They noted that from this one person, according to mathematical calculations, only one person in 150 would be infected.
They noted that around 38 percent of passengers did not leave their seats during the flight. While 13 percent left their seats at least twice, 11 percent left their seats more than two times. This means that there is a substantial amount of movement in the aisles. Most of the movement came from those sitting on aisle seats, they found. On analysis they noted that movement was most (80 percent) in aisle seats and 62 percent in the middle seats and 43 percent in the window seats respectively. In their mathematical model they noted that 11 people who were sitting closest to the infected person are at greatest risk of getting the infection. This included those sitting on his or her either sides or in front or behind him or her. The risk of giving flu to another was 0.7 additional people for an infected patient, the study found. On the other hand they also performed a simulation where a crew member was similarly infected. They noted that if that was the case, the crew member infected 4.6 persons additionally per flight.
One of the problems with this study was the limited time and number of flights covered. Of the ten flights that they looked at, only one person was coughing. The researchers further could not find any of the different cold and flu viruses on board during their study. More research and a larger sample are necessary to make comments about spread of flu on flights say experts.
According to Emory’s Howard Weiss, who is a co-author, the bottom line is to “practice good hand hygiene, keep your hands away from your face”. In addition is a person is seated at least a meter away from an infected person on flight, they are, “are unlikely to get infected by influenza during an 4 to 5 hour flight.”

"FROM BEHIND BARS" - A Series, Part 23
Photo - CTMirror.org
This is the twenty third in a series of letters written by someone currently in the custody of the Connecticut Department of Correction. (Links to previous letters are at the bottom of the page.)
There are more than 50 letters going back for a number of years. One per day, Monday thru Friday will be published until we catch up to the present day.
Those following this series will observe that they started out rather "slow" and that as time goes by, they become more and more personal, revealing the emotional and physical distresses faced by those committed to Connecticut's prisons. These distresses are not confined (no pun intended) to just the prisoner, but extend to the prisoner's family and friends. And we pay for it.
Most of us likely don't know anyone who is incarcerated, much less do we correspond with someone who is. These letters are being submitted anonymously and have been, and will be, redacted to protect the privacy of the writer and the writer's family and friends.
After examining the trial transcripts and speaking extensively to others who have first hand and intimate knowledge of the matter, I am of the opinion that this person is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, his council being incompetent and ineffective.
Because the purpose of publishing these letters is not to bring condemnation or ridicule to the parties affected, such comments will not be published. Please keep an open mind and take the letters at face value.
Editor
Day 301 (Followers will have picked up that there is more than one person receiving these letters.)
To access this entire series, use the search field at the top of the page. Enter exactly; "FROM BEHIND BARS" - A Series, then click. Then, choose "sort by date".

by Chris Snowbeck on June 15, 2018 in News with Comments Off on 2018 Page One Awards in Newspaper Journalism
Tweet
MNSPJ congratulates all the winners recognized Thursday night at the annual Page One Awards! Here’s a list of winners for excellence in newspaper journalism.
Spot News Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Paul Walsh, Libor Jany, Miguel Otarola, Star Tribune
“Minnehaha Academy Explosion”
Judge’s comment
“Great reporting. The reporters do a nice job putting the reader at the scene of what happened and adding key context — giving a face to the victims and exploring the history of gas leaks in the state. It’s a nice package. The photos are also gripping.
Second Place, Neal Justin, Star Tribune
“Scandal Hits Home”
Third Place, Kristen Leigh Painter, Kavita Kumar, Nicole Norfleet, Star Tribune
“Macy’s sells landmark home of Minneapolis retail”
Meeting/Planned news event Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Nate Gotlieb, Southwest Journal
“School Board votes to rectify ‘wrongful firings’ of seven employees”
Judge’s comment
“This piece clearly meets journalistic standards. The lede clearly and efficiently explains what the story is about. There are multiple sources and the board vote is explained in detail.”
Meeting/Planned news event Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Staff Star Tribune
“Franken resigns”
Judge’s comment
“Well done by the staff of the Star Tribune. The event was covered from multiple angles, with each story being very clear and consistent. Sourcing was phenomenal.”
Second Place, Shannon Prather, Star Tribune
“New St. Paul shelter offer paths out of homelessness”
Third Place, Chris Tomasson, St. Paul Pioneer Press
“Tom Brady leads Patriots to fifth Super Bowl win as Falcons collapse”
Feature Newspaper – LESS than 50,000+ circulation
First Place, John Lundy, Duluth News Tribune
“She taught me how to walk”
Judge’s comment
“Lovely writing. Well-sourced story. Full of great scenes.”
Second Place, Jana Hollingsworth, Duluth News Tribune
“My life mattered”
Third Place, Zac Farber, Minnesota Lawyer
“Politics of the Past: Minnesota’s “Wild Woman” charged with impersonating a man in 1858”
Feature Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Mila Koumpilova, Star Tribune
“Mohamed in the middle”
Judge’s comment
“Wonderful storytelling. Puts a face on a young immigrant trying to navigate his way to college.”
Second Place, Susan Du, City Pages
“An underground club is raided, and Minneapolis must face the times”
Third Place, S. M. Chavey, Pioneer Press
“After a fall, Twin Cities woman forgot her entire life”
Enterprise/In-Depth (Single story) Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Mark Fischenich, Mankato Free Press
“A Blast Gone Bad”
Judge’s comment
“Great in-depth reporting that tells a really interesting story and does a solid job explaining what happened.”
Second Place, Brian Johnson, Finance & Commerce
“Investors cut back on affordable-housing tax credits”
Third Place, Melinda Lavine, Duluth News Tribune
“You’re not a fraud”
Enterprise/In-Depth (Single story) Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Jean Hopfensperger, Star Tribune
“A new reformation”
Judge’s comment
“This could have been a mundane story–500 years since Martin Luther made religious history. Instead, the reader is taken to Europe to see a pilgrimage of locals seeing where it all happened. Very interesting and entertaining read.”
Second Place, Tad Vezner, Pioneer Press
“Businesses facing ADA lawsuits”
Third Place, Pam Louwagie, Star Tribune
“Trying to escape shadow of dread”
Enterprise/In-Depth (Series) Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Business Journals’ local and national staff, Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal
“The Amazon Effect: How taxpayers are funding disruption of the U.S. economy”
Judge’s comment
“Amazon offers its customers convenience but at what cost? This fascinating, well researched piece answers that question and it is nothing short of an eye opener.”
Second Place, Dylan Thomas, Michelle Bruch, Eric Best, Nate Gotlieb, Southwest Journal
“Making Change”
Third Place, Mike Longaecker, Michelle Wirth, RiverTown Multimedia
“Public Safety Magnet”
Enterprise/In-Depth (Series) Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Chris Serres, David Joles, Star Tribune
“Left to Suffer”
Judge’s comment
“Left to Suffer” stood head-and-shoulders above the competition. The writing was excellent, clear and focused without being “writerly.” Reporter Chris Seres fully detailed the abuse and its impact, but this sensitive subject matter was never sensationalized, which made it all the more compelling. Stories seamlessly wove the broader systemic failures into the personal stories. David Joles photos were compelling, and the decision to make them black-and-white only emphasized their power. The interactive graphic in the Grayce Braaten case was stunning, and persuading David DeLong to speak was a true “get”. Finally, change- the Heritage House licenses- was triggered by the stories’ findings even before the story published, evidence of having unearthed irrefutable findings. An important story, and the clear category winner.”
Second Place, Kristen Leigh Painter, Glen Stubbe, Star Tribune
“The Future of Food”
Third Place, MaryJo Webster, Anthony Lonetree, Beena Raghavendran, Beatrice Dupuy, Star Tribune
“Students in Flight”
Investigative Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Jana Peterson, Pine Journal
“Police chief suspended”
Judge’s comment
“This is a wonderful example of community journalism — closely following the actions of a public body, challenging that body when it violates open meetings laws, giving context and history to problems with the police department, and following up the resolution with a deep dive into documents underlying the story. The town of Cloquet is obviously well-served by its newspaper.”
Investigative
Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Jennifer Bjorhus, MaryJo Webster, Star Tribune
“Shielded by the Badge”
Judge’s comment
“Journalism at its finest. This powerful data reporting exposed how hundreds of Minnesota law enforcement officers kept their badges despite convictions for violent criminal offenses. The four-part series reveals a state licensing system that is failing the public. Well done!”
Second Place, Susan Du, City Pages
“From wedding to body bag in 12 hours — what happened to Elisa Gomez?”
Business Story Newspaper — LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Nicholas Halter, Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal
“Where have you gone Mr. Holmes?”
Judge’s comment
“A well-reported profile that was hard to put down. The story really brought out the mystery behind Mr. Homes and his real estate business.”
Second Place, Katharine Grayson, Minneapolis St. Paul Business Journal
“Ready for a race?”
Third Place, Matt Johnson, Finance & Commerce
“Perking up an old coffee factory in the North Loop”
Business Story Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Jeff Meitrodt, Star Tribune
“Cost of affair, family rift measured in millions”
Judge’s comment
“This is what business journalism is all about. The reporter peels back the curtain on allegations of misspending by a chief executive at one of Minnesota’s largest privately owned companies and how it has torn the family business apart.”
Second Place, Susan Du, City Pages
“Reefer Riches: What Minnesota could learn about recreational marijuana”
Third Place, Christopher Magan, Pioneer Press
“Liquor’s Sunday shift”
Sports News Story Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Shane Frederick, Mankato Free Press
“Contract shows MSU’s commitment to Hastings”
Judge’s comment
“Fantastic. The reporter used quotes from the sports coach and the president of the university, two very important sources. There’s also a utilization of a public information request. which heavily benefits the story. The combination of data and sourcing combines for an interesting, informational news piece.”
Sports News Story Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Heather Rule, Star Tribune
“Gophers men’s hockey team spreads the wealth in victory over Harvard”
Judge’s comment
“This one stood apart from the rest because, simply, it was a news story. This story has detail, quotations from multiple sources, and gets to the point from the get-go.”
Second Place, Chris Tomasson, St. Paul Pioneer Press
“Ex-Viking Mike Harris upbeat despite congenital brain condition forcing retirement”
Sports Feature Story Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Chris Tomasson, St. Paul Pioneer Press
“Latavius Murray: Late best friend ‘will be looking down’ when he takes field for the Vikings”
Judge’s comment
“A very captivating piece. The lede drew me in and the storytelling had plenty of verve. The quotes tell me that the writer knew to ask the right questions.”
Second Place, Andy Greder, St. Paul Pioneer Press
“It took a village to change the life of Gophers running back Shannon Brooks”
Arts & Entertainment Story Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Sarah Horner, Pioneer Press
“Drug-abuse expert knows how to make meth, and, evidently, meatloaf”
Judge’s comment
“In “A Way of Thinking ‘Outside the Pan,'” Sarah Horner takes us inside Carol Falkowski’s kitchen to watch the former drug-abuse expert sculpt faces out of meatloaf. It’s as ridiculous and hilarious as you’d expect because of Horner’s attention to detail. Horner steers the reader through this cooking adventure masterfully.”
Second Place, Erica Rivera, City Pages
“Man of constant sorrow: Charlie Parr’s quiet battle to stay alive”
Third Place, Susan Du, City Pages
“One Minneapolis lawyer’s neo-Nazi record label, and the fight to shut it down”
Arts Criticism/Reviews Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Dylan Thomas, Southwest Journal
Art Beat
Judge’s comment
“This eloquent piece captures the essence of the artist’s work and their goal of delivering an impactful statement on the dangers of plastic in the environment. Well done!”
Arts Criticism/Reviews
Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Keith Harris, City Pages
“Taylor Swift would very much like to exclude us from her narrative”
Judge’s comment
“Thoughtful article and very fun to read. He does a great job analyzing both Swift and West in a way that was insightful.”
Second Place, Laurie Hertzel, Star Tribune
Third Place, Chris Hewitt, Star Tribune
Column Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Christa Lawler, Duluth News Tribune
“In the kitchen: We found solace, laughter, turkey rollups where the food was”
Judge’s comment
“Lovely descriptive writing and a great reminder that the best food writing is often about so much more than food.”
Second Place, Tim Krohn, Mankato Free Press
“Some good shepherds still around”
Third Place, Robb Murray, Mankato Free Press
“Batter Up: The swing that supercharged a summer”
Column Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Jon Tevlin, Star Tribune
“Giant of Senate is now its ghost”
Judge’s comment
“Tevlin’s thoughtful piece on Franken’s tarnished political career simultaneously rings the alarm on using social media as the sole platform for revealing sexual harassment allegations. Well done!”
Second Place, Mike Mullen, City Pages
“Capitol Crimes: Minnesota’s ‘new normal’ is a mess”
Third Place, Scott Gillespie, Star Tribune
“The trains and buses that bind”
Editorial Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Brian Hunhoff, Yankton County Observer
“Democracy dies behind closed statehouse doors”
Judge’s comment
“Brian Hunhoff’s editorial clearly and compelling lays out what’s at stake when state lawmakers’ insist on secrecy. It hits all the right notes, illustrating what can go on behind closed doors, such as decisions on Medicaid and teachers’ pay.”
Second Place, Chuck Frederick, Duluth News Tribune
“Ending Sex Trafficking”
Third Place, Joe Spear, Mankato Free Press
“Quarry Blast Needs Robust Investigation”
Editorial Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Editorial Board, Star Tribune
“Downtown’s Dilemma”
Judge’s comment
“This is carefully considered editorial, and clearly deserving of this year’s first-place award in the category. It informs as well as opines, and appears to be the product of research and reporting, instead of merely regurgitating what was already in the news and slapping an opinion on it”
Second Place, Patricia Effenberger, Pioneer Press
“Beneath the turmoil: heart and civic muscle”
Graphics/Art and Illustration Newspaper LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Ben Ramsden, Steve Thomas, Dirk DeYoung, Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal
“One of Minnesota’s greatest champions”
Judge’s comment
“It’s not easy making old white businessmen into compelling lead art. It’s also not easy to make business news – as important as it is – clean and clear looking. Here’s how you do that, if anyone else is curious.”
Graphics/Art and Illustration Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Emily Utne, City Pages
“Picked to Click 2017”
Judge’s comment
“The page layout is a clean balance of skilled typography, original photography, and effective overall layout. The design is fairly minimalist, allowing the graphics present to shine without challenging other elements on the page.”
Second Place, Brandon Ferrill, Mark Boswell, Josh Penrod, Derek Simmons, Star Tribune
“Executive Compensation Report”
Third Place, Chrissy Ashack, Star Tribune

“Sink or swim in amenities race,” “Sparkle fading for “starchitects,” “Another tall order for Edina”

“The headlines are concise and to the point. They’re straight ahead and informative. The play on words are clever but not distractingly so, and invite the reader in without overplayed tease”
Second Place, Jeff Sjerven, Finance & Commerce
“Deconstructing buildings, reconstructing lives; Mississippi has inside lane for auto plant”
Third Place, Brian Hunhoff, Yankton County Observer
“Three cheers to Tabor triplets as graduation nears; Opponents flunk Medicaid math; Yankton’s vital signs past and present”
Headlines Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Staff, Star Tribune
Judge’s comment
“The three headlines in this entry from the Star Tribune were pithy, informative and intriguing without being “too cute.” The writers and editors were clearly in synch with the desk on these stories – no small accomplishment for any staff. Congratulations for that, and for these fine headlines!”
Second Place, Catherine Preus, Star Tribune
Third Place, Kevin Cusick, St. Paul Pioneer Press
Best Issue Newspaper – LESS than 50,000 circulation
First Place, Newsroom staff Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal
August 18, 2017 Edition
Judge’s comment
“This is more than just a slick design and a record of business developments. The journalism here matters, and not just to the stereotypical business reader.”
Second Place, Newsroom staff, Mankato Free Press
Jan. 29, 2017 edition
Third Place, Kristal Leebrick, Stephen Parker, Park Bugle
November 2017
Best issue Newspaper – 50,000+ circulation
First Place, Star Tribune staff
Judge’s comment
“In an era where it’s not impossible to imagine Sunday newspapers disappearing just as Sunday magazines did, the Star Tribune does a solid job cover to cover keeping itself relevant – and giving their readers many reasons to get newsprint on their hands on the Lord’s Day, instead of tapping on their phone.”

Trump taps someone else from Fox News for his team (yes, again)
02/07/19 03:47 PM
By Steve Benen
About a year ago, Fox News’ Juan Williams joked on the air that he sees Donald Trump’s White House as a reality-television program – and if you want to make it onto the show, you have to be in a Fox News green room “because apparently that’s the staging area.”
Perhaps he wasn’t kidding.
The Trump administration will tap a former Fox News reporter and former intelligence operative to lead the U.S. government’s premier agency charged with exposing and countering disinformation from Russia and other foreign governments around the world.
Lea Gabrielle, who joined Fox News in 2013 and is also a former Navy pilot, will be the new head of the Global Engagement Center, according to a copy of the announcement obtained by USA TODAY.
The State Department’s Global Engagement Center is a relatively obscure agency, though it made headlines for a good reason last year. The New York Times reported in March 2018 that the center was provided with $120 million to “counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections,” but it hadn’t spent a dime.
It will now be led by Fox News’ Lea Gabrielle, who, as USA Today’s report added, is facing questions from Trump administration critics about “her qualifications for the job.”
Brett Bruen, who worked on the U.S. response to Russian propaganda in the Obama administration, told the newspaper, “Lea may be a great reporter and pilot. She has evidenced absolutely no knowledge of or experience with information warfare. We need leadership that can take on this danger from day one.”
She will, however, find plenty of other folks on Team Trump who’ve made the transition from the president’s television screen to his administration’s staff.
Just two months ago, for example, Trump tapped Heather Nauert, formerly of “Fox and Friends,” to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
Not long before, the president turned to former Fox News executive Bill Shine to help oversee the White House’s communications office. A few months earlier, Trump tapped Fox News’ John Bolton to serve as White House national security advisor – in part because the president thought he was “good on television.”
Around the same time, the president chose Joe diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, to serve on his legal defense team. Both crossed the White House’s radar because they were – let’s all say it together – Fox News personalities. (Their role on the legal defense team was short lived.)
As regular readers may recall, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told Rachel on the show last year, “I’m concerned the president’s world is confined now to watching Fox News… Aside from his insular existence in the Oval Office, Fox is his whole world.”
Well, not his whole world: Trump hired television host Larry Kudlow to be the head of the White House National Economic Council – and Kudlow worked for CNBC.
He’s something of an exception, though. In addition to the aforementioned Fox veterans, Fox News’ K.T. McFarland was Trump’s deputy national security advisor; Fox News’ Monica Crowley was chosen to work at the National Security Council before a controversy forced her departure; Fox News’ Jonathan Wachtel was named the spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations; and Fox News contributors such as Ben Carson and Elaine Chao are already in the president’s cabinet.
Even Jay Sekulow, a top member of Trump’s legal defense team, has no relevant experience working on the issues he’s tackling now, but he has maintained a very high profile in recent years on conservative media, which very likely helped get him his current gig.
The Washington Post joked during the presidential transition period, “The Trump revolution won’t just be televised. It will be led by television talking heads.” It’s even truer now than it was then.
Following up on an item from last year, I should emphasize that as a rule, I’m not at all inclined to criticize those who watch a lot of cable news. It just so happens that I work for a cable-news television show and get paid by a cable-news network.
That said, it’s also fair to say that while we’ve had media-conscious presidents in American history, we’re never seen someone with the kind of obsession Trump has. To get a job on Team Trump, go on TV. To get a message to the president, go on TV. To influence the direction of the White House, go on TV.
This isn’t how the executive branch of a global superpower is supposed to work.

Pink Lloyd goes solo
Posted by Iannucci | 6/10/2009 | 2 comments »
This just in from Alex Lloyd's twitter account:
So I have decided to leave Ganassi Racing. I need to explore my options and get into a race car and to do that I need to be a free agent.
CGR have worked hard to find funding and I appreciate their efforts, I need to get back behind the wheel and this gives me my best chance.
In 2007 Alex utterly destroyed the Indy Pro Lights series, winning 8 of 15 events and finishing in the Top 5 an eye-popping 13 times. It seemed to be a huge step for Lloyd's career when he agreed to a development contract with Chip Ganassi, but other than a few Gran-Am races all it developed for Alex was two starts in the Indy 500. Well, that and a VERY pink firesuit.
Maybe the fact that Dan Wheldon left and Alex was not promoted into his spot played into this. Maybe the activities behind Robin Miller's recent proclamation that Scott Dixon might be leaving TCGR and replacements being considered are not named "Alex Lloyd" sealed the deal. Speculation aside, all the best of luck to Lloyd in his search for employment.

Brad // June 10, 2009 7:57 AM
I hope he is able to land something. Some thoughts have come to my mind about this are:
The rumor of Scott Dixon going to Gil De Ferran's new team if and when he starts would leave an opening.
Also heard along with that Chip was scouting Justin Wilson for his spot so where would that have left Lloyd?
If Alex is making the move to leave TCGR, he must have something lined up. Maybe not in IRL, but somewhere. It's pretty bold to leave a team in this season of sidelined drivers. (even if you are a backup)
best of luck and hope to see him back!

High Deportation Figures Under Obama Are Misleading

By Brian Bennett, Tribune Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON — Immigration activists have sharply criticized President Barack Obama for a rising volume of deportations, labeling him the “deporter in chief” and staging large protests that have harmed his standing with some Latinos, a key group of voters for Democrats.
But the portrait of a steadily increasing number of deportations rests on statistics that conceal almost as much as they disclose. A closer examination shows that immigrants living illegally in most of the continental U.S. are less likely to be deported today than before Obama came to office, according to immigration data.
Expulsions of people who are settled and working in the United States have fallen steadily since his first year in office, and are down more than 40 percent since 2009.
On the other side of the ledger, the number of people deported at or near the border has gone up — primarily as a result of changing who gets counted in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency’s deportation statistics.
The vast majority of those border crossers would not have been treated as formal deportations under most previous administrations. If all removals were tallied, the total sent back to Mexico each year would have been far higher under those previous administrations than it is now.
The shift in who gets tallied helped the administration look tough in its early years but now may be backfiring politically. Immigration advocates plan protests across the country this week around what they say will be the 2 millionth deportation under Obama — a mark expected to be hit in the next few days. And Democratic strategists fret about a decline in Latino voter turnout for this fall’s election.
Until recent years, most people caught illegally crossing the southern border were simply bused back into Mexico in what officials called “voluntary returns,” but which critics derisively termed “catch and release.” Those removals, which during the 1990s reached more 1 million a year, were not counted in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation statistics.
Now, the vast majority of border crossers who are apprehended get fingerprinted and formally deported. The change began during the George W. Bush administration and accelerated under Obama. The policy stemmed in part from a desire to ensure that people who had crossed into the country illegally would have formal charges on their records.
In the Obama years, all of the increase in deportations has involved people picked up within 100 miles of the border, most of whom have just recently crossed over. In 2013, almost two-thirds of deportations were in that category.
At the same time, the administration largely ended immigration roundups at workplaces and shifted investigators into targeting business owners who illegally hired foreign workers.
“If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero — it’s just highly unlikely to happen,” John Sandweg, until recently the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in an interview.
Even when immigration officials want to deport someone who already has settled in the country, doing so is “virtually impossible” because of a lengthy backlog in the immigration courts, Sandweg said. Once people who have no prior removals or convictions are placed in deportation proceedings, actually removing them from the country can take six years or more in some jurisdictions, Sandweg said.
Deportations of people apprehended in the interior of the U.S., which the immigration agency defines as more than 100 miles from the border, dropped from 237,941 in Obama’s first year to 133,551 in 2013, according to immigration data. Four out of five of those deportees came to the attention of immigration authorities after criminal convictions.
Many of those convictions are related to crossing the border — the other big consequence of the change in the way border removals are handled.
A growing number of people caught trying to cross the border now have a formal deportation order on their records. Entering the country without legal authorization is not a crime. But once a person has been deported, he can be prosecuted if he re-enters the country.
The policy of deporting border crossers and then prosecuting people who re-enter has increased the number of immigrants charged in federal court. In 1992, immigration offenses accounted for 5 percent of federal convictions. In the subsequent two decades, the share of immigration cases on the federal docket increased sixfold, according to a study by the Pew Research Center.
In 2012, immigration offenses made up 30 percent of federal convictions, second only to drug cases, which made up one-third.
The new system has criminalized immigration violations, notes Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, based in Los Angeles.
Immigration activists have pressured Obama to use his executive authority to stop deporting immigrants with close family ties in the U.S. and no criminal history other than immigration-related violations.
Deportations at the border can have an impact on families living within the U.S., said Doris Meissner, who headed the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000. An increasing portion of people illegally crossing the border today have lived in the U.S. before and have long-standing links to U.S. communities, she said.
“People trying to get back are increasingly people who have roots in the U.S.,” Meissner said.
The administration’s move to step up deportations at the border coincided with increased hiring of agents and spending on border security. In 2010, Congress approved a $600 million infusion to add border agents and new surveillance technology. There are now more than 21,000 Border Patrol agents on the border, twice the number of a decade ago.
During the first two years after coming to office, Obama administration officials touted the record-setting deportation figures, hoping that strict enforcement at the border would persuade Republicans to come to the negotiating table on immigration reform.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was “crowing” about the increasing deportations, said Marshall Fitz, an immigration expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington.
The Homeland Security Department “was patting itself on the back for reaching these record numbers,” Fitz said. “I think they thought it was important to show they were very serious about this.”
Sandweg, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, rejected the suggestion that political objectives drove deportation policy. By handing detainees over to immigration officials for deportation, rather than processing them directly, Border Patrol agents could spend more time on patrol, he said.
“From Day One we were following a policy that would emphasize public safety and border security,” Sandweg said.

02/29/12 Green Monday at the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection

The Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection joined the Animal Friends' initiative
- Employees of the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection choose solely meatless dishes one day a week
Following the suggestion of Animal Friends, the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection joined the campaign Green Monday. One day in a week the only choice for the employees of the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection on the menu of their restaurant are meatless dishes.
Among the main reasons for joining this campaign is the fact that a significant environmental impact comes from the livestock industry, which is one of the greatest generators of greenhouse gases that directly affect climate change.
Animal Friends would like to thank Minister Mirela Holy and the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection and invite other public authorities, institutions and companies to follow this commendable move.
The aim of the Green Monday campaign is to help people to improve their health and protect the environment by switching at least one day a week to a plant-based diet.
Reducing the negative impact of humans on the environment is largely facilitated by the selection of a plant-based diet. The same choice also affects the reduction of hunger in the world, water and natural resources conservation, the reduction of health care costs, etc.
In order to facilitate the introduction of the Green Monday into the lifestyle of the citizens, Animal Friends launched the web site www.zeleni-ponedjeljak.com. Besides plenty of information about the benefits of a plant-based diet for human health and the environment, one can register at the info-list in order to obtain new recipes for healthy, tasty meals via weekly e-mail.
Within the Green Monday campaign the documentary film "Meat the Truth" has also been translated into Croatian, while a teaser for Green Monday can be viewed here.
The Green Monday is part of an international campaign conducted in many countries and cities worldwide. Additional reasons for the introduction of the Green Monday campaign are:
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: According to the UN report, the livestock industry is responsible for as much as 19% of total greenhouse gas emissions, more than all global transport.
WATER CONSERVATION: Water requirements for cattle are immense, far above those for vegetables or grains. It is estimated that it takes 15,500 liters of water to produce one pound of meat. About 50% of water pollution in Europe is caused by factory farming of animals.
WORLD HUNGER REDUCTION: According to the Worldwatch Institute, only the total amount of soybeans and grains given to the livestock in the U.S. could feed all the people on the planet about five times.
FUEL DEPENDENCE REDUCTION: On average, about 40 calories of energy from fossil fuels go into one calorie of cow meat (compared with 2.2 for plant protein).
HEALTH CARE COSTS REDUCTION: Treating chronic illness can account for 70% of total health spending costs. A plant-based diet reduces the risk of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and cardiovascular disease and obesity.

12th November - Has the S&P retracement finished?
12 November 2018
TECHNICALS:
MONTHLY CHART
The market has simply retraced back to the steep uptrend from the moment in 2015 when the market accelerated away.
WEEKLY CHART This is a line chart of closing prices. The support and bounce from that diagonal support is clear. Certainly the bull market still looks intact. Two required conditions for the failure of the bull market: 1. A break of the bull trend diagonal 2. A break of the Prior low horizontal at 2600 or so
DAILY Dec S&P futures CHART This chart describes a wide trading range. The market has bounced hard from the lower boundary of the range. Note the pause at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement resistance. (Note too, that a drift and then a rally again up through that Fibonacci level would complete a bull H&S pattern.) Stand back while the market is within the range.
FUNDAMENTALS:
Has the sell-off in the S&P been resolved and if so, why? The retracement was originally driven by the twin fears of: 1. An escalating trade war between the US and China initiated by US President Donald Trump, based on the view that the trade relationship worked against US interests and that China was ‘stealing’ US intellectual property, and 2. An incrementally Hawkish Fed, as policy makers backed up their frequently voiced concerns about how the tight labour market, fuelled by strong economic growth, would eventually feed into higher inflation, leading to a projection of policy tightening extending into 2020. But, just as the market looked set to move beyond correction and flirt with bear market territory, the S&P bounced. The catalyst for the rejection of the lows was Trump’s comment about ten days ago that a trade deal with China was possible and it was reported that he had instructed officials to begin work on a deal. Clearly, if trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies could be reduced and eliminated, the outlook for both global trade and growth would be materially improved. But what of the Fed? Apart from the reality of policy moving into restrictive territory, even if only temporarily, the Fed’s independence had been questioned by Trump describing the Federal Reserve as “out of control”, a criticism never previously voiced by US Presidents.
However, the US mid-term elections have brought a degree of relief to that anxiety. The Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives, meaning that at best Trump will have a tougher job getting his policies through Congress and at worst he may be unable to progress any of his policies and face a deeper investigation of the 2016 election result and possibly his own personal financial affairs. Moreover, if he had plans to interfere with the Fed’s independence and mandate, the midterm results will make that path a blind alley. So although the mid-term election results point to grid lock in Washington, for many who saw Trump’s policies as not only working against US national interests and worse still, alienating traditional US allies, grid lock looks like a good result. For the S&P, traders will eventually get used to the Fed’s policy stance. A period of rising rates against a backdrop of strong economic growth, with inflation largely contained, is no reason to sell equities. And if Trump actually manages to start trade negotiations with China, that look like ending the nascent trade war, then the S&P could resume its earlier bull trend. For now, traders will be relieved that Trump appears willing to talk about a trade deal rather than building up trade barriers with yet more tariffs on Chinese imports. In summary, the environment for stocks still looks fragile; trade deals take years to negotiate. But if Bully Trump has given way to Negotiating Trump then this market has probably seen the lows for now.

Mary Giles’ interest in basketry blossomed when she was a schoolteacher, explaining the basics of the craft to high schoolers in the 1970s.
Over the past four decades, Giles helped move the boundaries of basket weaving and earned international recognition for her art, which is characterized by coiled waxed-linen bases adorned with hammered metal or fine wire that brings to mind tree bark, fish scales, feathers or fur.
“You might look at her work and say ‘Why is anyone calling this a basket?’ It’s not something you would put your apples in,” said Lois Russell, a Boston-based artist, collector and former president of the National Basketry Organization. “She’s one of the people who took the concepts of basketry technique and pioneered using them to make sculptural work.”
Giles died April 11 of ovarian cancer. She was 73. She lived in a home along the river between Stillwater and Marine on St. Croix.
Born Mary Jo Mortenson in St. Paul to a father who made cabinets and a mother who quilted and did Norwegian rosemaling, she graduated from Mankato State University with a degree in arts education. She and her first husband, Doug Giles, moved to St. Louis, where he worked for the May Co. and she was a teacher in the upscale Ladue school district. After she and Giles divorced, she stayed in St. Louis.
She took a basketry workshop from Jane Sauer and John McQueen and started making art for sale. Her art dealer introduced her to Jim Harris, an architect and part-time art critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the two started dating and eventually married.
Giles’ career as an artist took off after she retired as a schoolteacher in the late 1990s, and she and Harris moved to Minnesota in 2006.
Her art required meticulous attention to detail. She created all the metal pieces she used in a workshop above her garage, using hammers and drills to flatten or coil the material. A typical day started at 8:30 a.m. in her studio, either weaving or adorning a woven base. She would work until lunch, and then spend the afternoon in the garden or in her metal workshop. After dinner, she would often go back to the studio. Harris always drove, because Giles’ art could usually fit on her lap and she worked on it in the car.
“If we would go on a vacation, when we came back I would have to avoid her for a while because she was trying to make up for lost time,” Harris said. “She always worked, and even after she had cancer, whenever she was well enough, she was in the studio.”
There is no easy way to categorize Giles’ art. At first what she made in some ways resembled a basket, but over the years the forms became more abstract. One piece looks like a boulder broken in two, another like a jellyfish, another like a series of stick figures standing atop each other.
“I admire the directness and honesty I see in tribal art and I try to incorporate those qualities in my own art,” Giles said in her artists’ statement for her retrospective exhibit at the Textile Center in Minneapolis in 2015.
Her work is in the collections of more than 15 museums throughout the United States, including the Minneapolis Institute of Art. She was recognized as Master of the Medium for fiber art and baskets in 2013 by the James Renwick Alliance, which supports the Renwick Gallery at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.
“She called herself a fiberist. She wouldn’t say, ‘I’m a basket weaver,’ ” said Karl Reichert, executive director of the Textile Center. “She encouraged all of us to think very broadly about the impacts of fiber art.”
Giles is survived by Harris, her sister Jane Sweeney and her brother Tom Mortenson. Services are private.

The trouble with Facebook is the people
Basically, we have little to say. Maybe that's why snail mail was so effective.

Forget about the privacy concerns, the onslaught of ads, the annoying design of your profile page. If people are slowly turning away from Facebook, it's not because the company has overreached or gone over to the dark side.
It's because we've come to realize that people are boring.
Surely you've noticed this yourself, as you've scrolled through updates about vacations and restaurant meals, plus notices about how many of your friends are currently playing Candy Crush Saga.
A survey released last week by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that 61 percent of Facebook users have taken a "Facebook vacation," for reasons that had little to do with how the company behaves. "Too busy" was the most common complaint, followed by "just wasn't interested" and "it was a waste of time."
"It's a reckoning moment," said Lee Rainie, the director of the Pew project. "People are making little mental calculations about how much time do I want to devote to this, what's the quality of the material I get from my friends?"
This is, in some ways, a significant milestone in our growing relationship with social media. Early complaints about Facebook centered on the fact that interactions were fake: hand-picked, overglossed, idealized personal statements that were bound to make your friends feel insecure, and vice versa. But now that we're all familiar with the Facebook mask, the problem might be that our posts are too real, and that reality isn't worth our time.
Earnest efforts to promote unplugging, such as the annual Screen Free Week, are gaining traction, and Facebook's policies have done their part to diminish our trust. But it turns out that our own inanity is also a powerful force.
Not that it's time to fear for Mark Zuckerberg's welfare. Facebook is used by a mind-boggling 67 percent of adult Americans online, including your mother, your father, your great-aunt Hilda, and your long-lost friend from high school with a political vendetta. The fact that we're now settling into a mature routine is actually a sign of how intertwined our lives are with our feeds -- and how much we feel an obligation to take part.
As much as I grumble, after all, I still feel compelled to dip into the Facebook universe every few days, posting photos of depressingly minor life events -- Attention, world! My child went to the dentist! -- or scrolling down the news feed and "liking" 15 items in one sitting. I'm marking my presence, like a dog. If I lay off the site for a few days, I invariably miss six birthdays and feel like a jerk. If I stay away for longer, I worry I'll miss big news.
Every new medium eventually finds its purpose. Twitter works great as a news aggregator and wisecrack-sharing platform. Pinterest is a gallery for home-decor ideas. Facebook has become the accepted repository for information about births, deaths, and traumatic family events. It's also reasonably good for mobilizing social movements and conducting virtual yard sales.
For photos of kids and vacations? Well, there's this nifty thing called paper. A few weeks ago, we finally took down our display of holiday cards, those cheery family photos that Facebook should have rendered obsolete. They still feel more valuable than the average digital post, precisely because they're worth the cost of bulk printing and a stamp, and because they require the physical act of opening an envelope.
Holiday cards are one of the last remaining things that we still instinctively send by mail, along with thank-you notes and the occasional party invitation. Right after the Pew Facebook study came out, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it was dropping Saturday delivery, prompting a flood of lamentations -- on social media, of course -- from people who may not have written a letter by hand in years. I, too, will miss the weekend mail, but it's hard to argue with reality. The other day, the sum total of my mail was an electric bill and a flier from Costco.
If someone sent you a snail-mail photo of his kids every day or every week, you'd think he suffered from a personality disorder. But holiday cards are an annual thrill, precisely because they come once a year. Looking for a new, Facebook 2.0 standard for how much we ought to share? It turns out we might have had it all along.

ORISSA FLOOD DISASTER COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED:
Written By BiharWatch on Saturday, September 20, 2008 | 9:01 AM
ORISSA FLOOD DISASTER COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED: WRONG OPERATION OF HIRAKUD DAM RESPONSIBLE
The wrong operation of Hirakud Dam is majorly responsible for the current flood disaster in Mahanadi basin in Orissa. The Hirakud dam operators have kept the water level way above the rule curve recommended for the dam in 1988, ever since Aug 1, 2008, when the rule curve for current year comes into operation. Had the dam operated in a way to keep the level below the recommended level, the current flood disaster could have been avoided.
The water flow in Mahanadi basin at Mundali barrage is 14.6 lakh cusecs (cubic feet per second), way above the safe limit of 10 lakh cusec, as recommended by the August 2007 report of "the High Level Committee to Study Various Aspects of Water Usage for Hirakud Reservoir", appointed by the Government of Orissa. Out of the 14.6 lakh cusecs flowing in Mahanadi, over 4.62 lakh cusecs is released by Hirakud dam. If Hirakud Dam had not released the water when the downstream areas were experiencing heavy rainfall, the amount the flow at Mundali barrage would have remained within the safe limit of 10 lakh cusecs as recommended by the High Level Hirakud Committee (HLHC), and there would have been no flood disaster.
The Hirakud dam operators are forced to release over 4.62 lakh cusecs, because the water level at Hirakud dam has already reached the Full Reservoir Level of 630 feet on Sept 18, 2008, which should have been reached that level twelve days later on Sept 30, 2008. And the water level at Hirakud has reached the full level so fast because the operators had consistently kept the water level very high, way above the recommended level.
For example, on Aug 1, 2008, the recommended water level at Hirakud dam was 590 feet, but the actual water level on that date was already way high at 607.5 feet. On Aug 13, 2008, the water level was 618.5 feet, against the recommended level of 606 feet. On Sept 10, 2008, the water level was 627 feet, just three feet below the full level, when the recommended level was only 623 feet.
Hirakud dam is one of the few dams of India where flood control cushion has been provided in its storage capacity. The idea is that the flood cushion portion of the storage should not be filled right till the end of the monsoon, which is in the first week of Oct. By filling up the reservoir to full capacity before the end of monsoon, the dam operators have destroyed the flood control role of the Hirakud dam and thus brought an avoidable flood disaster on the people of Orissa. This disaster could have been avoided, had they operated the dam keeping in mind the flood cushion role of the reservoir.
Here it may be added that the Central Water Commission (CWC) of the Government of India has been using completely outdated figures of reservoir capacities. For example, for Hirakud, while the HLHC has said that the live storage capacity of Hirakud in 2007 was down to 4.647 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) (down from 5.818 BCM at the time of start up in 1957), CWC's reservoir storage website (http://www.cwc.gov.in/Reservoir_level.htm) says the Hirakud's live storage capacity is 5.378 BCM. This is higher than that given by even CWC's own 1995 study of Hirakud siltation, which said the live capacity by that year had gone down to 4.934 BCM. It is also shocking to note that CWC's flood forecast site first time (during the current phase) mentioned the Mahanadi floods only on September 19, 2008, after the news was already out in the media. What is the value of such forecasts of CWC?
The Orissa government needs to answer to the people of Orissa, why this shocking manmade disaster was allowed to happen and what it would do to ensure that those who are responsible for the wrong operation of the Hirakud dam are held accountable?

Spina Bifida
Overview and Facts
Spina Bifida is broader term for a birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal do not close before birth. Spina bifida includes any birth defect involving insufficient closure of the spine.
Spina bifida occulta is a condition in which the bones of the spine do not close but the spinal cord and meninges remain in place and skin usually covers the defect.
Meningoceles is a condition where the tissue covering the spinal cord sticks out of the spinal defect but the spinal cord remains in place.
A myelomeningocele is a congenital (present at birth) deformity and the most serious form of spina bifida. It can occur anywhere along the spinal cord. With myelomeningocele, the spinal canal is open.

New Jersey Liquor Licensing Purchase Cost Discrepancies
By Wells, Jaworksi & Liebman, LLP on September 10, 2014 in Miscellaneous
Liquor licensing, in New Jersey, is highly regulated. In fact, New Jersey is one of the strictest states, on the issue, in the nation but many of the regulations are outdated, including the manner in which it is determined how many licenses a particular municipality has. For a variety of reasons, in some municipalities in Bergen County, the average purchase price for a retail consumption liquor license can exceed a million dollars. In other municipalities in and outside of Bergen County, the purchase price can be as little as $50,000.00. Thus, there is a movement gathering steam for the State to reform the overall system so as to make liquor licenses more uniform in value and thus, more affordable. This would potentially lead to more available licenses. The idea behind it is to stimulate economic development with more restaurants, life style centers and the like. Assemblymen John Burzichelli, D. Gloucester is championing the cause. We will be closely watching the issue as a proposed bill currently being written, makes its way through Trenton in the coming months.

Noteworthy Summer 2002
By Wells, Jaworksi & Liebman, LLP on June 1, 2002 in Legal Update
Although he has been with us since late last year, it’s not too late to publically welcome our newest Associate, George Christopoulos. George is active in the Real Estate, Litigation and Transactional areas of our practice. He received his undergraduate degree from Seton Hall University, and his law degree from Widener University School of Law in Delaware. Before joining WJ&L, LLP, George served as a Law Clerk to the Honorable M. Alan Vogelson of the Superior Court. George is a very welcome addition to our staff.Elsewhere in this edition of the Legal Update, read all about our newest Partner, Jim Maggio. In addition to becoming a Partner of the firm effective April 1st, Jim was recently installed as a Member of the Board of Directors for the Paramus Chamber of Commerce.
Partner, Jim Delia, who with his family moved to Ho-Ho-Kus a year or so ago, has now been appointed to the Ho-Ho-Kus Public Schools Future Growth Committee. The committee has been asked to help determine the school’s physical plant needs in the future years.
Partner, Tom Wells, who divides his time between the Paramus office, and our office in Bristol, Vermont, reports that he is now a member of the Bristol Planning Commission. Those who know Tom, know he is a veteran of literally hundreds of appearances before Planning Boards and Commissions, and Boards of Adjustments on behalf of clients. It is interesting to think of Tom on the other side of the table.
Congratulations to the youngest son, Andrew, of Partner, Stuart Liebman, and wife, Arlene, who celebrated his Bar Mitzvah several weeks ago. Andrew did a great job!
Partner, Cheryl Morrissey, continues to be active in the Justice Morris Pashman Inns of Court. Recently, Cheryl chaired the successful 10th Anniversary Dinner for this organization and managed to secure highly regarded Justice Randy Holland of the Delaware Supreme Court as the keynote speaker.
Congratulations to the Ridgewood Public Library and its newly formed Ridgewood Public Library Foundation. Tom Wells of our office worked with this group to form this new 501(c)(3) qualified foundation and has also agreed to remain on the Board, at least for a little while, to help things get up and running for this foundation which supports what used to be Tom’s hometown library.
Last, but not least, congratulations to Associate, Linda Herlihy and her husband, Michael. Linda who is just back full-time after a maternity leave, successfully introduced into the world on February 4, 2002, a daughter, Elizabeth Rose.

Multimedia from this Release
In another industry first, Sterling Planet supplied wind RECs to neutralize the environmental impacts of AWEA WINDPOWER 2012 and make this the first WindMade event in North America.
AWEA WINDPOWER 2012, held in Sterling Planet's hometown of Atlanta, tapped the company's wind energy supply to attain 100% offsets and earn the WindMade label.
Only events that use 100% wind energy qualify for the WindMade label.

NEWSROOM: Sterling Planet
CONTENT: Press Release
(3BL Media) Atlanta, GA - June 19, 2012 – Sterling Planet has supplied wind renewable energy certificates (RECs) for the American Wind Energy Association’s (AWEA) WINDPOWER 2012 Conference and Exposition, making the June event in Atlanta the first in North America to be labeled by WindMade as 100% powered by wind.
Sterling Planet supplied wind RECs to match the total electricity consumed at the event, including event preparations at the AWEA offices, the power usage at the Georgia World Congress Center, and electricity used at social events such as receptions and conference dinners.
“Wind power already provides approximately 20 percent of electricity in places like Iowa and South Dakota – and now, thanks to Sterling Planet and WindMade, WINDPOWER 2012 was 100% wind powered,” AWEA CEO Denise Bode said. “The WindMade label is an important development for our industry, and highlighting it at WINDPOWER is one way to show how the clean, affordable energy source that our industry produces is generating both electricity and jobs today for America.”
WindMade is the world’s first global consumer label for companies, events and products using wind power. The label is managed by the WindMade nonprofit organization, which is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of renewable energy by improving companies’ ability to communicate their wind energy investments to their stakeholders.
“We are delighted to see AWEA use the WindMade label for this flagship event,” WindMade CEO Henrik Kuffner said. “Procuring wind power for a convention as large as WINDPOWER 2012 will make a real difference to its overall environmental impact, and WindMade is proud to provide a tool to communicate this commitment in a meaningful way to visitors.”
Delivering the large wind REC volume needed for the 100% WindMade AWEA conference was standard operating procedure for Sterling Planet, ranked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the top U.S. renewable energy provider in volume of sales to voluntary buyers.
“With pride, we provided AWEA with certified wind RECs from projects located nationwide and into Canada,” said Mel Jones, Sterling Planet President and CEO. “We’re accustomed to this kind of demand for wind energy, which continues to drive the growth of Sterling Planet’s client base and contribute to expansion of the wind industry.”
Sterling Planet leads the nation in retail sales of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and is the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of carbon-reduction assets – RECs, carbon offsets and innovative White Tags® energy efficiency certificates. Founded in 2000, the company was the first to offer RECs to retail clients nationwide and was a pioneer in early development and certification of the REC market. This year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ranks Sterling Planet No. 1 in terms of renewable kWh provided to members of the EPA Green Power Partnership, with more than 5 billion kWh delivered to Partnership members, including the top three purchasers. In compliance markets, Sterling Planet is a leading supplier to government agencies and has partnered with 160 utilities nationwide.

On November 15, 2011, Occupy Wall Street protesters were forced out of Zuccotti Park by the New York City police. For a few days, it seemed as if the movement might be coming to an end — but it wasn’t. It’s been a year now, and Occupy initiatives have continued in cities and towns across the country. Click through our slideshow to find out what the occupiers accomplished after the occupation ended.

Defining moments in Canada’s identity
Some may quibble with their methods, means and policy agenda. Others may laud their no-nonsense approach to national governance and economic stewardship. But, as the days begin to set on 2013, all must agree that Canada’s Conservative leadership is not the laissez-faire bunch it once proudly billed itself to be. Far from it.
In fact, no federal government since the early 1960s has spent more time deliberately branding itself and, in the process, redefining what it means to be a Canuck – good or bad.
Even those among us who do not subscribe to such late-model Tory notions as patriotism, self-reliance and personal responsibility as social policy must admit that’s it’s never been easier to answer that perennially posed and quintessentially Canadian question: “Who am I?”
Under the Conservatives, Canada is a law-abiding, right-thinking nation of 33 million souls. Forget the Great White North of old: haven for draft dodgers and Liberal elites run amok. Ours is a nation teetering at the edge of chaos, but for our timely embrace of law and order. Or so says the Department of Justice.
“There were almost two million Criminal Code violations reported to police in 2011,” the web site declares. “There were more than 424,400 violent incidents reported to police in 2011. Violent crime accounted for about one-fifth of the offences reported to police in 2011. Although most types of violent crime decreased or remained stable in 2011, there was a 7 per cent increase in the rate of homicides.
“The total costs of crime have been estimated at $99.6B per year – the majority of which ($82.5B or 83%) was borne by victims: $14.3 billion is directly attributable to tangible costs such as medical attention, hospitalizations, lost wages, missed school days, stolen/damaged property. Productivity losses represent 47 per cent of the tangible costs borne by victims followed by stolen/damaged property (42.9 per cent) and health care costs (10.1 per cent). Total intangible costs (including pain and suffering and loss of life) is $68.2 billion.”
Under the Conservatives, Canada is a natural resources behemoth, ready to flood the world with its oil, natural gas and mineral wealth. Forget the people who once went out of their way to represent themselves as anything but hewers of wood and drawers of water. Or so says the Department of Natural Resources.
“Natural resources are an important part of the fabric of Canada’s economy,” declares the web site. “Natural resources are poised to play an even bigger role in our future. . It’s estimated that hundreds of major resource projects are currently underway in Canada or planned over the next 10 years, worth approximately $650 billion in investment. That $650 billion figure represents hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs in every sector of our economy, in every region of Canada.
“That’s why our Government has a plan to unleash Canada’s natural resource potential. We call it Responsible Resource Development. This plan is streamlining reviews of major projects by ensuring more predictable and timely reviews, reducing duplication, strengthening environmental protection, and enhancing consultations with Aboriginal peoples.”
Under the Conservatives, Canada is a proud country, clearly informed by its history. Forget any notion that ours is the only country in the world that was granted its independence after asking for it politely. Or so says Prime Minister Stephen Harper on the official War of 1812 web site:
“The War of 1812 was a seminal event in the making of our great country. On the occasion of its 200th anniversary, I invite all Canadians to share in our history and commemorate our proud and brave ancestors who fought and won against enormous odds. As we near our country’s 150th anniversary in 2017, Canadians have an opportunity to pay tribute to our founders, defining moments, and heroes who fought for Canada.
“The War helped establish our path toward becoming an independent and free country, united under the Crown with a respect for linguistic and ethnic diversity. The heroic efforts of Canadians then helped define who we are today, what side of the border we live on, and which flag we salute.”
Some may quibble with all of this. Under the Conservatives, however, none remain confused for long.

2013: The year of treading water
N.B. economy is heading for a repeat of 2013. . .only worse
New Brunswick enters the new year much as it did the outgoing one: Treading shark-infested waters, praying that the mighty predators will ignore it in favour of fatter, tastier castaways.
Under the grim circumstances, it’s a miracle that the government of David Alward was able to accomplish the little it did.
In 2013, population growth was at a standstill, general unemployment was among the worst in Canada (especially among what remains of the youthful labour force), the participation rate (those actively searching for work) was in a nose dive. About the only bright spot was low inflation and a relatively fixed consumer price index (measured in 2002 dollars).
Worse, perhaps, than any of this was the evident lack of new economic opportunities, without which the annual provincial deficit was fated to hover at $500 million on a structural, long-term debt of at least $11 billion in perpetuity. Theoretically, that meant that every New Brunswicker was on the hook for thousands of dollars.
The reality was that fewer public services were available to a dwindling number of people. And in the absence of any real vision for the future – any sense that timely sacrifices will ultimately yield durable boons – the province descended into caterwauling and complaining.
Some, of course, did their best to reverse the tide of bitterness and recrimination, while acknowledging the patently obvious.
“What we are facing in New Brunswick is a structural, secular decline,” former premier and current deputy chairman of T-D Bank Frank McKenna told me one wintery afternoon in his downtown Toronto office. “The problems we have don’t ebb and flow with the quality of our leadership. There is something more serious going on here. We face circumstances that combine to create a very negative outlook. The entire atmosphere is hugely challenging.”
In fact, he said, “the resource base that remains can be exploited with fewer workers and more mechanization, so it can’t support the number of workers that it once did. Yet, we remain a resource-based economy in a world where the Canadian dollar looks to be in a fairly constant state of parity with the U.S. dollar. So, this, too, is a peril.”
And yet, he said, “Even though I think our situation in New Brunswick is quite pessimistic, I don’t think that it is terminal. There are many places in the world that have faced dramatic challenges. In fact, adversity, itself, became the platform upon which they built sustainable economies. . . This isn’t just a problem of leadership in government. It’s also a problem of followership.
“Our citizens have to understand the full depth and breadth of the dilemma that we are facing, and they have to be prepared to face up to some inconvenient truths. It means that they have to become less reliant on government and more entrepreneurial. It means that they have to take responsibility for their own futures.”
For Mr. McKenna and, indeed, Mr. Alward, taking responsibility for the future means brining Alberta oil east for refining in Saint John – which would create thousands of construction jobs – and developing the province’s nascent shale gas industry.
“The way I look at it,” Mr. McKenna said, “the real win comes when we take our indigenous shale gas in the province and hook it into the Canaport liquified natural gas (LNG) facility in Saint John.”
His voice rose as his enthusiasm peaked. “We have in situ now, calculated by Corridor Resources Inc., 67 trillion cubic feet of gas. That’s bigger than western Canada. It’s a huge deposit. If ten per cent is exploitable, that’s enough to create a revenue source for New Brunswick for decades to come. All in, it would result in about $15-20 billion in investment and 150,000 person years of work. And for governments, it would result in between $7-9 billion worth of royalties and taxes.”
By and large, however, these were mere musings of a former public official. They did little to quell the outrage of a vocal minority of residents – people who firmly believed the provincial government had no business encouraging the development of an industry that they said would poison them.
Would it poison them? Was there, instead, a safe, environmentally responsible approach to the whole affair?
The issue will carry forward into 2014 and, like just about every other issue in New Brunswick, remain there unresolved, as the sharks keep circling.

Where would 2013 be without its “Fordisms”?
Without Toronto’s comfortably stout, malapropismatically challenged, temporarily reassigned mayor and chief magistrate, 2013 would have been a dull year, indeed, for professional scribblers like me.
Not a day has passed since May when Rob Ford hasn’t managed to either delight or outrage (oftentimes, both) the chattering classes with his peculiar brand of outburst. (We must now, all of us, seriously consider adding ‘Fordism’ to the lexicon of contemporary English).
As a report from CTV noted earlier this month, “Toronto Mayor Rob Ford responded to a U.S. sports radio show’s question about what he was getting his wife for Christmas by saying: ‘Just money, women love money.’ Ford made the comment Thursday during his regular phone-in chat onSports Junkies, on 106.7 The Fan, based in Washington, D.C.
“Ford is on the show to talk sports and make NFL picks, but when one of the hosts asked Ford about his holiday gift-giving plans for his wife Renata, he replied: ‘Just money. Women love money. Give them a couple of thousand bucks and they’re happy. Get some treats on the side obviously for her,’ he said. ‘At the end of the day, she wants her cash. So I give her a nice cheque and we’re all happy. When asked what he hoped to get from his wife, Ford said: ‘She always surprises me. I have a fantastic wife.’
The comments come a day after Ford apologized for the second time to Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale, who had threatened to sue the mayor for comments he made on a television interview earlier this month for former media baron Conrad Black.”
Those comments intimated that Mr. Dale may harbour an unseemly interest in young children, a postulation that prompted a libel notice. And Mr. Ford’s response?
“I wholly retract my statements and apologize to Mr. Dale without reservation for what I said,” his mea culpa declared. “There is absolutely no basis for the statement I made about Daniel Dale taking pictures of children or any insinuations I made.”
The apology was an order of magnitude stronger than his initial ‘oops’ in which he said that he didn’t believe that “Mr. Dale is a pedophile”. Nor did he “intend to suggest that in (his) comments. I wish to sincerely apologize again to Mr. Dale if my actual words have caused him any harm or personal offence.”
By now, Mr. Ford’s ‘I’m sorry’ routine is famous. Thanks to an excellent account assembled by the CBC, we know that Mr. Ford apologizes a lot:
“Dec. 17: Reluctantly apologized for suggesting members of council were ‘corrupt.’ He initially said he withdrew his comments, but speaker Frances Nunziata said he needed to apologize. ‘How about, I am so sorry,’ Ford said sarcastically. ‘Is that as good as I apologize? Or, ‘So sorry?’ Which one do you want, Madam Speaker? Like, ‘Super, super, super, super, super, super, super sorry? So sorry?’
“Nov. 18: Apologizes for running into Coun. Pam McConnelland knocking her over during a council meeting to strip the mayor of most of his powers. ‘It was a complete accident,’ Ford said. ‘I do sincerely apologize to you, Coun. McConnell.’
“Nov. 14: Apologizes for crude remarks he made earlier that day in which he denied offering a former female staffer oral sex, saying he had ‘more than enough to eat at home.’ Later that day, Ford said: ‘I want to apologize for my graphic remarks this morning.’
“Nov. 8: Appears ashamed while delivering a statement in response to a video that surfaced of a rambling, enraged Ford in a profanity-laced tirade in which he threatens to kill someone. ‘Obviously, I was extremely, extremely inebriated,’ he said. ‘I’ve made mistakes. I don’t know what to say.’
“Nov. 5: Apologizes after admitting he had indeed smoked crack cocaine, likely in one of his drunken stupors. ‘I know what I did was wrong and admitting it was the most difficult and embarrassing thing I have ever had to do,’ he said. ‘To the residents of Toronto, I know I have let you down. And I can’t do anything else but apologize, and apologize.’
“May 27: Apologizes to reporters for calling them a ‘bunch of maggots’ during his radio show. “I’m sure you understand this has been a very stressful week for myself and my family, but that doesn’t justify using the terminology I did in describing the media. I sincerely apologize to each and every one of you.’”
Don’t mention it, Mr. Ford.
God bless your outbursts, every one.

Looking for some late arriving holiday cheer
Bah, humbug. . .to creeping incivilities
Perhaps it’s the ludicrously hard start (even for Canada) of winter this year. Or maybe it’s the fact that my wife and I will not be enjoying the company of our kids and grandkids for Christmas dinner (it’s the in-laws turns). But my mood, though not yet churlish, has become unusually susceptible to the creeping incivilities of others.
I have mused awhile about Canada’s Industry Minister James Moore, who told a journalist earlier this month that the federal government is not responsible for helping hungry kids. His exact words were: “Certainly, we want to make sure that kids go to school full-bellied, but is that always the government’s job to be there to serve people their breakfast? Is it my job to feed my neighbour’s child? I don’t think so.”
Quite right, Mr. Moore. In other, more famous, words the sentiment persists: “Are there no prisons? And the Union workhouses; are they still in operation? Those who are badly off must go there. If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”
To be fair to Mr. Moore, he did apologize (then again, so did Scrooge, after a fashion). The industry minister allowed that he chose his words poorly and that he deeply regretted his insensitivity. Indeed, he said, “all levels of government, all members of our society, have a responsibility to be compassionate and care for those in need. While more work is needed, I know the cause of fighting poverty is not helped by comments like those I made.”
Still, the question at the base of this unfortunate fracas has found expression in other venues. Specifically, “How obliged are the authorities to save us from ourselves?”
Globe and Mail columnist Margaret Wente (who makes a productive habit of ticking off her readers) really wants to know. The question, she wrote last week, “is at the heart of many public policy debates, including the new one over whether to expand the CPP. If you are a semi-upper-middle-class person who hasn’t saved for your retirement, then you’re in for a shock. The question is whether the government should cushion that shock by forcing you (and everyone else) to save more. My personal view is no – especially because it would mean extra taxes on the young, who’ve already been screwed enough. The government has a duty to save you from outright poverty, but after that, you’re on your own.”
So, that’s the choice? Penury or plentitude? No middle ground for a middle class that hasn’t been able to save for its retirement thanks at least partly to government fiscal mismanagement? Nope, because as Ms. Wente declares, “Sadly, minimalism in government has gone out of fashion. Today, it’s the maternalists who rule. They believe that people are like children who, if left unattended, will spend all their allowance and leave the spinach on their plate. Since the people can’t be trusted to act in their own best interests, the authorities must nag and nudge and regulate us into doing so.”
Authorities, presumably, like Canada’s Justice Minister Peter MacKay who insists that judges across Canada stop screwing around with the victim surcharge process during sentencing.
Currently, convicted parties must pay $100 for each summary offence and $200 for each indictable one. According to a CTV item last week, “Ontario Court Justice Colin Westman does not believe courts should impose the ‘victim services surcharge’ on impoverished or mentally ill criminals. ‘It’s unrealistic,’ Justice Westman says. ‘So if it’s not unrealistic, aren’t you bringing disrespect on this court by imposing things that either aren’t going to be enforced or can’t be enforced?”
Maybe, but Mr. MacKay – playing his “father knows best” routine – says do it anyway. “Judges cannot ignore the role of the Crown in passing legislation in our democratically elected Parliament of Canada,” he told the Globe and Mail. “Therefore, they are there like everybody else to respect the law, not flout it. . .A $100 or $200 surcharge is out of proportion to the rehabilitation and the respect that needs to occur in a justice system? I just fundamentally disagree with that. We believe as a government that giving victims a real role and respect within our justice system includes the victim fine surcharge.”
What can a victim of a crime can do with an extra hundred bucks-or-so? Save it for a rainy day. Increasingly, it looks like he (and the rest of us) will need it.

Sweetening the CPP is long overdue
It’s always disheartening, though lamentably predictable, when politicians, who ought to know better, adopt the talking points of a vested interest to justify the clearly unjustifiable.
So, when Canada’s Finance Minister Jim Flaherty says that “now is not the time for CPP payroll tax increases”, as he did earlier this month following a meeting with his provincial counterparts in Meech Lake, P.Q., he is merely lifting a line from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) playbook, to wit:
“CPP/QPP increases would mean a significant premium hike for working Canadians and even more serious impacts for the economy. . .Higher labour costs, with no increase in productivity, would lead to job losses or reduced hours for many workers over the first ten years of a CPP increase, and wages would go down by 1.5 per cent. Many Canadians would go without work for years. Some might escape unscathed, but everyone would be at risk.”
This dire warning appears on the organization’s web site, where “research” clearly indicates that most Canadians don’t want to pay higher premiums because, simply, they can’t afford the ones they are facing right now.
Instead, an Angus Reid Global survey says “they believe that government should control spending and reduce taxes to allow more savings. Moreover, many feel that new incentives and voluntary measures to save through existing and new retirement savings tools including the CPP/QPP are the next most effective solutions. Immediate CPP/QPP mandatory increases impose adverse effects: about half of working Canadians express that such increases would reduce their ability to spend on essential goods and services such as food and housing while close to three in four business owners would face increased pressure to freeze or cut workers’ salaries.”
I am not prepared to concede that “most Canadians” actually feel this way, but even if they do, this doesn’t mean that they are right.
As a Globe and Mail editorial, entitled “Flaherty to savers: You’re on your own with CPP as it stands”, admirably pointed out a couple of weeks ago, “The CPP is not a welfare program, or an income-redistribution program. It’s not paid for by taxes. It’s a defined-benefit pension plan, and how much you get out of the program is based on how much you put in. It’s actuarially sound, independently run and low-cost. It’s one of the world’s best-run retirement safety nets. But the maximum pension for a lifetime of contributions is just $12,000.”
Clearly, that is not enough for most working Canadians. By “most”, I am not referring to the rich or lucky few who stand to pull one of those gilded public pensions that assorted bargaining units have been loathe to see watered down.
Nor am I talking about the impoverished, who must subsist on various forms state-supplied handouts and subsidies.
I am looking straight into the worried eyes of those who populate the once sturdy middle class in this country.
The sad fact is Canadians with steady incomes don’t save enough for their retirements. They haven’t in some time. Pundits of quasi-Libertarian bent and their right-wing fellow travelers in political office adoring placing the blame for this conditions squarely at the feet of the non-savers. They’re spendthrifts or layabouts or, simply, poorly advised about their options .
The truth, however, is complex, involving many factors that are out of an individual’s control, not the least of which was the disastrous implosion of financial markets a few years back – a calamity that destroyed trillions of dollars in personal assets, including those held in retirement portfolios, all over the world.
Nothing, of course, will rebuild these funds. But even a small expansion of the CPP – which is a far less risky savings instrument than just about every other option – will buffer the financial shock of a lower living standard in retirement.
What’s more, it will cost far less now to sweeten the CPP than it will to prop up droves of aging Canadians who will fall into poverty and endure all of its associated evils: ill health, hunger homelessness.

Humour
Enough already with Night Before Christmas!
‘Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
Though Pete van Loan was seen making the scene
The smile on his face, supremely serene
“This year I bring you wishes and tidings so dear”
Said the government House Leader, reeking of cheer
“Parliament works wondrously well” he croaked
“There’s no need to fix it, if it ain’t broked”
“Broked”? Hmmm.
Okay, dear reader, that’s all you get. I am officially hanging up my weathered beret and shoving the quill I reserve for penning pretentious verse in the drawer where I keep other mementos of the writing life. And good riddance.
Poor, old, dead Clement Clarke Moore – the guy who composed the original “‘Twas the Night before Christmas” back in 1823 – must be rolling in his stony grave, what with all the wretched adaptations of his poem (shall we call it iconic?) he has had to endure, lo these many decades since he shuffled off this mortal coil.
What is it about this rhyming trifle that sends politicians into paroxysms of parody at this jolly time of the year?
Witness New Brunswick Tory MLA Kirk MacDonald’s effort to skewer his federal colleagues a la Moore:
‘Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was, not even a mouse
Dominic hid by the chimney with glee
In hopes he could turn more Grits NDP
Now witness New Brunswick Liberal Deputy Leader Victor Boudreau, not to be outdone, deliver a slam in doggerel to his provincial rivals:
‘Twas the night before Christmas, and the House was still sitting
The premier was struggling, to stick to his knitting
His caucus was fighting, the ship it was sinking
The mood was so bad, even Betts might start drinking.
Ah yes, what true poet laureates New Brunswick has in its elected officials. Perhaps we can sell their words on the open market to help pay down the $500-million deficit and $11-billion long-term debt they’ve managed to accumulate for us over the past five years, or so.
After all, Americans love their various adaptations of Mr. Moore’s abiding claim to fame. Mostly, at any rate.
A correspondent on the social networking site, Tumblr entreats, “Stop Using ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas”, suggesting that “Maybe the Advertising World Has Used This Poem Enough”. He or she then proceeds to prove his or her point by assembling a virtual cornucopia of advertising campaigns based on the ditty.
There’s WestJet and Build-a-Bear. There’s Target and ESPN and Pier One. There’s Best Buy, Old Navy and Golden Circle Ford. Come Toys R Us, come MYPackage, and Keyless Lock. Come Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen – as long as you have the goods, of course, we have the money.
Naturally, no pious objection to any of this moves the immoveable object that is retail capitalism at Christmastime.
Witness the Marriott Hotel chain’s Holiday specials, presented faithfully under the rubric “‘Twas The Night Before Christmas is all winter long, available November 15, 2013 to January 5, 2014.”
Indeed, dear reader, “enjoy the following winter salon treatments that all include our sweet coconut Sugar Scrub and other invigorating winter scents like vanilla and ginger coconut. . .Gingerbread manicure, 25 minutes, $55. . .Treat your hands to the ultimate in hydration. . .Warm up those tootsies with this seasonal pedicure featuring a vanilla spice soak, coconut sugar scrub and coconut body butter with ginger essential oil. . .Come in from the cold this winter and enjoy a hand conditioning treatment. Nails are filed and shine buffed, coconut milk is applied to hands and forearms, followed by a coconut ginger sugar scrub, nourishing coconut ginger body butter, and completed with a hot paraffin treatment. . .Feet retreat, 30 minutes, $65.”
Or, perhaps, merely drop in on yuksrus.com to view the ultimate post-modern insult (funny, though it is):
‘Twas the night before Christmas and poor Clement Moore
Had his poem being copied by many a bore
His “Night Before Christmas” is perfect in rhyme
His rhythm and cadence are wonderfully fine.
But then come the wise guys, with Internet cool
Who use Clement’s rhyme as sort of a tool
They pick up the style from this poem of “that night”
And they hitch up their sled to whatever’s their gripe.
Thanks for that, L. Daniel Quinn. You kind of make my point.

New Brunswick gets it right on drug plan
Three years ago, David Alward made catastrophic drug coverage one of the linchpins of his election campaign. The other was capping the Harmonized Sales Tax at 13 per cent. Thus began, perhaps, the premier’s complicated relationship with what economists term “inputs and outputs.”
Specifically, one actually needs to raise revenue before one increases spending or one tends to go broke pretty darn quickly.
Most householders in New Brunswick get this simple arithmetic. A $500-million annual deficit and a $11-billion long-term debt against the province’s accounts suggest that our elected lawmakers are not as perspicacious as the people they represent.
Still, every so often, a case can be made for a spending program in the absence of a new and ready source of revenue to cover its costs – especially when the administration of such a program will likely prevent the state’s extensive financial hemorrhaging in the future.
Indeed, such a case can be made for the Tory government’s comprehensive drug plan, announced last week, and its specific codicils for catastrophic prescription coverage. Apart from opposition Liberals in the legislature, most interested groups in the province seem sanguine about what they observe in the fine print, which splits the cost of the $50-million (per annum) plan almost evenly between consumers and the Province.
“We’re pleased to see this happening – it’s a moment in history for New Brunswick health care,” Anne McTiernan, CEO of the Canadian Cancer Society in New Brunswick, told the Telegraph-Journal last week. “It will make a huge difference on a go-forward basis for New Brunswickers. It will address both the financial barriers for people accessing important drugs.”
Added Barbara MacKinnon, president and CEO of the New Brunswick Lung Association, for the same piece: “This is an excellent plan. Although it is going to cost, it is really going to keep people out of the hospital. . .If you can get the right diagnosis, the right prescription drug plan, then you are not going to have a stroke.”
In fact, this plan is not likely to financially hobble anyone – not the province which is, arguably, already on skid row, or individuals whose premiums have been scaled to their incomes.
According to the Department of Health, “For individuals earning a gross income of $26,360 or less and families earning a gross income of $49,389 or less, the premium will be approximately $67 per month per adult ($800 per year). For individuals earning a gross income between $26,361 and $50,000 and families earning a gross income of between $49,390 and $75,000, the premium will be approximately $117 per month per adult ($1,400 per year). For individuals earning a gross income between $50,001 and $75,000 and families earning a gross income of between $75,001 and $100,000, the premium will be $133 per month per adult ($1,600 per year). For individuals earning a gross income of more than $75,001 and families earning a gross income of more than $100,001, the premium will be $167 per month per adult ($2,000 per year).”
Meanwhile, “Children 18 and younger will not pay premiums but a parent will have to be enrolled in the plan. All plan members will be required to pay a 30-per-cent co-pay at the pharmacy up to $30 per prescription.”
There’s even a bone or two tossed to the approximately 80 per cent of New Brusnwickers who hold private drug coverage, to wit: “From May 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015, some New Brunswickers who have private drug plans but still incur high drug costs or need access to a drug covered under the new plan but not through their private plan may join the New Brunswick Drug Plan.”
After that, the province mandates that all private group drug plans “must be at least as comprehensive as the New Brunswick Drug Plan.” That means they must provide comparable coverage in terms of prescriptions and costs.
It has taken three years to craft a program that make sense. But, as Health Minister Hugh Flemming points out, if it’s the right plan, it’s worth the wait.

The political art of fomenting depression
What’s perplexing about the David Alward government’s decision to spend a few thousand taxpayer bucks on TV ads showing New Brunswickers mourning the state of their province’s economy is not that it reflects poorly on our lawmakers’ vision of the future.
What’s perplexing is that our lawmakers seem to believe it reflects well on their own political fortunes.
Less than a year before the general election, the Tories are bringing up the rear in popular opinion. Poll after poll suggests that if the ballot were held today, they’d lose to Brian Gallant’s Liberals by a wide margin.
This somehow impels the big brains who occupy the small offices reserved for government communications to remind New Brunswickers in convincing fashion, and just before the holidays, that the past three-plus years in office have been an unmitigated disaster for the Progressive Conservatives.
The ads show various men and women, who are presumably en route to the oil-black and money-green pastures of western Canada, hanging out on tarmacks and in airport departure lounges, their brows appropriately furrowed.
“I’ve been going for four years,” says one.
“We haven’t got enough opportunities here, we have to go do it out west,” says another.
Finally, up pops the kicker, accompanied by a stern-sounding VoiceOver: “This message is brought to you by the Government of New Brunswick.”
Now, we witness the game, if untried, Mr. Gallant mumbling under his breath and, indeed, over it: “Thank you, Mr. Alward, you just made my day.”
Of course, in the local media, he sounds more like this:
“New Brunswickers don’t need an ad to tell them that there aren’t enough jobs in New Brunswick. This is an ad that is virtually discouraging people to stay and invest in New Brunswick. It’s even demoralizing.”
To which, Premier Alward retorts, “Every day there are families that are living with separation and we believe there are good options long term to see our economy be stronger, our province be stronger, and our people be able to decide to be here and build their communities here. . .It’s a message to all New Brunswickers that we need to be saying yes to allow development to take place.”
Well. . .no, actually.
It is a message to all New Brunswickers that they are at death’s doorstep, and that their only salvation is via the kool aid of shale gas development, which may or not be true. (It’s too early to know anything with certainty).
What I do know, from my years in the marketing communications and advertising industry (I call them my “lucrative” epoch), is that scaring the bejesus out of people is guaranteed to produce only one, durable response: shoot the messenger.
Again, Mr. Alward, Mr. Gallant thanks you.
What’s intriguing about all of this is just how unnecessary it is.
The Alward government holds all the cards in the shale gas industry deck. Its regulations for development are, purportedly, the toughest in North America. It has the benefit of knowing all the best and worst practices. It even has a scientific panel, convened to guide its decisions (though only The Almighty knows when this efficacious advice will be forthcoming).
What’s more, its foes on this file are, though vocal, largely in the minority.
If it truly wants to win the hearts and minds of the majority, why doesn’t it produce ads that speak directly to the issue – spots that fight the fictions swirling around shale gas with facts?
Why not emphasize the positive attributes of an industry that, properly regulated, could help transform the province’s economy – thanks to the money it will generate for public coffers – into an incubator of commercially viable innovations in sectors not specifically related to resource extraction?
Those who argue that the provincial government has no business using public dollars to promote its economic agenda are, among other things, on the wrong side of history. Governments do this sort of thing all the time. In fact, we expect it of them, especially when they don’t do it. What is tourism, except a giant public-sector promotion campaign?
This Tory reign has staked its mandate on transforming the New Brunswick economy through its responsible stewardship of natural resources. Its most recent ad campaign, however, indicates that it has not yet learned how best communicate this otherwise clear and simple message.
Meanwhile, as goes its mandate, so goes any chance New Brunswick has of seizing its future for its now-departing citizens.

Politicians say the darndest things
If only fatheads could float far away
They don’t really mean the nonsense that, so often, trips off their tongues. They just libel can’t help themselves. Theirs is less an affliction than an occupational hazard. It comes with the territory upon which the politician must trod, oh so publicly, every day.
We shan’t soon forget this beauty, courtesy of former U.S. President George W. Bush, circa 2004:
“Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.”
Nor can we let current U.S. President Barack Obama off the hook for this campaign trail blooper some years ago: “I’ve now been in 57 states – I think I have one left to go.”
There’s the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan on the environment: “Trees cause more pollution than automobiles do.”
There’s U.S. Congressman Joe Barton on wind energy:
“Wind is God’s way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it’s hotter to areas where it’s cooler. That’s what wind is. Wouldn’t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up?
There’s former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on being gay: “In Iran, we don’t have homosexuals, like in your country.”
There’s former U.S. Representative Todd Akin on pregnancy resulting from sexual assault: “It seems to me, first of all, from what I understand from doctors that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”
There’s Canada’s former Minister of Public Safety on an opposition MP who criticized new government legislation designed to fight online pedophilia: “We are proposing measures to bring our laws into the 21st century and to provide the police with the lawful tools that they need. . .He can either stand with us or with the child pornographers.”
Now we witness Toronto Mayor (in name only) Rob Ford throw his hat into the arena with what is clearly a litigious attack on Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale, who has returned fire with a libel notice.
Mr. Ford’s remark in an interview with Conrad Black on The Zoomer TV show earlier this month was, verbatim: “Daniel Dale in my backyard taking pictures. I have little kids. When a guy’s taking pictures of little kids, I don’t want to say the word, but you start thinking, you know, what’s this guy all about?”
To which Mr. Dale’s lawyers responded, “This is a vicious libel of Mr. Dale. In its plain and ordinary meaning, Rob Ford is calling Mr. Dale a pedophile. . .This letter shall constitute notice under section 5(1) of Ontario’s Libel and Slander Act. . .ZoomerMedia and Rob Ford should immediately retract the false and defamatory statements in their entirety, and apologize to Mr. Dale – publicly, abjectly, unreservedly and completely – if they wish to even begin to undo the harm caused by the broadcast of Mr. Ford’s outrageous statements.”
Yeah, good luck with that.
Methinks Mr. Ford, who has admitted to smoking crack cocaine and being outrageously drunk in public and, yet, remains technically in office, believes his skin in made of teflon. And maybe it is.
Maybe that is the secret of public office: Regularly say the the most ludicrous things you can imagine and, pretty soon, people become inured to your absurdity.
Conversely, when a smart, articulate guy says something just a wee bit silly, the remark stands out.
Here’s New Brunswick Liberal MLA Don Arseneault critiquing the new Tory drug plan for the province last week: “If a single mother or anybody in New Brunswick misses a payment – maybe because of being out of the country or being in the hospital or just not being able to make ends meet – the government is going to multiply that fine by the number of days and the person can be fined up to $5,200. . .Do you think that is right?”
To which Health Minister Ted Flemming replied, “Any person who is in need is not going to be paying under this plan. . .To suggest that New Brusnwickers are a bunch of people who are not going to p[ay their bills is an insult. . .and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”
Careful, fellows. . .You are heading dangerously close to Rob Ford territory, where nonsense is a way of life.

For individuals earning a gross income between $50,001 and $75,000 and families earning a gross income of between $75,001 and $100,000, the premium will be $133 per month per adult ($1,600 per year).

Protecting Hardworking Taxpayers and Getting Our Fiscal House in Order
The current budget deficit, created by generations of lawmakers in Washington, is a serious problem that did not get created overnight and will not get solved overnight either. But by working together, we can take commonsense steps that will move our country in the right direction.
Like so many across our district, I learned at a young age that balancing the family pocketbook and living within our means is a question of values. I believe that what we cannot do is balance the federal budget on the backs of middle class families, seniors, students and veterans while cutting taxes for big oil companies, corporations that ship our jobs overseas and millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street.
What we can, and should do, is start by rooting out instances of government waste, fraud and abuse so that we can strengthen Medicare and expand Social Security.
That’s why as my first piece of legislation, I introduced the Government Waste Reduction Act, a common sense bill that would reduce duplicative services and root out waste in government, while preserving crucial services and programs. And in 2015, I introduced and passed The Improper Payments Coordination Act to save taxpayer dollars by utilizing 21st century data analytics to eliminate improper payments and rein in waste and fraud across federal agencies.
There’s still a lot of work ahead to get Washington in order, but I’m committed to using my watchdog role in Congress to protect hardworking taxpayers.

Almost Half Of US Families Can’t Afford Basics Like Rent And Food
18-5-2018 Sacramento CBS 10 64
(CNN Money) — The economy may be chugging along, but many Americans are still struggling to afford a basic middle-class life.
Nearly 51 million households don’t earn enough to afford a monthly budget that includes housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone, according to a study released Thursday by the United Way ALICE Project. That’s 43% of households in the United States.
Related: Unemployment is below 4% for the first time since 2000
The figure includes the 16.1 million households living in poverty, as well as the 34.7 million families that the United Way has dubbed ALICE — Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. This group makes less than what’s needed “to survive in the modern economy.”
“Despite seemingly positive economic signs , the ALICE data shows that financial hardship is still a pervasive problem,” said Stephanie Hoopes, the project’s director.
Related: How Joe Biden would fix income inequality in America
California, New Mexico and Hawaii have the largest share of struggling families, at 49% each. North Dakota has the lowest at 32%.
Many of these folks are the nation’s child care workers, home health aides, office assistants and store clerks, who work low-paying jobs and have little savings, the study noted. Some 66% of jobs in the US pay less than $20 an hour.
The study also drilled down to the county level.
For instance, in Seattle’s King County, the annual household survival budget for a family of four (including one infant and one preschooler) in 2016 was nearly $85,000. This would require an hourly wage of $42.46. But in Washington State, only 14% of jobs pay more than $40 an hour.
Related: Seattle passes a smaller version of the ‘Amazon tax’
Seattle’s City Council just passed a controversial tax on big businesses to help alleviate the city’s growing homelessness and affordable housing problems.

Although considerable security, political, and economic progress has been made in Afghanistan, much remains to be done to attain long-term stability and extinguish the Taliban insurgency. In this respect, while the conflict in Afghanistan is no longer consistently in the public eye, it remains of great importance to the United States. Going forward, U.S. policy should aim to protect the integrity of the Afghan state and, toward that end, attempt to end the conflict in ways that mitigate the threats of terrorism, instability, and conflict in the region.
The Current Situation
The security environment in Afghanistan is still precarious, evidenced by the uptick in violence in 2016 and the diminishing government control in rural areas.
Factions of the Government of National Unity remain divided, and a corrupt patronage system continues to impede reform.
Economic growth has shrunk since the drawdown of international forces, while the government remains heavily dependent on foreign aid.
Afghan-Pakistani relations have frayed due to widening differences on security at a time when regional competition in and over Afghanistan persists.
The United States’ willingness to indefinitely subsidize Afghanistan with some $23 billion per year is uncertain, especially when al-Qaeda’s core has been reduced to incoherence.
However, the combination of a weakening Afghan regime and an unchecked Taliban resurgence could lead to the catastrophic collapse of the Afghan government and state, resulting in either a return to anarchy or the recrudescence of terrorist groups.
The Paths Ahead
The United States needs to develop a strategy that protects the gains in Afghanistan while terminating the conflict.
Regional options—resolving the India-Pakistan conflict, creating a neutral Afghanistan, or squeezing Pakistan—are too difficult to rely on alone.
Unilateral options—either pursuing major escalation or a complete disengagement—are equally implausible because of their high costs and risks, respectively.
Only limited approaches—moderately expanding the current commitment, seeking a political settlement, or fostering a long-term counterterrorism partnership—are left. Since a counterterrorism-only solution is unlikely to be efficacious, the United States should prioritize reaching a political settlement with the Taliban while continuing to bolster the Afghan state and its security forces.
To be successful, Washington will need to empower the U.S. ambassador in Kabul to oversee the administration’s entire strategy in Afghanistan; persuade the Afghan government to begin a serious national dialogue on political reconciliation; engage in direct talks with the Taliban; target the Taliban shura, if necessary, while inducing Rawalpindi to constrain the Taliban’s sanctuary in Pakistan; and secure regional support for a political settlement in Afghanistan.

The conflict in Afghanistan is the United States’ longest-running war by nearly six years. Approximately 10,000 U.S. troops, and more than twice as many U.S. contractors, remain deployed in this war-torn state.1 Despite all the burdens borne, the United States and its allies have made considerable progress. The two-decades-long war that followed the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had resulted in the comprehensive destruction of its state institutions, armed forces, and national economy. Today, the Afghan state has been reconstituted, Afghan security forces have once again become a national institution, and the economy continues to enable human development improvements while experiencing slow but positive growth. Further, fifteen years after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, U.S. and allied (including Afghan) forces have dismantled, for the most part, the terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan that attacked the U.S. homeland on that fateful day.
U.S. choices about its future involvement in the country remain arguably the most crucial external factor in the evolution of both the conflict and the Afghan state.
However, significant barriers remain to securing long-term stability and prosperity in the country: the political system is marked by deep cleavages; governance is handicapped by corruption and an inability to deliver law, order, and justice across the entire territory; the Afghan military as a whole is still not effective enough against a resilient Taliban insurgency; and the economy remains dependent on large infusions of foreign aid rather than indigenous sources of growth. These internal challenges, coupled with external pressures—the persistence of deepening Afghan-Pakistani animosity, the prevalence of ongoing regional rivalries in and over Afghanistan, and the potential for donor fatigue as the Afghan conflict continues interminably—could each and together lead to the unraveling of the security, political, and economic gains chalked up since 2001. Should such reversals lead to a tipping point, the survival of the Kabul government, if not the Afghan state itself, could be at serious risk.
This precarious state of affairs suggests that the United States and its allies—who together contribute more than $5 billion annually in civilian assistance to Kabul2—have to make important decisions on how best to support Afghanistan going forward. In fact, U.S. choices about its future involvement in the country remain arguably the most crucial external factor in the evolution of both the conflict and the Afghan state. Based on an internal assessment that his strategy was slow in generating progress, if not altogether faltering, former president Barack Obama jettisoned his long-standing goal of ending the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan during his tenure and chose instead to leave crucial decisions about future U.S. aims and the means for achieving them up to his successor. Donald Trump’s administration is undertaking a review of these issues, and it is likely that policy decisions regarding troop levels and the course of future U.S. involvement in Afghanistan will be announced soon. However, given the challenges facing this White House’s national security team and the time pressures of announcing a decision at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) summit in Brussels on May 25, 2017, it is unclear whether the present audit will be comprehensive enough.
An independent effort to assess U.S. strategy in Afghanistan could accordingly prove useful, and this paper is intended to explore the fundamental strategic choices facing the United States. While the issues related to troop levels and the character of military operations are undoubtedly important, these are properly the province of government. Thus, the focus here is on scrutinizing the larger aims of future U.S. and allied involvement in Afghanistan and the policy approaches that could achieve them—not on the minutiae entailed by the alternatives.
Afghanistan’s Continuing Travails
The future of U.S. policy toward Afghanistan cannot be effectively assessed without a closer examination of Afghanistan’s current and evolving security, political, and economic landscapes—and their impact on U.S. strategic aims. There is a broad consensus among observers of Afghanistan today that (1) the security environment in rural areas is deteriorating while the urban areas and their lines of communication remain secure despite a growing Taliban threat; (2) the political situation at the national level is poor but relatively stable, although the pervasive corruption in governmental institutions continues to take a toll on the regime’s effectiveness and legitimacy; and (3) economic conditions are difficult—with growth rates contracting as a result of the reduced foreign troop levels in country—and are unlikely to substantially or rapidly improve.

There is no debate that Afghanistan is experiencing a continuing downturn in security with more than 40 percent of its districts either under Taliban control or influence or in contest.3 In February 2017, General John W. Nicholson, the four-star commander of the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the conflict in Afghanistan reflected a “stalemate.”4 The 2016 “fighting season” prevented a repeat of strategic setbacks, such as the Taliban’s takeover of Kunduz in 2015. However, the 2017 fighting season began with one of the most lethal attacks in the war, when ten Taliban fighters killed more than 150 Afghan soldiers and civilians after infiltrating an army base near Mazar-e-Sharif.5 Pessimists highlight the nonlinear nature of this struggle, the ability of the Taliban to make gains in areas where they enjoy no ethnic advantages, and the possibility of accelerated deterioration without notice or warning. Optimists point to the Afghan National Army, which has remained engaged in fighting despite suffering heavy losses; the Afghan Special Forces, which have proven themselves to be extraordinarily competent despite suffering from overextension; and widespread support for the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in part because of President Ashraf Ghani’s tireless efforts to enhance their morale and national standing. In contrast, the Taliban appear to be confident about their military position, yet lack the assurance of being able to secure the victories that permitted them to enjoy the near monopoly of power they had achieved in the 1990s—a consequence of both the complexities of Afghan domestic politics and the continued international support for the ANSF and the Afghan state.6
Regardless of how the security situation is assessed, the persistence of the Taliban insurgency is perhaps still the most debilitating challenge facing the country.
Regardless of how the security situation is assessed, the persistence of the Taliban insurgency is perhaps still the most debilitating challenge facing the country; despite the expensive and concerted efforts of the United States, its international allies, and the Afghans themselves, it is far from being extinguished. According to the United Nations, with more than 11,000 civilians killed or wounded, 2016 was the most violent year in Afghanistan since 2009 when reporting began.7 The ANSF, too, suffered extraordinarily high casualties, with 6,785 killed and an additional 11,777 wounded between January and November 2016.8 Notwithstanding the valiant efforts represented by such losses, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has reported that the Afghan government today controls less than 60 percent of the country when measured by area and a little more than 60 percent of the country when measured by population.9 Although the majority of the population still remains under government control or influence, the Taliban appear to be gaining traction thanks to poor local governance and service provision, an accessible safe haven in Pakistan, continuing weaknesses in the ANSF’s combat support capabilities, and the operational limitations of many ANSF components outside of the special forces.
In contrast, the internal political situation in Afghanistan at the highest level of state is generally stable, notwithstanding the disappointing performance of the Government of National Unity (GNU) as the salvaged outcome of the 2014 presidential election. Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah have yet to put aside their rivalry. They remain divided over appointments—often splitting along patronage lines—as well as over electoral and power-sharing issues. However, the two leaders’ policy differences—for instance, over support for a continued international presence and engagement with Pakistan—are comparatively few. Whatever its weaknesses, the GNU’s endurance has confounded those who predicted its collapse, and it arguably remains preferable to many other alternatives.
As a result of lagging reform, the basis for political legitimacy in Afghanistan remains an atavistic patronage system, fueled in large part by U.S. and international funding.
As a result of lagging reform, the basis for political legitimacy in Afghanistan remains an atavistic patronage system, fueled in large part by U.S. and international funding. In addition, governance remains highly centralized, with district and provincial governors appointed from Kabul. As a result, corruption remains ubiquitous despite Ghani’s commitment to an anticorruption agenda. Troublingly, the Taliban have exploited the fragility and ineffectiveness of the GNU, offering a more agile form of local governance with a reputation, deserved or not, for being less prone to corruption.
Afghanistan’s economy has contracted significantly with the reduction in the international presence, resulting in a recession and less than 1 percent economic growth in 2015.10 While growth is projected to rise to 2.4 percent in 2017 and exceed 3 percent by 2019, such performance hinges on both political stability and an improved security environment. Even at such levels of accomplishment, however, government spending is deficit-financed despite nearly all security costs and half of the nonsecurity expenditures’ being funded by the international community. The longer-term opportunities for sustained growth in Afghanistan have not yet come to fruition. For example, the country is admittedly rich in natural resources—especially metals such as iron, copper, gold, cobalt, rare earth metals, and lithium—but without internal stability and a durable legal regime that effectively regulates mining, the extractive industries that could contribute to the national exchequer have not matured.
Regional trade has been another victim of both the civil war and geopolitics. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA)—vital to Afghanistan as a land-locked country—is still too limited to be transformative. The agreement does not include India, the largest regional market; the administrative barriers to bilateral trade are still extensive; and the new China-Pakistan Economic Corridor potentially weakens the promise of the APTTA even further, leaving Afghanistan with fewer opportunities than is desirable.
U.S. Interests and Objectives in Afghanistan
The preceding assessment leaves little doubt that Afghanistan confronts serious challenges in all areas of national life. Although the country has been successfully revitalized after decades of war—an outcome aided greatly by more U.S. assistance to Kabul than was extended to Europe under the Marshall Plan after the Second World War—the question of whether such support can be extended on an ongoing basis will depend greatly on the worth of U.S. interests and aims in Afghanistan. Recognizing that the threats emerging from Afghanistan have changed considerably since Congress authorized the use of military force in 2001, it is reasonable to evaluate the extent to which the original objectives have been achieved and, if not, whether these objectives remain valid.
The unprecedented trauma of the September 11 attacks prompted the U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan, which was intended to decimate al-Qaeda and its protectors “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations, or persons.”11 As a result of unrelenting U.S. and allied military operations since then, the core of al-Qaeda has been dismantled to the point of incoherence. Despite this achievement, however, the extremist ideology embodied by al-Qaeda persists across a more diffuse movement, and there are residual fears that the resurgent Taliban insurgency could reestablish a sanctuary for transnational terrorist successors to al-Qaeda, such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State, as well as formidable regional terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which could provoke major crises involving local nuclear-armed powers India and Pakistan (or even threaten the United States itself should LeT choose to operate further afield).
Permanently eliminating the possibility of such a sanctuary constituted the core objective of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan in the immediate aftermath of September 11. This aim had originally mandated the defeat of the Taliban, but as success on this count proved elusive, U.S. strategy evolved by 2010 to focus on transitioning the conflict’s resolution to be an Afghan responsibility, with Washington underwriting its financial costs. Given Afghanistan’s poor infrastructure, its weaknesses in state capacity, and the intensity of the insurgency, the other initial aim of stabilizing Afghanistan—through robust economic development and transformed governance—was increasingly seen as infeasible by the beginning of Obama’s second term. By the end of his presidency, both the open-ended conflict with the Taliban and Washington’s prolonged financial commitment to Kabul became suspect.
U.S. policy going forward should aim to protect the integrity of the Afghan state and, toward that end, attempt to end the hostilities with the Taliban on acceptable terms and in ways that mitigate the threats of terrorism, instability, and conflict in the region.
President Donald Trump thus inherited a U.S. policy toward Afghanistan that was focused on building Afghan security forces while maintaining a modest unilateral counterterrorism capability against transnational threats. Obama’s original strategy sought to complete the withdrawal of all U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan by 2014. Since it turned out, however, that the ANSF proved incapable of independently holding territory against the Taliban, prolonging the presence of U.S. combat forces in the country was viewed as necessary. Effectively, then, Obama opted to let his successor determine the future of the 9,800-strong U.S. troop contingent in Afghanistan.12 Whether to build up or further reduce the force fell to the Trump administration, but the viability of Obama’s own temporizing solution was unclear: the deployed U.S. detachment is costly to maintain in absolute terms and is large enough to be perceived by the Taliban as an occupying entity, yet it is insufficient to decisively change the course of the struggle on Afghanistan’s battlefield.
Despite these challenges, Afghanistan as a foreign policy issue—or as a national security priority—was seldom raised during the 2016 presidential campaign. Further, in his February 28, 2017, address to a joint session of Congress, Trump mentioned neither the conflict nor the country, and his national security cabinet nominees were scarcely asked about Afghanistan during their confirmation hearings.
Afghanistan’s absence from the political center stage obviously reflects the crowded and more complex foreign policy landscape that currently exists—encompassing difficulties that eclipse those faced during the U.S. intervention after September 11, 2001. In this climate, the Trump administration now has the responsibility to reject or modify the view of its predecessor and take a new approach to Afghanistan. Whatever the course of action it chooses to pursue, the worthiness of the strategy will be judged on how well it incorporates the lessons learned from the campaign thus far and whether it stands a reasonable chance of achieving the United States’ desired aims.
The challenge facing Washington and its international partners in this context is defining realistic goals for Afghanistan that continue to effectively ward off the worst dangers while permitting the consolidation of gains already achieved. Because much has already been accomplished in Afghanistan—though much also remains at risk—U.S. policy going forward should aim to protect the integrity of the Afghan state and, toward that end, attempt to end the hostilities with the Taliban on acceptable terms and in ways that mitigate the threats of terrorism, instability, and conflict in the region.
Current Regional Perceptions of the Afghan Conflict
Afghanistan: Afghan political elites lament what they see as a dissolving regional consensus on Afghanistan, with powers like China, Iran, and Russia beginning to hedge against perceptions of an ascendant Taliban. By and large, Afghans agree on the need for reconciliation as a consequence of their growing fatigue with conflict. Based on a recent survey, approximately 63 percent of Afghans support a peace process as a means of stabilizing the country—although fewer people report sympathies with the armed opposition groups and more people see them as exploiting power rather than seeking to influence Afghan politics.13 The Afghan government continues to hold out hope that reconciliation with the Taliban might be possible, but it perceives Pakistan to be the principal spoiler in this regard. Relations between Kabul and Islamabad have soured since the failure of the Quadrilateral Coordination Group peace process, an effort led by Pakistan to spur talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban and supported by the United States and China as observers.14 Ghani invested early political capital in this process, against the odds, and his inability to deliver has left him politically exposed and hardened against Islamabad. Given the uncertain future of reconciliation, Afghanistan desperately seeks a resolute U.S. commitment to Afghanistan to provide economic and diplomatic support, as well as assistance for Afghan national security forces through continued training, the supply of more advanced weapons, and the provision of combat support.
Pakistan: Pakistan continues to believe that only a negotiated settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan government will end the war in Afghanistan, since it has no faith that the United States will muster the commitment and resources to defeat the insurgency militarily. Many Pakistani officials, civilian and military, contend that even if Washington were sufficiently resolute, the Taliban are unlikely to be conclusively defeated.15 In any event, Pakistan appears determined to preserve the sanctuary that the Taliban’s leadership—the Quetta Shura—enjoys on its territory, despite the Pakistan Army’s continued effort to convince Afghanistan and the international community that it has abandoned its former policy of allowing for a distinction between the “good” and “bad” Taliban. Pakistan’s rationale for effectively sheltering the Taliban leadership is complex: whether it seeks to compel an Afghan acceptance of the Durand Line as the permanent Afghan-Pakistani border, whether it desires a hedge against either a too-close Afghan-Indian partnership or an overly hasty U.S. exit from Afghanistan, or whether it strives for influence inside the Afghan government in a postconflict settlement, Rawalpindi seems to believe that protecting the Quetta Shura could advance its interests on all these counts. The Pakistani conviction that India’s true objectives in Afghanistan lie in promoting Baluch separatism and anti-Pakistani militancy in the frontier areas only intensifies its resolve to protect what it sees as its core national security interests.
India: India blames the perpetuation of the Afghan conflict entirely on Pakistan’s uncompromising support for the Taliban. In New Delhi’s eyes, the Taliban may represent a genuine Afghan protest against the Kabul central government post–September 11, 2001, but its endurance is entirely due to Pakistani support that is intended to coerce Afghanistan even as Rawalpindi plays a double game with the United States—accepting U.S. assistance in targeting transnational terrorism while effectively shielding the Taliban. In these circumstances, India sees its nonsecurity assistance to Afghanistan as helping to stabilize the country, demonstrating solidarity with the larger international effort, and assisting a weaker Kabul in standing up to a stronger Islamabad. Successive Indian governments have encouraged the United States to steadfastly prosecute the military campaign in Afghanistan. India contends that it will support whatever the Afghan government chooses in regard to reconciliation, as long as Kabul is not coerced, the integration of the Taliban takes place through a constitutional process, and all sections of Afghan society are comfortable with the terms of reconciliation. Since New Delhi judges that these conditions do not yet exist, it strongly supports current U.S. and Afghan military operations to prevent the Taliban from being able to negotiate from a position of strength.
China: China stepped up its engagement with Afghanistan in 2011 based on a perception that the United States was likely to leave the country before its situation was stabilized. Nonetheless, China’s interests in Afghanistan remain a relatively low priority and are focused mainly on mitigating the risk to stability in western China and to its Belt and Road Initiative. The broader Chinese policy of regional noninterference has resulted in Beijing’s taking a hands-off approach to the most difficult problems of peace and order in Afghanistan. It has relied on the United States to manage these challenges, while it focuses on exploiting the modest economic opportunities that Afghanistan may offer over the long term. China’s long-standing, all-weather relationship with Pakistan, however, has placed it in a position of opposing any initiatives that come at the expense of Pakistan’s interests. It has, for example, been far more sympathetic to Islamabad’s approach to counterterrorism than Afghanistan, India, and the United States have been; and it will continue to promote reconciliation terms that closely mirror Pakistan’s own preferences while in the near term encouraging the development of a regional consensus on opposition to the Islamic State.
Russia: Given the perceived failure of the Quadrilateral Coordination Group and the relatively low levels of U.S. engagement in the current reconciliation process, Russia has begun facilitating a significant regional dialogue on Afghanistan. Its April 2017 meeting, which the United States declined to attend, convened eleven nations.16 Russia has been largely skeptical about the prospects of a U.S. military success in Afghanistan from the very beginning—a view undoubtedly colored by its own experiences in the country. Moscow’s current interest in promoting a political dialogue in Afghanistan, however, is shaped by its expectation that the United States will not remain resolute in its commitment to Afghanistan, especially in the face of supposedly rising threats from the Islamic State in the eastern parts of the country.17 As a consequence, Moscow appears tempted to curry favor with the Taliban, engaging the insurgents as part of its strategy to checkmate the Islamic State and limit the latter’s capacity to expand its operations into Central Asia and eventually Russia itself. Other views of recent Russian actions are less forgiving: some see them as consistent with Russia’s more assertive strategy in Syria, where Moscow effectively intervened in order to back a preferred proxy and contain U.S. influence. In any event, Afghanistan has evoked relatively good cooperation between Washington and Moscow, despite their bilateral relationship deteriorating over the Ukraine crisis. At the moment, Moscow is likely waiting to see how U.S. policy on Russia might shift under the Trump administration.
Iran: Iranian policy on Afghanistan is principally based on hedging against both the Islamic State and U.S. policy toward Tehran. Because of the latter consideration, Iran tacitly supported the Taliban intermittently during the last decade, despite its distaste for the Taliban’s brand of Islam and determined political opposition to them during the late 1990s.18 Since hurting the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan was viewed—particularly by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—as a means of punishing the United States itself, some factions of the Iranian state provided low levels of support for Taliban operations, even though Tehran itself has been supportive of the Afghan state and its U.S.-led reconstruction after the September 11 attacks. As the vanguard of Shia Islam, the Iranian regime has been only mildly less opposed to the Deobandi-inspired Afghan Taliban than it has been to the ideological extremism of Salafi-based groups such as the Islamic State. The Iranians see the latter as part of a Saudi ideological project to counter Shia influence, so they are extremely resistant to Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council involvement in Afghanistan—although this remains a lower priority issue than other concerns, such as narcotics and water rights. In general, Iran is skeptical about U.S. success in Afghanistan, and while it might be willing to accept reconciliation as a solution in Afghanistan, much will depend on the terms and on the power any agreement may bestow on the Taliban.
U.S. Policy Options Going Forward
Given the continuing difficulties, there are a variety of alternative strategies that the United States could pursue in Afghanistan—some obviously better than others—if Washington is to achieve its minimal goal of protecting the Afghan state so as to mitigate the threats of terrorism, instability, and conflict in the region. The options iterated below, based on what frequently surfaces in public discussions, are summarily assessed and categorized with reference to their effectiveness and feasibility in advancing this objective.
Regional Approaches
A Regional Solution to End the Proxy War. If the Afghan conflict is viewed as a consequence of the India-Pakistan rivalry—one that cannot be solved without first engineering a rapprochement between New Delhi and Islamabad (not to mention Rawalpindi)—the United States ought to invest in achieving a permanent South Asian peace (as Richard Holbrooke, former U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, had originally intended). This solution, however, is misconceived: it fails to account for Afghanistan’s own territorial problem with Pakistan—whose roots predate the latter’s dispute with India—and, in any case, is too difficult to achieve in the short term in ways that would improve the current trajectory of the conflict in Afghanistan. Another version of this option is the concept of regional neutrality, wherein Afghanistan gradually exits its current security-based partnerships in favor of implementing a cooperative security agreement signed by all neighbors and near-neighbors. This solution, however, is more implausible than it initially appears, as Kabul—without assistance from Washington—would have difficulty enforcing such an agreement if it were violated by one or more of Afghanistan’s neighbors.
Pressuring of Pakistan to Squeeze the Taliban. This option derives from the view that the war in Afghanistan is perpetuated by the Pakistan Army’s policies—in particular, its search for “strategic depth”—which results in Rawalpindi’s support for a Taliban sanctuary within Pakistan’s borders.19 A solution aimed at pressuring Pakistan would accordingly require Washington to use all its levers of influence, persuasive and coercive, to compel Pakistan to either give up protecting the Taliban leadership or force it to negotiate with Kabul. The logic underlying this solution is straightforward: the history of counterinsurgency campaigns suggests that the presence of a neighboring sanctuary is one of the key factors accounting for either success or failure. Operationalizing this insight in the case of Pakistan, however, is exceptionally difficult, because it requires Washington to convince Rawalpindi to do something that it judges to be against its own interests, even as the United States—given the absence of alternatives such as Iran—remains dependent on Pakistan for the security of its ground and air lines of communication to Afghanistan. Consequently, pressuring Pakistan to squeeze the Taliban can only be part of a larger approach rather than an independent strategy for achieving even the current, more limited, U.S. aims in Afghanistan.
Unilateral Approaches
Major Military Escalation. Akin to what was favored by many U.S. military officers in 2009 during the first Obama term, returning to a fully resourced counterinsurgency campaign that could sufficiently debilitate the Taliban-led insurgency—thus allowing for expanded governmental reach and a security apparatus that could safeguard the state from Taliban remnants—would require a sizeable increase in U.S. and allied military forces deployed to Afghanistan and intensive operations that could last for many more years, if not decades. Such an effort would have to include confronting the Taliban sanctuary in Pakistan far more resolutely than has been the case so far. Whatever the merits of such an effort in the abstract may be, its moment has now passed because of the strong American disenchantment with expensive foreign wars. Moreover, the demands of such a strategy are beyond what the international community can currently organize, and its past failures in shaping the sociopolitical environment in Afghanistan, ending local corruption, and revitalizing good governance suggest that the complementary factors for military success may lie beyond reach as well. These impediments may well be endemic and not simply the result of incompetence. At any rate, even the threat of resurgent Islamist terrorism in Afghanistan today is unlikely to motivate the United States to embark on a major escalation of the conflict when the demands of nation building at home are judged to be far more onerous in comparison.
Complete Disengagement. A strategy of complete withdrawal of military forces along with a sharp diminution of external assistance—gradually or suddenly—represents the polar opposite of major escalation. Such a strategy could be implemented if the administration were to recast its war aims, declare the primary goal of the original U.S. intervention—the evisceration of al-Qaeda—complete, and announce its intention to concentrate on terrorism at U.S. borders and internally, particularly given the homegrown threat. Such an approach, however, is risky because it could result in the catastrophic collapse of the Afghan government and state, leading to either a return to anarchy or the recrudescence of radical groups within the country. Proponents of this option would rather accept this risk than endure the costs of the status quo, given that the current course could produce eventual failure all the same but at a much higher expense. However, because complete disengagement could produce greater threats to the U.S. homeland over time and because path dependency often leads to an organic preference for the status quo, the administration is unlikely to countenance this course of action without some assurance of either a prospective political settlement or the option to quickly return to counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan should circumstances demand it.
Limited Approaches
Political Settlement. A strategy of seeking a political settlement in Afghanistan would require the United States to more concertedly pursue what it has not yet done: protecting the Afghan state and the gains achieved since September 11, 2001, by actively pursuing reconciliation with the Afghan Taliban in order to integrate them into the Afghan political system and thereby end the current civil war. It is conceivable, although it is not yet proven, that this approach could maintain and secure U.S. interests vis-à-vis transnational terrorist groups, whose relationships with the Taliban range from breakable (al-Qaeda) to opposing (Islamic State), as well as other regional terrorist organizations (LeT) that could precipitate major crises. Achieving this objective would require the United States to preserve some means of conducting counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, even as it pursues a political settlement with formidable operational challenges.
Status Quo Plus. This approach assumes that the current strategy is generally effective but requires more time and some material reinforcement. Pursuing this approach would entail a modest expansion in the U.S. troop presence in terms of both its overall numbers and authorities, especially in regard to permitting greater combat support for the ANSF; increased pressure on Pakistan to eliminate the insurgent sanctuary; continued financial support for the Afghan government and its security forces; ongoing encouragement of the Afghan state’s political, governance, and economic reforms; and opportunistic engagement with the Taliban in pursuit of reconciliation if and when conditions prove propitious. The status quo plus approach, in essence, would reinforce all the current international lines of effort vis-à-vis Afghanistan to enable further strengthening of the Afghan state and to allow new opportunities for success as time goes by.
Enduring Counterterrorism Partnership. The third limited option could be developing a long-term, open-ended partnership with Kabul focused predominantly, if not solely, on the United States’ primary issue of concern: counterterrorism. In this scenario, U.S. Special Operations Forces would continue to target global and regional terrorist groups from permanent U.S. bases inside Afghanistan. But, under this strategy, the United States would reduce all its other investments—military, economic, and diplomatic—for rebuilding the Afghan state, offering to the state only those benefits that arise from either the limited U.S. counterterrorism presence or the efforts aimed at targeting common enemies, including the Taliban. This strategic choice, obviously, would reduce the overall financial burdens of engagement with Afghanistan, except for those costs associated with sustaining the permanent, counterterrorism military presence, most likely at the Bagram air base.
Assessing the Strategies
No extended analysis is required to conclude that neither regional nor unilateral approaches alone would satisfy U.S. strategic interests at this juncture. No regional or unilateral strategy by itself would be sufficient to protect and strengthen the Afghan state either through conflict termination or a successful counterinsurgency effort.
The regional strategies are simply too difficult, too lengthy, too indirect, and too unpredictable, even if Washington were to invest heavily in them. For example, Islamabad has strong incentives to protect the Taliban in order to secure leverage over Kabul while simultaneously having the capacity to resist U.S. pressure as a result of Washington’s dependence on Islamabad for connectivity to Afghanistan. The only solutions that potentially could sever this Gordian Knot are a U.S. surrender to Pakistan, permitting its proxies free rein in Afghanistan at Kabul’s expense, or a confrontation with Pakistan by all means necessary, including military force. The former remedy would likely provoke a major regional crisis involving many of Afghanistan’s neighbors, whereas the latter would involve armed clashes between the United States and Pakistan. The different risks inherent in each solution, therefore, make them unlikely to be the preferred courses of action in Washington.
The unilateral approaches are just as problematic for other reasons. Today, there is little appetite in the United States for a major escalation in Afghanistan when it appears that much of the transnational threat from within the country has been diminished or displaced by homegrown dangers. The Taliban is undoubtedly viewed as a distasteful force, but summoning the will and the resources to defeat it militarily through a long, high-intensity counterinsurgency campaign seems beyond what the political climate in the United States can currently bear. Completely disengaging from Afghanistan, however, is equally problematic because it foregoes an opportunity to manage the risks to the homeland, however small they might appear today.
There is, however, an influential group of senior policymakers in the Trump administration who, despite the president’s highly publicized concerns about radical Islam, are inclined toward disengagement because the costs of the Afghan conflict are viewed as prohibitive at a time when the terrorist groups capable of targeting the United States have been marginalized. President Trump himself likely holds such views, if his 2012 remarks about Afghanistan being “a complete and total disaster” are any indication.20 Obviously, it is well recognized that the Taliban’s return to dominance might provide new opportunities for resuscitating inveterate enemies of the United States, but the issue boils down to the high costs of sustaining a campaign against a political foe that is unlikely to directly target the U.S. homeland and whether a more effective—and cheaper—strategy for protecting the nation can be identified. Because the latter cannot be guaranteed, and also due to the momentum of previous policy choices, those in the administration advocating for continued involvement could carry the day for now, but the larger trend is clear: the United States seems increasingly uncomfortable with spending approximately $23 billion annually—more than $5 billion in aid to Kabul with the remainder in support of U.S. military operations—to support an open-ended conflict.21 Consequently, the search for limited approaches will only grow in intensity over time.
The simplest of the more limited approaches is shifting toward a long-term presence in Afghanistan—one centered on counterterrorism. The advantages of such a posture to the United States are self-evident. Washington would enjoy an enduring presence in Afghanistan, which could be used for continuous targeting of current (and any future) militant groups that might threaten U.S. interests while advancing other U.S. regional objectives in an unsettled part of the world. And it would provide the Afghan state with the psychological benefits of a durable U.S. commitment, which could dissuade the Taliban from believing that they could wait out the U.S. and international presence that justifies spurning current Afghan offers of reconciliation. Moreover, such a posture would be much less costly and perhaps acceptable to those who chafe at the current burdens imposed by the Afghan war on Washington.
However, the disadvantages of this limited strategy are significant. For starters, the narrow focus would mean a sharp reduction in U.S. economic and political assistance, which would further weaken the Afghan government’s capacity to cope with the insurgency—thus making the objective of containing the Taliban even more difficult to achieve. The prospect of a near-permanent U.S. presence in the country, moreover, could further perpetuate the conflict at varying levels of intensity rather than work toward its resolution. These consequences would make a U.S. strategy anchored on pure counterterrorism unappealing for any Afghan government, which would perceive it as bringing major disadvantages for Kabul, whatever the benefits may be for Washington. The fact that a lighter counterterrorism footprint would not suffice to limit any serious Taliban advances—because the Americans committed to this mission would likely remain more focused on force protection rather than concerted terrorism targeting—would only intensify Afghan disenchantment with such an approach. Finally, although a counterterrorism-centered strategy is indeed cheaper than any other limited option, it would not be long before the U.S. political system tired of even such a moderately burdensome commitment if it neither protected the Afghan state effectively nor coped adequately with the terrorist threats in the region. The initial attractiveness of the counterterrorism strategy, therefore, evaporates when tested against the twin demands of credibility and feasibility.
If the foregoing arguments are persuasive, the limited approaches left for the United States in Afghanistan are some modified version of the status quo or a more concerted effort at securing a political settlement. Both strategies have important similarities but also significant differences. The status quo plus approach—which could turn out to be the default approach for the Trump administration if the president sticks to his campaign commitment to keep American troops in Afghanistan even though he would “hate doing it”22—requires a modest injection of additional troops into Afghanistan for an indeterminate duration. The principal mission of all U.S. forces would remain the training of their Afghan counterparts, but the provision of additional authorities would permit U.S. commanders to offer specific assistance in combat support, medical evacuation, and surveillance and targeting when required by Afghan contingents to arrest the loss of territorial control to insurgents.
Overall, this strategy would involve maintaining U.S. commitment to the transition plans agreed to at the 2016 Warsaw NATO Summit: the United States would provide military and economic assistance to Kabul through 2020, after which both its assistance funding and its troop presence would presumably decline. The key distinguishing feature of the status quo plus approach is that even if the current U.S. strategy in Afghanistan has not been entirely successful in defeating the insurgency and building a robust Afghan state, suitably bolstering the current course of action offers opportunities to repair present deficiencies and exploit new opportunities for political and military success. The risks associated with this approach are that the United States could be plowing more resources into a strategy that has not yet borne, and may never bear, full fruit.
The status quo plus approach includes space for seeking a widely acceptable political settlement that might end the conflict with the Taliban. It does not, however, prioritize reconciliation because of the expectation that a negotiated suspension of hostilities is currently implausible. The reluctance to emphasize peace talks is also colored by the fear that an early negotiation will redound to Kabul’s disadvantage if it is undertaken at a time when the current stalemate hurts the Afghan state more than it burdens the Taliban. The format of the existing reconciliation process does not serve to advance the effort either. To begin with, the Afghan government is formally the sole interlocutor with the Taliban, but the latter are contemptuous of Kabul and seek to negotiate only with Washington. Furthermore, Kabul has little incentive to seriously negotiate with the Taliban as long as it is assured continued U.S. economic, political, and military support; this support permits Afghan leaders to delay any efforts at rapprochement in the expectation that prospective military success will strengthen their negotiating hand. Finally, the Taliban sanctuary in Pakistan has made Rawalpindi—backed by Chinese support—a critical intermediary in the reconciliation process, and Pakistani objectives here are far from benign: rather than compelling the Taliban to seek peace with Kabul, thereby bringing the conflict to an end, the Pakistan Army seeks to use the insurgents to extort concessions from the Afghan government to include limitations on cooperation with India and acceptance of what Pakistan sees as its legitimate security interests in Afghanistan.23
A widespread desire to end the war in Afghanistan, however, does not automatically guarantee an acceptable settlement.
Some of these handicaps could be mitigated by making a political settlement a critical line of effort for the first time in U.S. strategy, especially if the Afghan conflict could be resolved in a manner that also secures U.S. counterterrorism interests. A political solution to the conflict in Afghanistan has been discussed for more than a decade, but it has only gained momentum in recent years due to the international community and Afghans becoming increasingly tired of the conflict. In the past, reconciliation suffered because it was an ancillary element of allied strategy, not a purposeful goal. Making it the targeted, rather than incidental, objective of policy going forward may offer promise; the Afghan government’s recent deal with the Hezb-e-Islami militant group provides small but meaningful confidence that a political dialogue is possible.24
A widespread desire to end the war in Afghanistan, however, does not automatically guarantee an acceptable settlement. Success in this regard will require many elements of the status quo plus approach, including continued economic, political, and military assistance to the Afghan government; but these investments must be shaped by the ultimate objective of bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table and achieving a political settlement that is acceptable to all sides in order to protect the Afghan state. This strategy is plausible insofar as the Taliban are already in conflict with the Islamic State, have claimed a willingness to break formally with al-Qaeda, and appear interested in exploring reconciliation on the condition that it eventually results in the exit of all foreign forces from Afghanistan. The obstacles to any meaningful accomplishment, however, cannot be overstated. For starters, it remains to be confirmed that the Taliban’s strategic aims are focused merely on ending the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan as a prelude to peaceful integration into the Afghan polity. If they are, a feasible deal involving the Afghan government, the United States, and the international community could be crafted to allow for the eventual departure of foreign forces after the requirements of counterterrorism and enforcing a peace agreement are satisfied. If not, and the Taliban’s actual aim is to forcibly secure political control in the south and east or undermine or take over the Afghan state writ large, the prospects for a negotiated settlement are dim. Obviously, there is no way to confirm the Taliban’s intentions outside of negotiations, and in this sense, a deliberately targeted process—as an activity alongside strengthening the Afghan state—emerges as a sensible path.
If the U.S. administration chooses to reorient its strategy to prioritize a settlement, five specific actions should be undertaken. First, the U.S. government should revamp its decisionmaking processes to ensure that the totality of U.S. investments in Afghanistan—to include military operations—are oriented toward bringing the Taliban into the negotiating process. This will require the closest political coordination with the Afghan government as well as with the senior U.S. and NATO military commander in Afghanistan—a task that should be the formal responsibility of an empowered U.S. ambassador in Kabul enjoying all the appropriate authorities, resources, and staff necessary for success. Because accomplishing the goal of protecting the Afghan state by ending the conflict will require “high degrees of agility, nuance, and local understanding in a dynamic, complex, and competitive environment,”25 Kabul, rather than Washington, should become the locus for policy implementation, and the ambassador, as the “czar” overseeing all U.S. activity in Afghanistan, must enjoy the autonomy to make the decisions necessary to realize the administration’s objectives without micromanagement by Washington.
Second, Washington should press Kabul to begin a broad intra-Afghan dialogue on the aims and terms of political reconciliation with the Taliban. Although most Afghans seek some sort of settlement to end the current conflict, there are deep divisions among them about the stipulations that would govern reconciliation. Creating a consensus will be critical if a sustainable political settlement is to be achieved. This will require bringing together not only all the various ethnic groups represented in the polity but also key societal constituencies, such as women, ideally in a consultation process that encompasses the provincial, regional, and national levels. Such a conversation will provide an opportunity for ordinary Afghans to define the kind of peace they seek, clarify the kind of compromises they are willing to accept in any negotiation with the Taliban, and develop strategies to ensure that the reconciliation process actually delivers on its promises. Involving the entire range of stakeholders in multiple consultations that would eventually lead up to a loya jirga (grand assembly) that ratifies the consensus is essential to ensure the sustainability of any negotiated peace with the Taliban.
Third, Washington should acknowledge that it is an active participant in the conflict with the Taliban and, as such, prepare to enter into direct talks with the insurgent leadership for the purposes of ending the war and ensuring the success of the broader intra-Afghan dialogue. Engaging in direct parleys with the Taliban allows the United States to minimize the importance of the Quadrilateral Coordination Group’s efforts, which have diminished considerably in importance, while simultaneously driving a deeper wedge between the Quetta Shura and Rawalpindi to exploit their different interests.26 Any direct U.S. conversations with the Taliban, however, will require Washington and Kabul to coordinate much more closely to prevent their own differences, if any, from stymieing any genuine opportunities for progress. Moreover, given that the reconciliation dialogue should remain formally Afghan-owned and Afghan-led, continual negotiations between Kabul and Washington on the aims, terms, and limits of the settlement process will be necessary. Although the United States and Afghanistan are allies in the conflict with the Taliban, it is surprising how uncoordinated the two nations’ strategies have been thus far. If reconciliation is to offer a viable exit from the war, the chasm between Washington and Kabul will have to be bridged with alacrity.
Washington should acknowledge that it is an active participant in the conflict with the Taliban and, as such, prepare to enter into direct talks with the insurgent leadership for the purposes of ending the war and ensuring the success of the broader intra-Afghan dialogue.
Fourth, the United States will have to make difficult decisions about whether to target the Taliban leadership in Pakistan, even while engaged in a political dialogue. There are compelling arguments on both sides of the issue. Thus far, the United States has resisted interdicting the Quetta Shura, except for former Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour, who was seen as implacably opposed to negotiations. Because there is no assurance that direct discussions with the Taliban will bear fruit, Washington should remain willing to target their leadership whenever required, thereby undermining the protection of their sanctuary to either push them to the negotiating table or compel them to stay there. The imperative of targeting the shura may in fact increase in urgency if the Taliban leadership concludes that their current military successes on the battlefield liberate them from the alternative of having to explore any reconciliation that may end up in a compromise with the Afghan state.
Fifth, any effort at seeking a political settlement in Afghanistan will require soliciting regional cooperation for success. All of Afghanistan’s immediate and extended neighbors will be content to support a U.S. effort at pursuing reconciliation with the Taliban so long as their own particular interests are protected. Thus, for example, Iran, Russia, and China would support a negotiated settlement with the Taliban as long as the ensuing agreement contributes toward both defeating the threat posed by the Islamic state and ensuring that the Taliban would not support (or offer succor to) radical Sunni groups intent on destabilizing their own countries. Even India could support reconciliation under such conditions, but because it is unclear how such restraint would be enforced, New Delhi would prefer that Afghan moderates control the process of Taliban reintegration (or, at the very least, that it occur through a constitutional process that most Afghans are comfortable with).
The main challenge to successful reconciliation, other than the Taliban’s preferences itself, will continue to be Pakistan. Rawalpindi would obviously support reconciliation in principle, but it desires an outcome that guarantees to its Taliban clients a share of national power through negotiation in the hope that this result would protect its strategic interests vis-à-vis both Afghanistan and India. Because this result is not at all guaranteed, persuading Pakistan to lean on the Quetta Shura to participate in reconciliation will prove to be an uphill task. While Washington should use more coercion to supplement the inducements long offered toward this end, U.S. leverage on Rawalpindi in actuality is quite limited. The only strategy that stands some chance of success in these circumstances is appealing to Rawalpindi’s self-interest: should the United States fail to secure a political settlement in Afghanistan with Pakistani cooperation, the possible U.S. exit from the country would further exacerbate the conflict in Afghanistan. This, in turn, would only deepen Afghan-Indian cooperation to Pakistan’s even greater disadvantage; further secure the Afghan sanctuary for extremist groups attacking Pakistan; and, by creating stronger incentives for all the regional powers to meddle in Afghan politics in order to protect their own interests, guarantee a much more turbulent western frontier—all with added burdens for Pakistan’s security. Since there is no assurance that Rawalpindi will be moved by even the threat of such outcomes—given that Pakistan can confidently count on China’s assistance for larger geopolitical reasons—Washington can only hope to mitigate Rawalpindi’s obduracy as best it can while it continues to pursue a political settlement in Afghanistan.
All these considerations collectively illuminate how difficult the path to political reconciliation with the Taliban will be. Furthermore, even if the strategy of prioritizing a political settlement is ultimately successful, it is unlikely to produce meaningful results in the near term. The process itself could go on for years and will experience considerable vicissitudes along the way. Significant oscillations are in fact inevitable because of the deep chasms that currently exist on many substantive issues. For example, can the Taliban’s insistence on the exit of all foreign forces be reconciled with the Afghan government’s desire for some long-term U.S. military presence to ensure Afghanistan’s geopolitical independence and to hedge against a resurgence of terrorism and a renewed Taliban insurgency? Can the Taliban’s vision of an Islamic emirate be subordinated to the Afghan polity’s desire to preserve an Islamic republic? Can the Pakistani desire for integrating the Taliban into the Afghan government as insurance for protecting its interests be reconciled with the Afghan determination to avoid strategic subordination to Pakistan at all costs?
The status quo plus approach thus provides a critical backstop to the political settlement process as well as a safety net should the attempts at dialogue fail.
These and many more substantive issues are certain to bedevil any reconciliation initiative. Some issues could be resolved by procedural solutions such as the proper sequencing of political commitments, the incorporation of conditional reciprocity, and even possibly the introduction of third-party mediation at the appropriate juncture. But the very real obstacles to success cannot be overlooked at a time when many states in the region have not only different views about what a successful political settlement should look like but also the capability to impede the outcomes desired by various factions within Afghanistan. For all these reasons, any approach centered on reconciliation cannot be pursued in isolation; a parallel effort to strengthen the Afghan state, especially its military capabilities, and to press Pakistan to change its current strategic behavior, will be essential. The status quo plus approach thus provides a critical backstop to the political settlement process as well as a safety net should the attempts at dialogue fail.

I am amazed at the confusing statements and repetitious and confusing policies bring suggested. The article repeats the same proposals time and again, without once mentioning the most important factor that could save Afghanistan and bring peace...the tribes of Afghanistan. For 16 years the West has been busy building a roof on imaginary walls and as such the roofs keep crumbling down. The foundation of Afghanistan is the Tribes and the walls are its young generation. Both sectors have been disregarded. Without them there will be no peace. The NUG is a selected dysfunctional government. Ghani is destroying the very structure of the nation. Instead of covering multitude of pages with repetitive statements, the West must talk to the people. To the Tribes. Tribal warriors are ready to take the front line based on a partnership with the USA, like they did during the war with the Red Army. Stop wasting American lives and money. Talk to the Tribes. Seek their advise. You will find the solution in www.ncdta.org.

This piece of information is nothing but full of confusing statements, repetitious of same info again and again in different paragraphs and unwise policies of narrow version of any solution. I am not impressed with the author of this article who represented mostly specific interest and instead of broader solution. Like all my fellow readers recommended the solution starts from the tribes which are divided 60 percent Pashtuns and 40 percent other mixed ethnicities. If you make a hierarchy of this Afghans problems and solutions beside local tribes the emphasis revolves around two most important factors Pakistan and Pashtuns. Convince and assure Pakistan that there will be no threat to Pakistan from Afghanistan soil and Pashtuns will get major portion of power in any future govt you have the solution.

Abstract
This report summarizes progress in measuring the optical properties of aerosols and in relating aerosol characteristics to visibility reduction made in the author's laboratory during the period 1965-1971. An instrument, the integrating nephelometer, which measures the scattering component of extinction, b(sp), was developed and used in several field studies. Measured b(sp) and observer visibility have been shown to be highly correlated and to follow the Koschmieder relation. Measured b(sp) is highly correlated (0.95 in Los Angeles) with suspended particle volume in the 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer size range. A useful correlation (0.56 to 0.92 at various sites) has been found between b(sp) and particle mass as collected on a filter. Techniques have been developed to measure b(sp) as a function of relative humidity for ambient and model aerosols. Water, absorbed by hygroscopic aerosols, as H2SO4, and/or deliquescent aerosols, as (NH4)2SO4, make a substantial contribution to visibility reduction. Techniques were also developed to measure the absorption component of extinction, b(sp); to measure the forward/backward scattering ratio; and to determine b(sp) as a function of wavelength.

Fossil Fuel Demand Set To Peak In The 2020s

September 11th, 2018 by Joshua S Hill
The rapid growth of clean technologies is expected to cause fossil fuel demand to peak in the 2020s, according to a new report from Carbon Tracker, serving to put at risk trillions for investors ignorant of or unwilling to participate in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
The new report from independent financial think tank Carbon Tracker contends that demand for coal, gas, and oil is stalling “because of the cost of renewables and battery storage is falling fast, emerging economies are pursuing clean energy, and governmental policy is being driven by the need to slash emissions, control climate change and reduce air pollution.” Specifically, according to the report, “Digitisation allied to technology learning curves in solar PV, wind and batteries are creating disruption in energy, the world’s largest sector.”
As such, Carbon Tracker forecasts that solar and wind will displace all growth in fossil fuel energy technologies — with global energy demand expected to grow at 1 to 1.5% per year while solar and wind will grow at 15% to 20% — causing fossil fuel demand to peak between 2020 and 2027, most likely in 2023.
“The 2020s will be the decade of fossil fuel demand peaks, as one bastion after another is stormed and overwhelmed by the rising renewable tide,” explained Kingsmill Bond, Carbon Tracker New Energy Strategist and author of the report. “This will inevitably lead to trillions of dollars of stranded assets across the corporate sector and hit petro-states that fail to reinvent themselves.”
According to Carbon Tracker, one of the key aspects of this energy transition is the fact that emerging markets will account for the majority of energy demand growth over the coming decades, and they won’t choose the same path that developed nations chose. Renewables provide not only local energy security without the need to import and create long-term environmental concerns, but create innumerable opportunities for job, economic, and technology growth at home.
As such, when viewed through the lens of this large-scale energy transition, the 20th Century can be divvied up into four separate and identifiable phases: 2000-2020 was the innovation phase; 2020-30 will be the peaking phase; 2030-50 will be a phase of rapid change; while 2050 and onward will be the endgame for fossil fuels.
“Fossil fuel demand has been growing for 200 years, but is about to enter structural decline,” said Kingsmill Bond. “Entire sectors will struggle to make this transition. They can expect price declines, greater competition, restructuring, stranded assets and market derating.”
The natural outworking of these predictions, therefore, is the impact it will have on investors unwilling to participate in the transition to a low-carbon energy sector, or those investors and institutions simply unaware of the transition. According to Carbon Tracker, “Much of the fossil fuel industry appears blind to this risk,” with British Petroleum (BP), Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and the International Energy Agency all expecting that fossil fuel demand won’t peak for another generation, or even more.
The impact of this energy transition, therefore, is expected to be “colossal”:
The fossil fuel sector has invested an estimated $25 trillion in infrastructure and there will be systemic risk to financial markets as they seek to digest vast amounts of stranded assets.
The transition will directly affect companies that compose up to a quarter of equity indexes and debt markets, hitting banking, capital goods, transport and automotive sectors.
Fossil fuel exporting countries will suffer. Russia is one of 12 countries where fossil fuel rents account for 10% or more of GDP.
“Investors anticipate, so they will typically react even before companies see peak demand,” said Kingsmill Bond. “This is what happened recently in the coal and European electricity sector transitions. We believe that investors will start to react faster as the energy transition works its way through the world’s capital markets. As each sector is impacted, it becomes easier for the market to anticipate something similar happening to the next sector.”

100% Renewable Energy Across Europe Is More Cost-Effective Than The Current Energy System
Twitter

Facebook
February 8th, 2019 by The Beam
“100% renewables is not a stupid idea, in fact it’s getting more and more mainstream around the world,” exclaimed Hans-Josef Fell, president of Energy Watch Group and father of the German Renewable Energy Sources Act. And how refreshing is it to hear during the United Nations Climate Conference, where we heard way too much noise coming from the fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies.
Hans-Josef Fell presented a new study at COP24. Copyright: Anne-Sophie Garrigou
No pun intended here, but in this climate of scientific denial, it’s time to listen to independent research again! Energy Watch Group and LUT University combined their resources to work on a new research that proves the feasibility of a European energy transition to 100% renewable sources. The study has simulated a full energy transition in Europe across the power, heat, transport, and desalination sectors by 2050 and shows that the transition to 100% renewable energy will be economically competitive with today’s conventional fossil fuel and nuclear energy system. It will also lead greenhouse gas emissions to zero before 2050. So next time someone tells you that 100% renewables are not economically viable, just send him/her/them here.
“This report demonstrates that Europe can switch to a zero-emission energy system. Therefore, European leaders can and should do much more for climate protection than what is currently on the table.” — Hans-Josef Fell
So what does the study show?
Here comes the technical part. First, this transition will require mass electrification across all energy sectors. It is planned that total power generation will exceed four to five times that of 2015, with electricity constituting for more than 85% of primary energy demand in 2050. In this scenario, fossil fuels and nuclear are completely phased out across all sectors.
One of the most important findings of that research is that 100% renewable energy is not more expensive than our current system: The levelized cost of energy for a fully sustainable energy system in Europe remains stable, ranging from 50–60€/MWh through the transition.
Electricity generation in the 100% renewable energy system would consist of 62% solar photovoltaic, 32% wind energy, 4% hydropower, 2% bioenergy, and less than 1% geothermal energy.
“The most important pillar of the climate protection strategy is not to reduce GHG, but to stop them altogether,” reminded Hans-Josef Fell. In fact, according to this groundbreaking study, Europe’s annual greenhouse gas emissions would decline steadily through the transition, from approximately 4200 MtCO2 eq. in 2015 to zero by 2050 across all sectors.
Last but not least “new jobs in renewables will over-compensate the lost jobs in fossil fuel sectors” explained Hans-Josef Fell, as a 100% renewable power system will employ 3 to 3.5 million people. The approximate 800,000 jobs in the European coal industry of 2015 would therefore be zeroed out by 2050, and would be overcompensated by more than 1.5-million new jobs in the renewable energy sector.
“The results of the study showcase that the current goals set forth under the Paris Agreement can and should be accelerated,” said Dr. Christian Breyer, professor for solar economy at Finland’s LUT University, “The transition to 100% clean, renewable energy is very realistic, right now, with the technology we have available today.”
The study concludes with policy recommendations to promote a swift uptake of renewable energy and zero-emissions technology adoption. Among the measures promoted in the report is the support of sector coupling, private investments, tax benefits and legal privileges, with a simultaneous phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. “We should sanction energy companies producing Greenhouse Gases through fossil fuels and nuclear and we need more research, education and training towards a clean energy transition. Education is very important, not only in schools but also for the politicians, for the managers, for the media,” explains Hans-Josef Fell.
“This report demonstrates that Europe can switch to a zero-emission energy system. Therefore, European leaders can and should do much more for climate protection than what is currently on the table” he adds .By implementing strong political frameworks, the report shows that a transition to 100% renewable energy could even be realised earlier than 2050.
Barcelona, Masdar City, Munich, Vancouver, San Franciscso, Copenhagen, Sydney, San Diego, Downtown Doha, these are some of the cities who have already committed to 100% renewable energy targets. “The energy transition is not a question of technology feasibility or economics, it is only a question of political will,” assureed Hans-Josef Fell. There are no technological barriers, no excuses.

Chucking out personal bins
By Melanie Louie
We’ve recently moved into our new office in Hong Kong. We wanted to create a healthy, efficient and future-proof space to reduce waste consumption and reduce carbon emissions.
In a previous post, I’d written about how Cundall is a One Planet Company. As part of the Zero Waste principle, we look to reduce waste, re-use and recycle.
We have donated or reused almost all the furniture and lighting from our previous office which diverted 1770kg of waste from landfill. But to support the reduction in our operational waste production, we have taken the, some would say, drastic measure to remove all personal bins in our open plan office area.
Studies have shown that having personal waste bins reduce recycling rates. This is attributable to the convenience of the nearby bin vs. the effort of going to the recycling bin area. By eliminating the personal bins, we must walk the 40 steps to the appropriate recycling bin when we want to throw out an empty can or scrap of paper.
It may sound like a minor inconvenience, but the rewards we will reap are:
Improved recycling rates, reduced rubbish to landfill and carbon emissions associated with waste disposal
Reduced plastic from reduced bin liners
Less clutter and tripping hazards, improving Health & Safety
A nice stretch for our muscles and break for our eyes from the computer, plus extra steps on our pedometers for the global challenge
According to the World Health Organisation, inactivity is now one of the biggest threats to public health. Directly attributable to 9.4% of all deaths worldwide, or 3.5 million people every year. An office worker typically spends 75% of his or her day sitting, exercise does not undo the damage of prolonged sitting. But taking a movement break every 30 minutes does. Ideally this should be 5 minutes, so why not walk over to your colleague and have that quick catch up as well?
This initiative is not only good for the planet, but for us as well.

Psychiatrist in JonBenét Ramsey case among four people killed in Arizona, police say
***Embargo Phoenix*** Scottsdale police Sgt. Ben Hoster says evidence at the scenes leads police to believe the killings are related.
(CNN) — The killings of three people this week in Arizona are thought to be related and authorities are investigating the death of a fourth person to see whether it is connected, Scottsdale Sgt. Ben Hoster said Saturday.
The victims include famed forensic psychiatrist Steven Pitt, who was involved in several high-profile cases, including the investigation into the death of JonBenét Ramsey in 1996. He was found shot dead in north Scottsdale.
The other victims were 48-year-old Veleria Sharp and 49-year-old Laura Anderson, two paralegals at a Scottsdale law firm who were killed Friday afternoon.
They were shot, police said in a news release.
“We are in the middle of our investigations so I’m not going to talk about who’s being investigated or what’s happening,” Hoster told reporters Saturday. “We’re asking for help from the public.”
A fourth homicide victim was found Saturday. Police said a man was found dead at a mental health counselors’ office in Scottsdale. Hoster said that police are trying to see whether the shooting is related to the others.
Police issued a sketch of the suspect but have not identified him. Police say they do not believe there is more than one shooter.
Evidence from Thursday’s and Friday’s scenes appears to connect the shootings, Hoster said.
The sergeant said he didn’t have information that would indicate a serial killer is behind the shootings.

“Some Progress” Reported Before IATSE Film & TV Contract Talks Stalled

IATSE officials are reporting that “some progress was made” last week before negotiations for a new film and TV contract broke off, and that the union “remains committed to returning to the negotiating table in pursuit of a fair deal for the membership.” Talks with management’s AMPTP are scheduled to resume during the week of July 23 – just days before the July 31 expiration of the current contract, which covers some 43,000 members of 13 West Coast IATSE locals.

AMPTP Rejects WGA Request For "Group Boycott" Of Talent Agents Who Won't Sign Proposed Code Of Conduct
The main area of dispute is the union’s demand that shows created for streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu start paying residuals into its pension and health plans. “Streaming content must pay its fair share towards pension and healthcare for the industry,” leaders of IATSE Cinematographers Guild Local 600 said today in a communique to members. “As our industry evolves, we must be in a position to participate in its growth and evolution.”
A major source of income for the IATSE benefit plans comes from residuals. But unlike the talent guilds, whose members receive residuals directly when their work is shown in reruns or in supplemental markets, residuals are paid indirectly to below-the-line crews via contributions to their pension and health plans. But unlike films and broadcast and cable TV shows, streaming shows don’t pay any residuals into the IATSE plans.
In 2012, IATSE projected that residuals from DVD and Blu-ray sales, pay TV and other sources would generate nearly $1 billion in residuals through 2015. Since then, however, the DVD and Blu-ray sector has crashed, largely supplanted by streaming services.
The union says one of its top priorities is “funding our health and pension plans through a sustainable mechanism that aligns our funding structure with our evolving industry.” The pension plan, with $3.8 billion in assets and more than $5.6 billion in liabilities, was only 67.4% funded as of January 1, 2017, and is fast approaching “critical status,” which is reached when a plan falls below 65% funded. Over the past three years, its funding level has declined precipitously – falling from 80.8% in 2015 to 76.8% in 2016.
“The increase in content created for streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others has created a tremendous increase in work opportunities for our members,” Local 600 leaders told their members. “As this content increases proportionate to traditional media, the pressure on the pension and health plan grows. Pension cuts are NOT an acceptable solution to this problem.”
Union leaders noted that the Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plan “is funded by several elements, including participant premiums, employer contributions, investment income and payments linked to distribution (residuals). Currently, residuals are generated from traditionally-produced theatrical features and television. As the production of streaming content continues to grow, our residual structure must reflect this expanding market. For the health of our benefits plans, our funding streams must adapt to and align with current methods of production.”
Addressing the industry’s brutally long work hours is another goal of the union in these negotiations. “The safety and well-being of the membership is a top priority in these negotiations and we will continue to insist that our employers recognize this and begin to seriously address the issues of safety and fatigue,” Local 600 leaders told their members.
To address that problem – which is seen as a safety issue as well as a “quality of life” issue – the union says it’s proposed “reasonable turnaround that provides adequate rest for workers” and “sensible guaranteed options of housing or transportation for those too tired to drive.” IATSE is also seeking wage and benefit contribution increases and “more equitable wages and terms and conditions for streaming content below the threshold for high-budget SVOD.”

Entangled States
More Entanglement
February 11, 2010
by Nicholas Knisely	
Religion / Science	
All the neat things about Entanglement are “neat” primarily because they are fundamentally counter-intuitive. They are counter-intuitive because entanglement has been only seen in very low temperature and limited settings. Now there’s a theoretical proposal that claims this limit isn’t as strong a limit as we thought.
The paper that makes the proposal is written up on the Arxiv blog. I’m quoting the beginning of the article because it’s such a great introduction to the idea of Entanglement (and it’s pretty obvious from the description’s first paragraph why I find the phenomenon so evocative when viewed theologically):
“Entanglement is the weird quantum process in which two objects share the same existence. So a measurement on one object immediately influences the other, not matter how far apart they may be.
Entanglement is a strange and fragile thing. Sneeze and it vanishes. The problem is that entanglement is destroyed by any interaction with the environment and these interactions are hard to prevent. So physicists have only ever been able to study and exploit entanglement in systems that do not interact easily with the environment, such as photons, or at temperatures close to absolute zero where the environment becomes more benign.
In fact, physicists believe that there is a fundamental limit to the thermal energies at which entanglement can be usefully exploited. And this limit is tiny, comparable to very lowest temperatures.
Today, Fernando Galve at the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain and a few buddies, show how this limit can be dramatically increased. The key behind their idea is the notion of a squeezed state.”

Robbers Ran From Store Clerk Who Got Bigger Sword
Posted on August 20, 2015 by Vinh Nguyen	
Two thieves walked into the store demanded money, and they used knives to rob the store. Unfortunately for them, the store clerk got a bigger knife, and it looks like the one in Prince of Persia video game, with curve and all that. The chase was on, and the thieves ran hard. Check it out in the YouTube video right after the break. Enjoy!!!

RINOs “Dirty Deal” With No Border Wall Funds CONFIRMED

This might cause your head to explode….
Grassfire has just CONFIRMED that RINOs on Capitol Hill are working hand-in-hand with Democrats on a secret, backroom, dirty deal that RUBBER STAMPS THE OBAMA AGENDA and does not provide one dime for the Border Wall.
According to Bloomberg:
“Republican leaders offered a new government spending plan behind closed doors Tuesday that doesn’t include money for a border wall, said a Senate Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.”
Notice… “Republican leaders” are working “behind closed doors with…. “Democrats”! This is precisely what we have been alerting our team members about for weeks. We sniffed this out earlier this month. And let’s be clear: this Dirty Deal has Paul Ryan’s fingerprints all over it!
+ + Chuck Schumer gloats about the “Dirty Deal”…
And listen to what Chuck Schumer is saying about this backroom, dirty deal…
“The fact that the wall is now off the table, Americans can breathe a sigh of relief.” — Chuck Schumer
A “sigh of relief”? Tell that to the families who have lost loved ones to criminal illegal aliens. Tell that to Americans who have lost jobs to the flood of illegals. Tell that to the taxpayers who have paid BILLIONS in welfare and other benefits to people here illegally. Tell that to the families who have been destroyed by the illegal drug trade flooding across our southern border!
And let’s look again at how much funding President Trump was actually asking for: $1.4 billion of which $999 million was for starting the building of a border wall. CNSNews puts the $1.4 billion in perspective, noting it equals just .035% of total federal spending in 2017 — or the amount the Department of Health And Human Services spends every 11 hours!
+ + This fight is NOT over!
Despite the RINO dirty deal that was being negotiated behind closed doors yesterday, this fight is not over. Congress must vote by FRIDAY on another emergency spending bill — but Republican leaders have not yet even released the text of the bill!
Today, Grassfire is hand-delivering more than 12,000 “Fund The Wall” letters to congressional offices. We want to FLOOD Congress with petitions but I need your help.
We must add nearly 13,000 petition signers in the next 24 hours to reach our goal for an emergency FUND THE WALL petition delivery!
I’m asking you to do two things today…
Go here to sign the FUND THE WALL petition and have your petition included in this week’s delivery to Congress. Click here to automatically sign:
We currently have <#cause_total#> petitions on file. Please note that we must reach our 40,000 petition to trigger our delivery and maximize your impact!
Second action item…
Please alert your friends!
Go here for Facebook and other share tools.
Thank you for taking action!

We have a Republican President, Congress and Senate and we are allowing the Democrats to continue calling the shots ! We can’t even get 1B$ in the budget to start building the wall for fear or yet another government shutdown. We have no wall started, no repeal of ObamaCare, a message to DREAMERS they do not have to worry about being deported, We still have 127 Judge positions to fill. But, our side did do one major thing and that was getting a Conservative in the Supreme court. The Democrats plus the RINOs are doing everything possible to ensure a Trump failure. The Fascist/Communists doing this believe if none of this is done the GOP will be finished, they will win the next election and pick up right where they left off. It’s much to soon to even guess what Trump will do in the coming years but we do know WE are in power if we can force our spineless elected officials to use it !

MEXICO LINDO, A BRIEF HISTORY
MEXICO LINDO, A BRIEF HISTORY

Three men, standing at the Mexican border, looking south:
Man #1: Mexico Lindo.
Man #2: I don’t see nothin’ so ‘lindo’ about it.
Man #3: Just looks like more of Texas to me.
Man #1: You have no eyes!
(Iconic lines from a film, anyone want to guess which one?)
It’s an interesting history, for by the time the first settlers dropped anchor at Jamestown in 1607, all of South America, Central America, Mexico and what is now the southeast United States, as far north as South Carolina, had come under the dominion of Spain and Portugal. Mexico was first, when Hernan Cortes subdued the Aztec king in 1519. Columbia, Venezuela, Peru, all the way down to Argentina soon followed. Brasil was captured by Portuguese which only made a difference in the tongue that would be the national language and the customs that would be adopted in their civil administration.
All of South America was Spanish for all intents and purposes.
And all of this territory was under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Catholic Church.
This is significant for a pecking order had emerged in the early Church that next to Rome, where Peter was crucified, the English, Spanish and French churches were ranked in order of firsts; England, interesting enough because the first above-ground church was built there in the 1st Century, by none other than Joseph of Arimathea, so legend says. France came next because it was where Mary Magadalene purportedly built her church, near Marseilles. And third, Spain, where St James is said to have been buried, although he is also purported to be buried (at least his head) in the Armenian Church in Jerusalem after being beheaded by Herod Agrippa. (I know its confusing, and that is exactly what makes the 1st Century so interesting…you can’t come up with conclusive evidence about anything, yet you still know many definitive, historical things had to have happened.)
So none of these stories can be confirmed by eyewitness accounts, but no matter, at the time of the infusion of English Protestants onto our part of North America there was a French colonial empire, under the auspices of the French Church to its north (Canada) and the Spanish Church to its south, from the Rio Grande to the tip of the continent.
Both empires were headed by hereditary kings who on their face were extremely pious, with a Church prelate at their left hand steering virtually every decision, such as the 1588 assault by the Armada of Phillip II, against Elizabeth II, for the specific purpose of restoring the Church and driving out the Protestant heretics, …some of whom, 20 years later, would begin to settle on what are now American shores[…]

Earlier this month, Supreme linked up with skate brand Spitfire on a collaborative capsule filled with bright-colored separates and skate accessories. Now, the cult New York City imprint unveils its lineup of Summer 2018 T-shirts. The collection features seven different tees in an array of colors.
Standing out amongst the pack is the black T-shirt which includes “SUPREME” emblazoned across the front in pastel tones and the following cities underneath: “New York,” “London” and “Paris.” An additional standout is the magenta tee, arriving with a large blue and white Mona Lisa graphic. There is another violet iteration, with yellow and blue logos throughout the design – turned to its side.
A portion of the summer tee sales will benefit organizations working to protect children and aid families impacted by the Trump Administration’s immigration policies. Additionally, donations will be made via Act Blue and will also benefit organizations like the ACLU.
The Supreme tees will be available for purchase online and in-store at the New York, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, London and Paris locations on June 28. Supreme Japan will see a release on June 30.

When I Became a Sexual Compulsive
Stephen Bradford Long November 3, 2016 FeaturedGet Real
In 2013, I was sick with heartbreak. My boyfriend, on a sunny January day in Baltimore, broke up with me.
He was a conservative Christian, and so was I. We both believed that homosexuality was not God’s best for humanity, and that it would be a sin to act on it. And yet, here we were: deeply in love, and now deeply heartbroken. We had lived in a horrible in-between place, unable to change our beliefs and unable to stop loving each other. The dissonance drove us mad, and it ended in him breaking up with me. I’d never known such rending emotional pain.
In the months following the break up, I fled to sex. I’d never had sex with a man before my ex-boyfriend. The horrible coldness of our undead relationship – a relationship that was deeply intimate and yet deeply tortured about that intimacy – was so deep and so penetrating to me that I needed some kind of human, bodily warmth. And I needed to get away from the icy coldness of Orthodox Christianity, which had condemned me for all my life to a box of untouchableness. While others were able to touch, kiss, have sex, get married, I was condemned to the sidelines. What was sinful for me was not sinful for the rest of humanity. That isolation from my sexual self, crystalized by grief, was driving me to madness, and I needed the warmth and reality and physicality of sex.
At first, the sex helped. It felt like a warm blanket and a fireplace on a cold winter day, thawing me out, bringing feeling back to my humanity, bringing me out of my numbness. Sex can be healing, and it was like a balm to my soul. The guys I slept with were kind, considerate, fun, smart.
I don’t know when it all started to slide – when it turned from medicinal to compulsive. Somewhere along the way, I got lost. I lost sight of the path I was walking. Perhaps I’d been lost the whole time, just following a rabbit trail until finally I had no way home.
I became deeply compulsive. I lost nearly all of 2014 to hooking up and looking for sex. School was delayed for another year. I spent hours and hours on Grindr, obsessively cruising. I would hook up with one man during the evening and then hookup with another man the next morning. I was losing control, sliding away, but I didn’t care: my grief was so intense.
I was, at that point, no longer grieving for my ex but now grieving for my faith – a faith that I loved and yet felt barred from. I was raised deep within the warm belly of American Christianity. The Christian faith was my home; it was where I ran to when I needed comfort; it was my family, my rest, my guidance. All of that felt destroyed, now. I still believed in Christianity, but I was barred from it or, somehow even worse, destroying it: denominations and centuries old institutions were splitting and bleeding because of people just like me. If anything made me feel untouchable, it was that. More than how exclusive the church was, I hated how much the LGBT issue was tearing it limb from limb.
Accompanying my grief was an icy and devastating depression – it laid hold of me and deepened, deepened, deepened. I would wake up in the morning and go to bed at night wanting nothing more than a silent, hidden room where I could hide and never be seen or touched again. I started dreaming about this room, and the merciful stillness and emptiness it brought me. I would go up into the mountains to hide in my depression, get away from the clamor of all the world that I felt hated me.
Warning signs …
The universe started to give me warning signs that I was spiraling too hard and fast. I drove to my first-ever threesome, and a man in his underwear answered the door. I followed him to the top of the house, where another man was sitting on the bed. They were tying bands of rubber around their biceps, with hypodermic needles lying next to him on the bed. “Would you like to get high with us?” The man asked.
Standing there, on the threshold of something terrifying and mind-dissolvingly pleasurable, I almost said yes. Instead, I stammered out, “I don’t do that,” and I fled. But I was deeply shaken. If I were more exhausted, more horny, more desperate – even just a little bit – I would have said yes. I knew that I was close to plunging into depths I’d never seen before, that my despair was pushing me to extreme self destruction. I felt absolutely helpless to do anything about it. It became clear to me: I was sexually compulsive to the point of not knowing how to change myself. I had always loved sex and wanted more of it – that much is normal – but this went beyond love of sex. this was a carnivorous need that was eating me alive, consuming every thought and moment and ounce of energy.
Redemption came to me by way of Scruff. A gay pastor had set up a profile on Scruff which read: “not looking for sex, I am happily married to a man. I am a pastor, and if you need someone to talk to, just message me.”
I started to message him, late at night after hooking up. Pastor Tom was my one source of consolation, there in the blackness of compulsive sex. Eventually, we met in person, and then I started attending his church. He helped me get back on my feet; helped me get into a 12-step program for relationships, and helped me get into therapy and onto mood stabilizing meds. I finally stopped hooking up completely in November of 2014. Two weeks later, I met my boyfriend: an incredible, safe, sensitive, beautiful, smart and gentle man. He was safe to break with, be sexual with, and have a total meltdown with. With my partner, I started to heal.
Now, I am discovering wholeness. That wholeness is due, in large part, to the willingness to accept that sexuality is human. With some important exceptions, people are sexual, and people have sex. I am a person, and I have sex. That does not make me weak, or shallow. Sex is complicated. Trying to tame it and simplify it and put it into boxes of absolute rights and wrongs only hurts people, as it hurt me. I am dedicated to monogamy, I still believe in a sexual ethic, but I also embrace gray spaces – is it wrong to have sex before marriage? Is it wrong to explore? My only answer is that we are human, and that right and wrong may not be as relevant as we think it is. What matters most, perhaps, is wholeness and integrity.
I reached the point where I could no longer afford to entertain the Church’s morality: my life was on the line. Many people – too many people – are in a similar situation. The Church must struggle with this reality, and find an adequate response; that response starts with listening. Now, as I live in a new sphere of faith and relationship, I am only thankful that whatever shambles of a Christian faith I have is still intact. Many are not so lucky.

Great article about a struggle that I know all too well. God bless you for sharing. 🙂

I still can’t believe someone would take advice from a pastor on Scruff. Isn’t that some kind of sex site? I imagine ones credibility would go flying out the door.
November 7, 2016 Stephen Schmidt Reply
I imagine that’s how a lot of religious people felt about Jesus’ hanging out with hookers and the like …
November 7, 2016 Jim S
Could be I guess. But seems quite a stretch. As long as he isn’t doing anything to entice anyone to sin further. Very interesting to say the least.

HIPAA Violation? Sue Me
Posted By Chris Dimick on Mar 1, 2011
This is a true story that occurred recently in Indiana. Failing to collect payment for treatment, a medical group sent a patient to collections. In providing the unpaid bills to the collections attorney, practice staff failed to redact sensitive information. When the attorney filed the bills with the court as part of his collection action, the patient’s positive HIV status became public record.
The patient sued the practice and won. The jury awarded $1.25 million in damages.
As a case of wrongful disclosure this one seems pretty open-and-shut. But how exactly did the patient and his attorney proceed? Under which of the following did the patient bring action:
HIPAA privacy rule
HIPAA security rule
HITECH breach notification rule
Indiana Medical Malpractice Act
.
The patient sued the practice and won under the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act.
Why not HIPAA? Because he could not.
The case is a good reminder that although HIPAA sets a standard for an individual’s privacy rights it does not provide a private right of action, says Nicholas K. Lagina, an attorney with Krieg DeVault, based in Indiana.
When it comes to HIPAA violations, the patient is limited to filing complaints with appropriate governmental agencies, such as the Office for Civil Rights, he says. Other sources of law must form the basis of a lawsuit.
Common Law and the Theory of Negligence
Individuals facing what they believe to be a wrongful use or disclosure often fall back on traditional common law tort principles, according to Lagina.
“Typically claims are brought under some sort of claim of negligence, violation of privacy rights, or invasion of privacy,” he says. “You also see providers face allegations of negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, or even allegations of things such as defamation.”
Negligence is a tort concept available in every state, and it is broad enough to cover many types of actions.
In essence, negligence is the concept that someone had a duty to someone else, the duty was breached, and the breach resulted in an injury. “If you can show all those elements,” Lagina says, “you can fit all kinds of causes of actions underneath the theory of negligence.”
In some states, consumer protection laws and data breach laws also can provide a cause of action for privacy complaints such as wrongful disclosure.
Will Insurers Push Back?
The Indiana case is interesting for another reason, Lagina says. Cases like this may change professional liability insurance.
At the time of the interview, Lagina had not seen all of the case documents, but it appeared that the medical group’s insurance company would pay $250,000 of the $1.25 million award. This is the medical malpractice cap in Indiana for a case like this.
The remaining $1 million presumably would be paid by the Indiana Patient’s Compensation Fund.
“One of the things that will be interesting in the Indiana case as it progresses will be to see if the Indiana Patient’s Compensation Fund, which is the ultimate payer of excess damages, will try to argue that this is not malpractice,” Lagina says.
Lagina has no knowledge that it will, but generally he expects that if malpractice laws increasingly serve as the platform for rising privacy complaints, liability insurers will respond.
“I believe you’ll see in the future an interplay in the way courts are interpreting these kinds of allegations and what the insurance companies are doing in respect to insuring for those allegations,” he says.
“To the extent an insurer believes an act or a judgment is not covered under their policy, that is going to have some practical and pronounced effects on healthcare providers.”
Changes could come for individuals seeking damages, also. States considering malpractice reform have enacted or are considering multiple options: limiting damages, adding procedural requirements intended to discourage “frivolous” lawsuits, and shortening statutes of limitation.
A Share in the Damages
The HITECH modifications to HIPAA made no impact on an individual’s right of action. However, they do affect individuals in tangential ways.
HITECH grants state attorneys general the ability to bring civil action and seek damages on behalf of their residents for HIPAA violations.
A second provision provides individuals harmed by a wrongful disclosure under HIPAA a percentage of any recovery or settlement. The provision will be effective for any violation occurring after February 2009, but the Department of Health and Human Services has until 2012 to issue the regulation.
Once the regulation is in effect, Lagina foresees a spike in reported violations. The rule “has the potential to increase complaints, because individuals will have an actual monetary stake in the recovery,” he notes.
Editor’s note: An abbreviated version of this article appears in the March print issue.

Interesting article and it shows the lack of interest and/or training of those involved in managing and protecting patient information. Unfortunately, this probably happens more than one thinks. I am glad to see more articles regarding this. The redacting could have saved time, money, reputations, and possible jobs.
Thanks

I am involved in a workers compensation case in Florida. The judge in the case has issued a final order, in the order he explains in detail why he denied most of my case and goes into detail on my medical treatment and specific injuries, treating physicians etc etc.
Additionally he slanders me by referring to me as a “Slick Litigant” he further states I am working the system and my answers were calculated. Which could not be further from the truth. Interestingly enough, I discovered that the Judges office disseminated all of this on there public web site.
I requested in an email it be redacted and was told no, that because it’s a judges order it cannot be redacted, I also contacted HIPPA themselves and received a vague response (email) that HIPPA does not cover workers compensation period, with no further details provided. At this point I responded and requested further details, to date I have not received them.
It is somewhat confusing that the judges office and HIPPA were posed basically the same questions and I received somewhat different responses. If it’s true that HIPPA at the federal level cannot cover a workers compensation case at the state level then perhaps this law/rule or at this point whatever seems to govern this bizarre reponse needs to be challenged in federal court.

I had a similar incident (sent me to collections- got the paperwork with my meds listed on it) My doctor indicated the type of medication he prescribed and the dosage. This would be an example of a violation correct? Suggestions on next steps?

I am a registered nurse who went into a medical detox facility. I was very concerned about my privacy but was assured by the intake nurse that EVERYTHING was private!! It was a hospital inpatient facility. She advised me that they were on a separate system compared to the rest of the hospital and those records..reason for the visit was blocked by everyone unless u worked on that unit..Approx a month later I went to see my cardiologist and he stated he pulled up my hospital record and there it was a description of why I was inpatient at the hospital “opioid detox”. I was completely humiliated and felt my hippa rights were violated. since I work in the medical field this will severely affect everything that I have spent my life building. I wouldn’t have gone there if this would have been attached to my regular medical record. what recourse do I have? This is such a violation!!! I went to great length to protect my situation. pls help. I will face serious repercussions over this.

In January 2012 I had STD tests done at the local hospital. The clerk who checked me in told my husband what tests I had done. He confronted me to ask the reason for the tests. This woman was previously his fiance, and he has now moved out and moved in with her. Do I have any recourse? I contacted the hospital administration anonymously (without the details that would give away who the clerk was), and they urged me to file a complaint, and I have not.

I am a lawyer who represents persons whose HIPPA rights have been violated. Several people who have left comments here have a cause of action for a violation of their privacy. A doctor I know had surgery on his knee and another doctor felt he should not be seeing patients in the hospital while he was taking pain killers. He sought out the other doctors records and used them in an open meeting to try and have action taken against the other doctor. I find that the worst violators of HIPPA are medical professional’s who cannot resist the temptation to look up other medical health professionals. The show the least respect for each other it seems. I saw a similar case where a health professional looked up the aids history of a co worker who was being seen by another doctor for his condition. No reason, just curious when he saw him go to see the doctor who treats aids patients.

I actually have a question.i witnessed today and elderly woman who was brought in by ambulance have her clothes taken off right out in the open of the ER 10 feet away from me.they only held up a sheet.then they put a gown on her.am I wrong to believe they should have done this in a more private way such as an examination room or behind some kid of curtain.i felt so bad she was not even aware of this.if it was me and I found out they did this in this manor I would be greatly upset.

I was wondering what/who you would sue if I had a hippa violation of: A person at a facility that I was going to could not get a hold of me or my wife, so that person decided to call my place of work, she talked to the secretary and told her that I was going to kill myself and she was trying to find where I was at. The secretary then transferred the call to my Director and she told her the same thing (that I was going to kill myself). My director called my wife and asked if everything was okay because she got that call that I was going to kill myself. That made me take extra time off of work because of emotional distress and there were hippa investigaters that were pursuing the problem. My Dr. told me (where the hippa violator works) that if I wanted to sue, that I would most definatly win)
There are a lot of other things that go along with this, but isn’t it wrong to call anybody besides my emergency contact, especially not calling my place of work (a hospital)
Thank you

I went to treatment for alcohol abuse and I have been sober for nearly a year now. My husband and I just went through a divorce and he found my treatment assignments and step work in a binder I had hidden under my bed and presented them in court these same documents were part of my treatment plan and chart and even had the treatment facilities name on the top of some papers. Later these documents were mailed out anonymously to people on my witness list. These documents were used in court and only lawyers should have had copies to keep for safe keeping in their offices during this time. I have also been using a soberlink device that is HIPPA protected to prove my sobriety, these documents were printed out and a publicized to others, Is there any form of legal action I can take? The people I suspect both work at the hospital where I live and definitely know Hippa rules and regulations. Please Help!

I was dismissed from the hospital after an overnight observation, two weeks after knee replacement surgery. The dismissal paper told me to a)come to physical therapy as usual two days later b)RECOMMENDED I not drive.
A month later I received a letter from the Department of Transportation telling me to surrender my license indefinitely, because of an ‘unsatisfactory medical report’.
I went to the driver’s license station & got a copy of the letter they’d received from the attending physician. It reported that I had a ‘CHRONIC’ leg condition’, my name and SS number. I’d also mentioned in the hospital that I had a headache from squinting at the TV, because I’d forgot my reading glasses, so I also had ‘chronic eye problems.’
My physical therapist told me the stress had set back my therapy by at least 1 1/2 weeks at that time. I cannot attend my followup appointments with my surgeon, and cannot continue my rehabilitation due to loss of transportation. I was supposed to continue therapy on my own using the equipment at their facility for another month. If I drive anyway I am subject to prosecution for driving under suspension.
I am extreme low-income & cannot get an answer from an attorney. Can you advise me?

I have an open CPS case and during a family team meeting the guardian ad litem disclosed in front of the whole meeting that I was sexually abused as a kid. I don’t know if this is a hipaa violation or what it would be called? But I felt revictimized , and very upset that he said this in front of the child’s aunt who is definitely going to spread this around the small town I live in. Can I sue this guy?

My brother went to a local Walgreens pharmacy and asked for a print out of his prescriptions. Along with his list they also included mine my nephews my cousins and a sister inlaws list of prescriptions. I realize you cannot sue under current hipaa laws is there anything else to provide a cause of action, I live in Wisconsin.

I’m victim to the same kind of case. I have been battling with this case for one year now. My HIV status was made public by a hospital receptionist. She intentionally accessed my records in an effort to hurt me. She did not like the fact of me dating her son, who was HIV negative. I am always upfront with people I date, and he knew. She in return thought the world should know. This is just a jist of the situation. I went into a deep depression. My world came crashing down around me. I started to loose everything I worked so hard for one by one. I was a truck driver, making $800 a week. I moved me and my boyfriend into this beautiful 3 story townhouse. Everything was wonderful, and most of all I was extremely happy and proud. I eventually started on depression and anxiety medication. This effected my job. I could no longer drive while in this state of mind. I couldn’t take the meds while driving because they made me dizzy and tired. I lost my job! My boyfriend was getting brained washed by his mom and felt sorry for her because she had lost her job because of what she did to me. Then he left! That was my second income! After he left I got more and more behind on bills and rent. I eventually got evicted from our home and was forced to move in with my mom. Since then I have not been myself. I’m sad most days and life has begun to feel pointless. I worked so hard to get my CDLs (Commercial Driver license) to have it taking from me quicker that I got it. Currently my life is on hold, and have no desire to get out of bed and do anything with my life. My life was taking abruptly from me. I know this can’t be the end but my lawyer is expected this to carry on for at least another two years. So now I sit here in my bed, wondering what I do next.

People! This is just the comments section after a magazine article! No one here can answer your questions! Please try your state or local legal aid office or on-line forum (if they have one.) Maybe try googling actionable HIPAA violations. Some of the above commenters may have a case , but, unfortunately, sometimes nasty gossip is just a fact of life. You can’t always make money on spiteful, mean people or even incompetent ones. It’s sad , but true. Unless you are Donald Trump, you can’t bring lawsuits against anyone you want
to, no matter how much they may deserve it. To all those whose life was badly disrupted, what did folks do before HIPAA was established? Please…
take a deep breath and try to forgive and forget. It may be your only option. I wish you all the good karma you surely deserve! God Bless, and try to get some rest.
SANDERS…please try and get a second opinion from both a doctor and a lawyer. You may need other meds or none. If none, you can drive, If the lawyer says it will take another two years..you will need the money, cause he won’t wait on it. Your solutions seem to be sucking even more life from you. Good luck and hang in there!

@Deb October 30, 2015-“try to forgive and forget.” I don’t think so! Peoples medical privacy has been breached. Those very inept actions and release of medical information cause humiliation, embarrassment, a potential lose of a job or not getting hired for a job, plus mental anguish, to name just a few.
They have every right to seek legal recourse for the damages they have endured at the hands of the people they trusted with their medical information.

My question is this, my ex husband’s wife made my daughter her first gyno appt because she wanted to know if my daughter is having sex. When my daughter went to the appt my daughter filled out the paperwork and did not put her step mother on any of the paperwork. The step mother called the dr office requesting to know the outcome of the appt. They would not give her any information because she was not listed on the papers. She threw a huge fit and even told them she was her mother and has all right to know. Now the step mother works for an insurance company and knows all about the hipaa rules. I found out when I took my daughter in for a follow up appt that she was listed as my daughter’s mother. I corrected that right away. Do I have grounds to file hipaa violation against her for intruding on my daughter’s medical files?
By the way my daughter’s is almost 18 and my ex and I have 50/50 custody. She does not have an custodial rights to my daughter.

Appomattox Courthouse; The Beginning of the End
Posted on April 9, 2017 Categories History, Uncategorized	
Today in History, April 9: 1865 – One of the most momentous events in American history. After years of foiling every move the Union made, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had finally been run to ground. Countless Yankee Generals had been bested by him, but he had finally met his match…not tactically, but in determination, by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. At Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, Lee, his army starving and with nowhere else to run, in spite of the fact that he would “rather die a thousand deaths”, agreed to surrender the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant. Lee arrived in his best uniform; Grant, typically, arrived in a muddy private’s uniform. Grant offered terms that included Confederate officers keeping their horses and sidearms, enlisted men keeping their horses so that they could farm their land, as long as they agreed to abide by their paroles and obey the laws of the land. Lee was very appreciative of these terms, saying they would be helpful to his army, men he loved. As Lee mounted his horse and left the site of the surrender, Union soldiers began to cheer. Grant quickly silenced them, reminding them that the Confederates were once again their countrymen. The surrender document was signed in the home of Wilmer McLean. Ironically, in the first battle of the war, First Bull Run, or First Manassas if you are from the South, Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard’s headquarters were in McLean’s home in Manassas, where cannon shot destroyed part of the house. McLean moved south to Appomattox Courthouse to keep his family safe. So, as is said, the Civil War began in Wilmer McLean’s front yard, and ended in his parlor.
Lee was given the opportunity by Grant to allow one of his subordinates to accept the surrender…to avoid humiliation. Lee refused…his FATHER, Light Horse Harry Lee, had been with Washington at Yorktown and witnessed the ungentlemanly act of British Gen. Lord Cornwallis sending a subordinate to surrender his sword to Washington. Lee refused to dishonor his family name by repeating the act. Grant did not require Lee to surrender his sword, but Lee was the man that represented his army at Appomattox Courthouse. Both gentlemen, North and South, maintained their honor.
Other notables at the meeting were Captain Robert Todd Lincoln, the President’s son. Robert had insisted on serving despite his father’s reservations, so Grant found a place for him on his staff. Major Gen. Phillip Sheridan, who had been a very successful commander and who would one day command all of the US Army. Also Grant’s adjutant, Ely S. Parker, a Seneca Indian who was chosen to write out the surrender because he had the best hand writing of those present.
Poor McLean’s woes were not over, either. Officers present made off with almost everything except the wallpaper in the room to remember the occasion.

The Demented Politics of the New Zealand Terrorist
James Peron

Mar 15
Note: We are using the words of the terrorist in New Zealand to describe his fascistic agenda. This is by no means an endorsement, quite the contrary; we find his position the antithesis of what this page is all about.
The terrorist attack by white supremacists in New Zealand is horrific. We are still awaiting details but the estimated death toll is now 49 with dozens injured.
What we know is that a group of individuals attacked two mosques in Christchurch. The instigator of the attack posted online he was about to attack “the invaders.” He said:
Well lads, it’s time to stop shitposting and time to make a real life effort post.
I will carry out and attack against the invaders, and will even live stream the attack via facebook.
The facebook link is below, by the time you read this I should be going live.
(Link deleted)
It’s been a long ride and despite all your rampant faggotry, slur, fecklessness and degeneracy, you are all top blokes and the best bunch of cobbers a man could ask for.
In the attack on the Linwood mosque, where ten were killed, the terrorists were surprised when an individual in the mosque returned fire on them. The armed congregant chased the attackers away, but apparently they had already killed 10 people. The New Zealand Herald reported:
A second shooting happened at a mosque in the Linwood area of the city.
One Friday prayer goer returned fire with a rifle or shotgun.
Witnesses said they heard multiple gunshots around 1.45pm.
A well known Muslim local chased the shooters and fired two shots at them as they sped off.
He was heard telling police officers he was firing in “self defence”.
At the second mosque there were no armed congregants and the shooting lasted longer and resulted in about three times the death rate.
Update: More details on the Linwood attack have come to light since this was written. The congregant managed to wrestle a gun away from the attacker and gave chase to him. This information was NOT available at the time this was written. The New Zealand Herald’s new report on this is here.
The manifesto left by the terrorist — whose name I don’t think deserves mentioning — is a mishmash of ideas. He calls himself an “Eco-fascist,” one who combines environmentalism, racism and authoritarianism into one repulsive package. In his mind the world is dying from over-population, but over-population of the “wrong” kind. He hates capitalism, free markets, and free trade but he loves the Communist Chinese government and fascism. He takes the racist rhetoric of Donald Trump and mixes it with Marxist rhetoric about the poor workers of the world.
In his fevered imagination alleged “over population” is directly tied to “mass immigration” and “sub-replacement fertility” among whites. The culprits who deserve the blame, he says, are the “corporate entities” who “invited” immigrants to “replace the White people.” It’s Paul Ehrlich meets Adolph Hitler, Bernie Sanders in cahoots with Benito Mussolini.
He says global warming and immigration:
…Are the same issue, the environment is being destroyed by over population, we Europeans are one of the groups that are not over populating the world. The invaders are the ones over populating the world. Kill the invaders, kill the overpopulation and by doing so save the environment.
He calls for a form of “Green Nationalism” which will save the planet by stopping “the continued destruction of the natural environment itself through mass immigration and uncontrolled urbanization, whilst offering no true solution to either issue.”
Hate Crimes and Terrorism
He readily admits to being a terrorist and openly stated an often-unacknowledged purpose of hate crimes. In January, I wrote here hate crimes serve two purposes: “One is to hurt the random victims at hand, the other is to threaten, intimidate and traumatize everyone like them.” I argued there are two sets of victims and two different crimes, each of which deserves punishment. One is the direct attack on a victim or victims, while the second is “to inflict trauma on the wider class of victims, it does just that. It is a threat, a form of intimidation against every member of the class. It is a form of terrorism.”
This terrorist admitted as much, the purpose of his hate crime was to intimidate all immigrants, not just to kill a select few. He wrote a list of goals for his terror attack and one was: “To directly reduce immigration rates to European lands by intimidating and physically removing the invaders themselves.”
Why He Used Guns
A secondary goal was to goad individuals on the Left into pushing for gun control. He says he chose to use guns in order to push precisely that agenda in order to “create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States.” He believes if the Left can be pushed into trying to weaken Second Amendment rights this will splinter the country, resulting in “a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US along political, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines.”
He wants Americans divided and wanted to use his armed attack as a way of doing this. By pitting the nation against itself he claimed the result would be “racial separation of the people within the United States ensuring the future of the White race on the North American continent, but also ensuring the death of the ‘melting pot’ pipe dream.”
In his manifesto he said he had various choices of weapons but chose guns because anti-Second Amendment activists would assure his crime got extra media attention. He hoped to pressure them to “seek to abolish the second amendment” in order to rip the country apart. In a part where he asks himself question he asked: “Won’t your attack result in calls for the removal of gun rights from Whites in the United States?” His answer: “Yes, that is the plan all along…”
His Enemies are Diversity, Individualism and Capitalism
This criminal says he was motivated by seeing “invaders” take over France — by which he means Muslims. The other was his rabid hatred for French President Emmanuel Macron. The alleged problem with Macron is he’s “a globalist, capitalist, egalitarian, an ex-investment banker was (sic) no national beliefs other than the pursuit of profit.”
The criminal killer said he will be called a fascist but that’s okay with him.
For once, the person that will be called a fascist, is an actual fascist…
I mostly agree with Sir Oswald Mosley’s [founder the British Union of Fascists, 1932–1940] and consider myself an Eco-fascist by nature.
The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People’s Republic of China. [Communist China]
He said he admired Trump as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose” but not as “a policy maker and leader.” If anything he sounds more like Bernie Sanders claiming he’s for worker “ownership of the means of production” depending “on who those workers are, their intents, who currently owns the means of production, their intents and who currently owns the state, and its intents.”
He said another influence on him was Candace Owens of the right-wing campus group Turning Point, USA. “Each time she spoke I was stunned by her insights and her own views helped push me further and further into the belief of violence over meekness.” He did not go into details here.
He buys entirely into the populist imagery of Trump, Sanders and others on both Right and Left, describing modern politics as “rule by our enemies. The global and corporate ran press controls them” and the state is run by “corporate backers” with an anti-white agenda.
When he asked himself if he blames immigrants and not capitalists, he writes, “I blame both, and plan to deal with both.” He claims, “The natural environment is industrialized, pulverized and commoditized.”
Western culture is trivialized, pulped and blended into a smear of meaningless nothing, with the only tenets and beliefs seemingly held to are the myth of the individual, the value of work (productivity for the benefit of your capitalist owners) and the sovereignty of property (to ensure none of us get grand ideas of taking the unearned wealth of our owners.)
In the end, he says nothing “has been conserved other than corporate profits and the the (sic) ever increasing wealth of the 1% that exploit the people for their own benefit.”
He attacks the idea of diversity, “Diversity is not strength. Unity, purpose, trust, traditions, nationalism and racial nationalism is what provides strength.” Along with diversity other enemies of his social order is “consumerism and individualism, where every individual is a competitor and the rights of the individual override all notions of responsibility. In this hell the individual is all and the race is worthless….”
He attacks the United States directly: “In the United States, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the cult of the individual has been practiced for the longest time and with the deepest devotion.” He makes clear why individualism is evil to him, it leads to what he says is a “deracialized” culture. Abandon the herd, embrace the individual and you stop being racist — that’s why he hates individualism.
As he sees it this means the West is a world where “an individual in a society worshiping the cult of the individual” is unable to repel “an influx of outsiders” who have the herd mentality he says white Westerners must adopt for themselves. He sees the West dying because “individualist insanity.”
Blame the Capitalists
Everything comes downs to immigrants and their destruction of the environment, according to this killer. The reason we have the problem with immigrants, he says, is corporate capitalism. “The economic elites …line their pockets with the profit received from our own ethnic replacement These greed-filled bastards expect to replace our people with a race of low intellect, low agency, muddled, muddied masses just so their own wealth and power can increase.”
This really does remind of the tirade Bernie Sanders released when he damned open immigration as “a Koch brothers proposal.” Vox said Sander argued it’s a “right-wing scheme meant to flood the US with cheap labor and depress wages of native-born workers.” This is fundamentally what the terrorist in New Zealand is saying as well.
He makes the enemy of his fascist society clear: “If an ethnocentric European future is to be achieved global free markets and the trade of goods is to be discouraged at all costs.” He apparently thinks his master race is incapable of competing in world markets: “A Europe of nature, culture and sustainable living practicing will not be able to ever compete in the global market.” He and Trump seem to agree, “Barring the importation of all goods produced outside the New European zone (the new Western world) is an essential pillar of the future Western economy.”
One of the saddest ironies out all of this is New Zealand is currently ruled by a Labour government coalition, one that embraces meany of the claims made by the terrorist himself. The Labour government is anti-capitalist, anti-corporate, and entered into a coalition government with an anti-immigration party known as New Zealand First. They went so far as to make the vile leader of that party the Deputy Prime Minister in their government. And that is something for which Prime Minister Jacida Ardern should be made to answer.
This is part of a three part series. Part one The Demented Politics of the New Zealand Terrorist covers the doctrines and hate espoused by the Christchurch terrorist. Part two, Trump, Hate and Terror covers the rhetoric of Donald Trump and how he and the terrorist are echo chambers using the same language. Part three is New Zealand’s Prime Minister Helped Promote Hate for Immigrants, which shows how Labour entered a coalition with right-wing anti-immigrant nationalists.

Energized state Democrats rally in Missoula - Missoula Current
Energized state Democrats rally in Missoula
Montana Democrats gathered Saturday in Missoula for the annual Pat and Carol Williams Dinner.
By Martin Kidston/MISSOULA CURRENT
Montana Democrats up and down the party ticket converged in Missoula on Saturday night for the annual Williams Dinner, where talk of the coming election and the likelihood of a particular Clinton stopping in the state led the conversation.
Democrats also have their sights set on regaining the majority in the state Senate this year, taking back Montana’s lone seat in Congress, and sending Gov. Steve Bullock back for a second term in Helena.
“We do think we could get the majority in the Senate this session,” said state Rep. Ellie Hill, D-Missoula. “I think turnout is going to be high because of the governor’s race. But we also know historically that turnout is high in a presidential year, so with someone like Hillary Clinton and likely Donald Trump, turnout will be very high.”
Montana Democrats saw a disastrous election in 2010, something they blame on low-voter turnout. It was an off-year election that saw roughly half of all registered voters show up at the polls. It also saw state Republicans gain 18 seats in the House, notching the largest victory achieved by either party in 46 years.
“The 2010 election just saw a record-low turnout,” said state Rep. Diane Sands, D-Missoula. “Unless you have the interest of both an exciting statewide and national race, most people don’t take the election as seriously as they should. But this year, because of Gov. Bullock, Hillary Clinton and Denise Juneau, we’ll have the turnout we need.”
Juneau, who has spent the last eight years serving as superintendent of public instruction, also believes the party has a strong lineup of candidates heading into this year’s election.
Juneau is running against first-term Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke in the state’s congressional race. She’s been touring Indian County to win the endorsement from tribal councils, and to ensure the state’s Native Americans are registered to vote.
“People seem be energized around the Democratic Party,” Juneau said. “They see what the other side is presenting and don’t want to go down that path. We’re not here to build a larger wall, we’re here to build a longer table and ensure all voices get included and that everyone has a seat,”
Sen. Jon Tester was also in Missoula over the weekend, where he attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Missoula Food Bank.
While the presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will likely be settled before the state’s June primary, Tester said, state voters will have other choices to make.
“We need leadership that’s going to stick up for working families and small businesses, and make college affordable,” Tester said. “We’ve got a great governor in Bullock who needs to get reelected. He’s done an amazing job creating jobs and making sure the people are able to enjoy the outdoors. Juneau is incredibly connected with working families and education.”
Jeff Essmann, executive director of the Montana Republican Party, believes the state GOP has the advantage heading into election season. He said his party’s line of candidates is the strongest it has been in more than 30 years.
All but Gregg Gianforte, who’s running for governor, has run a campaign before, Essmann said.
“I believe Zinke has been a great representative for the state,” Essmann said. “He’s hard on important issues like national security and the needs of our veterans.
“Montanans understand that we need a proven job creator to pick things up in Helena to get us out of this rut were in,” he added. “What we’ve been doing has not worked in Washington or Montana. We need a change.”
Sands and Hill said Montana Democrats may see a Clinton in the state before June.
“We haven’t seen much political action by either party in the state,” said Sands. “We’ll see a major political figure in here before the primary. Maybe even Hillary.”

Assad Undermines Palestinian Cause For His Own Petty Gains
June 6, 2011 by Mitchell Plitnick
According to reports on Syrian television, 23 people were killed along the border with Israel as they tried to go across the border with Israel.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) disputed the numberand the circumstances.
Syrian President Bashar Assad
Considering the sources of both the accusation and the denial, both highly dubious with long track records of dissembling, I’m keeping my mind open on this. But there are some very important points to be made about the violent confrontations on the northern border.
Let’s start with this: Uri Avnery was right when he said the IDF used disproportionate force. The IDF itself said all the injuries were on the Syrian side of the border—this is why they say they cannot confirm any casualties. The IDF also says they shot live fire at the legs of protesters heading toward the border fence, but still on the Syrian side. Hard to see how that can be called proportionate force. And at least one witness, a journalist, said that the Israelis are understating the severity of their response.
Let’s also be clear about another point: Israel is not defending its borders here. The Golan Heights, which is the area Israel is defending in these incidents, is occupied territory, internationally recognized as Syrian. Unlike the West Bank, which is claimed by the Palestinians but was not previously part of any sovereign state (it was occupied by Jordan from 1949-1967 and part of Mandatory Palestine before that), the Golan is Syrian, and Israel’s annexation of it in 1981 is illegal and recognized by no other country, including the United States.
So, Israel is not defending its borders here, but is defending its occupation. And herein lies the problem, because what is happening on the Syrian border, though certainly heartfelt and significant, is counter-productive for the Palestinians.
Israel has made a very big deal of the fact that Bashar Assad has used the confrontations with Israel as “a distraction” from the ongoing protests in Syria and the murderous actions Assad has taken in response to them.
They’re not wrong, of course. And, while Assad has utterly failed to distract any international attention from his aggression against Syrian citizens fighting for their rights, he is harping on the one issue – getting the Golan Heights back – which resonates with virtually all Syrians across the political spectrum. It helps him to retain the loyalty of the military and other sectors which still support him, but even at that, it’s only marginally useful.
Assad’s cynical use of the Palestinian issue would not, in and of itself, be so objectionable. If it was helping the Palestinians to make their case, it merely becomes an issue that serves dual interests. It certainly has done nothing to quell the protests within Syria or the criticism of them outside, so, from the Palestinian point of view, what would be the harm?
But there is harm. The harm is visible in the coverage of the recent protests. They have focused on the Syrian “infiltration” quite naturally, because that is where the killing has been. It takes attention away from areas where Palestinians have been fighting the occupation directly. And it serves to muddy the picture.
The situation in the Golan Heights is very different from the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Very few of the native inhabitants remained in the Golan after Israel captured it in 1967. While few of them accepted Israeli citizenship, they do not face the restrictions that Palestinians on the West Bank do.
While it is certainly important to remind the world that the Golan is not legally Israeli, right now it allows Bibi to argue that these actions are “attacks” on Israel’s borders.
Again, if it was just about the Golan, that would make some sense, although the loss of life is too high a price to pay (a reality for which both Assad’s cynical machinations and the IDF’s excessive force must be held to account) to remind the world that the Golan isn’t Israel.
Because the Golan doesn’t feature the trappings of a military occupation as the West Bank does, it makes it much easier to paint the protests as an attack on Israel proper, and because of Syria’s involvement it makes it easier for Israel to paint this as an attack on its very existence. It’s not.
Meanwhile, the media in Israel and internationally largely ignored the other protests yesterday. Dozens of Palestinians were injured at Qalandia, near Jerusalem yesterday, but that protest was hardly covered at all.
This is not only the result of Assad supporting the protests, of course. Palestinian protesters had planned to symbolically “return” to Israel from numerous directions, but it is very difficult to do it from Egypt while Lebanon and Jordan have enacted measures to prevent such actions.
All Assad is doing is to simply allow the protests to happen.
But this is enough to divert and dilute the message of the protests, and it is to the detriment of the actions the Palestinians are trying to take.

Popular, largely non-violent actions by the Palestinians are all the more crucial now that the Obama Administration has made it clear that it will shield Israel from Palestinian diplomatic action and will only permit pursuit of a two-state solution inside the obviously failed Oslo framework.
Under those circumstances, the involvement of Bashar Assad cannot help the cause, it can only hurt. He taints the actions on the international level, and given what he is doing to Arab protesters, his support adds nothing in terms of the Arab world.
Of course, the tainting of these actions is actually done by Israel, as it plays Assad’s involvement to the hilt and distorts what is going on—claiming that this is a Syrian engineered action, rather than one that Assad is simply letting happen. Assad’s cynicism is more than matched by Israel’s, and none of this excuses the excessive force Israel has employed twice now to defend territory they claim is Israel, when it is, in fact, occupied Syrian territory.
But given the current state of affairs, Israel is acting rationally, and it’s not very reasonable to expect it to act differently.
Assad, on the other hand, is gaining very little by doing this and he’s seriously diminishing the effect these protests could be having for the Palestinian cause. He needs to stop, and one can only hope that the Palestinian protesters, or even the PA, would call on him to do so.

Panthers ink DT Short to $80M deal
The Panthers locked up defensive tackle Kawaan Short on a long-term deal Monday.
April 17, 2017 NSJ Staff Sports
Dec 11
Defensive tackle Kawann Short signed a five-year contract with the Carolina Panthers the team announced on Monday. According to a report from ESPN, the deal is worth $80 million over five years and NFL Network reports that Short will receive $40 million over the first four years. The Panthers kept Short from free agency with the non-exclusive franchise tag on Feb. 27, but coach Ron Rivera called him one of the team’s most important players and “too valuable to lose.””KK has been very important to what we’ve been able to accomplish on defense,” general manager Dave Gettleman said. “In 2013, when we drafted KK, I thought he was the best pass-rushing defensive tackle in the Draft, and he’s been able to develop into one of the top young defensive tackles in the NFL. Off the field, KK is a top-notch young man and great representative of our team. I’m absolutely thrilled that we were able to get this deal done.”Short, second-round pick in 2013 out of Purdue, has 22 career sacks.”KK consistently affects the quarterback and is strong against the run,” head coach Ron Rivera said. “The mismatches he creates for us on defense force opponents to be aware of him at all times and give us an edge along the defensive line. He’s a great player, but also a quality young man who has the respect of his teammates in the locker room. He’s everything we’re looking for in a Panther.”Short was scheduled to make $13.1 million on the franchise tag with a fully guaranteed contract in 2017.

PALO ALTO, CALIF.
It’s nothing more than a dune buggy on a cordoned-off street, but it’s headed for trouble.
A jumble of sawhorses and traffic cones simulates a road crew working over a manhole, and the driverless car must decide: Obey the law against crossing a double-yellow line, or break the law and spare the crew. It splits the difference, veering at the last moment and nearly colliding with the cones.
“I imagine that wasn’t the most comfortable experience for you,” Chris Gerdes, a boyish and bespectacled Stanford engineering professor, calls out to the slightly shaken passenger in the car.
Gerdes is suddenly causing a great deal of discomfort to automakers and tech giants. Raised in North Carolina in the shadow of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, he has been at the enthusiastic forefront of the driverless-car movement, monitoring the brains of top racecar drivers in action and programming cars to imitate them.
But as the autonomous-car movement barrels ahead, Gerdes has gone from enthusiast to conscience, if not quite scold. He’s raising questions about ethical choices that must inevitably be programmed into the robotic minds expected one day soon to be driving along the nation’s highways. And since Gerdes, who favors blue jeans and straight talk, is no tweedy Luddite railing against the evils of technology, the industry is paying attention; top executives are pouring into his lab in Palo Alto.
“Within the autonomous driving industry, Chris is regarded as Switzerland. He’s neutral,” said Patrick Lin, a philosophy professor at Cal Poly who spent a year working with Gerdes in his seven-bay garage filled with robot cars.
“He’s asking the hard questions about ethics and how it’s going to work,” Lin added. “He’s pointing out that we have to do more than just obey the law.”
On a recent day, Gerdes met separately at his lab with the chief executive officers of General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. That came about a week after he hosted a workshop on driverless ethics for 90 engineers and researchers, including from electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc. and tech giant Google Inc., which has pledged to put out a robot car as soon as 2017.
This year, Tesla will introduce an auto-pilot feature. GM will debut a 2017 Cadillac that drives hands free. Ford CEO Mark Fields says driverless cars will arrive by 2020.
Gerdes’ message: not so fast.
“People often say the technology is solved, but I don’t quite believe that,” he said in the conference room as his students nearby buried their heads under the hood of an autonomous Ford Fusion nicknamed Trudy. “There’s a lot of context, a lot of subtle but important things yet to be solved.”
Take that double-yellow line problem. It’s clear that the car should cross it to avoid the road crew. Less clear is how to go about programming a machine to break the law or to make still more complex ethical calls.
Gerdes, 46, who is training to be a racecar driver, initially dismissed the need to grapple with philosophy.
Autonomous cars programmed with robot reflexes and precision were on track to drastically reduce the 33,000 US highway deaths a year. Wasn’t that moral enough? But then three years ago George Bekey, co-author with Lin of a book entitled “Robot Ethics,” e-mailed Gerdes.
“My first thought was, ‘Ethics? Automated cars? This seems like a bit of a fringe topic,’ ” Gerdes said.
He soon came to see both its significance and its painful complexity. For example, when an accident is unavoidable, should a driverless car be programmed to aim for the smallest object to protect its occupant? What if that object turns out to be a baby stroller? If a car must choose between hitting a group of pedestrians and risking the life of its occupant, what’s the moral choice? Does it owe its occupant more than it owes others?
When human drivers face impossible dilemmas, choices are made in the heat of the moment and can be forgiven. But if a machine can be programmed to make the choice, what should it be?
In a nod to “Back to the Future,” Gerdes will unveil later this month a self-driving DeLorean nicknamed Marty.
It’s clear, then, that even as he raises hard questions Gerdes believes in this quest.
“With any new technology, there’s a peak in hype and then there’s a trough of disillusionment,” Gerdes said. “We’re somewhere on that hype peak at the moment. The benefits are real, but we may have a valley ahead of us before we see all of the society-transforming benefits of this sort of technology.”

Tech City Spinning Visa Failure
Following revelations that the government’s inept technology quango Tech City had only managed to dole out 7 of its allocated 200 Exceptional Talent visas, their Chairwoman Baroness Shields has surfaced in the Times to explain things. Apparently the failure to get more than 10 people to apply for the valuable visas is a sign of the UK being a “global tech hub”:
“With nine individuals accepted since launch, the figure of 200 is not a target but rather a maximum allowance. This is testament to the UK’s leadership as a global tech hub considering this is the first year for the visa route.”
Funny then, that Shields’ taxpayer funded organisation refused to admit how many visas they had allocated until they were forced to do so by an FOI. The equivalent US Visa scheme was oversubscribed by 87,500…

Quote of the Day
Dr Alexander Kogan, the app developer who originally harvested the Facebook data, said…
“I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic and made claims this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it’s not that. If you sit down and you really work through the statistics and you think what does a correlation of point three means, those claims quickly fall apart. And that’s something any person with a statistical background can go and do.”

Aubrey O’Day Allegedly Filmed Topless Music Video in Response to Donald Trump Jr. Affair

It looks like "DJT" isn't the only song Aubrey O'Day may have recorded about her alleged fling with Donald Trump Jr.
TMZ obtained previously unreleased footage of a video O'Day filmed for her rework of Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know," reportedly filmed back in 2012 following her alleged affair with Trump's son.
In the clip, O'Day can be seen topless with words like "cheater," seduction," "hate" and "liar" scrawled across her body as she sings reworked lyrics about a failed relationship with a married man.
"You said that was the reason for your pain / But you were scared to ruin your family's name / Your wife's the only one glad we are over," the former Danity Kane star sings.
Watch a clip, below:
Earlier this week, after rumors circulated that O'Day and Trump Jr. had an affair while the singer was on Celebrity Apprentice, fans dug up the lyrics to an old song off O'Day's debut album.
The song, titled "DJT" (also Donald John Trump Jr.'s initials), seemed to be about the pair's infidelities, with lyrics like, "You wanna, you wanna believe that everything with me was a lie? A fantasy? / And you want to go back and live in the life that you had have forever?"

Landmark Lawsuit Claims Monsanto Hid Cancer Danger of Roundup for Decades
May 25, 2018 at 6:58 pm
Lawsuit alleges Monsanto suppressed evidence linking RoundUp to non-Hodgkin lymphoma
“Monsanto has long been aware of the risk that its glyphosate-based herbicides are carcinogenic … but has continuously sought to influence the scientific literature to prevent its internal concerns from reaching the public sphere,” wrote San Francisco Superior Court Judge Curtis Karnow in an order he issued last week, fast tracking the case of a 46 year-old father of 3 dying of cancer.
California groundskeeper DeWayne Johnson’s case is at the forefront of a larger legal battle, in which 4,000 plaintiffs have sued Monsanto alleging exposure to Roundup caused them, or their loved ones, to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Johnson, who has months to live, hopes to get Monsanto to take responsibility for his fate before he dies.
His case goes a step further than the 4000 other plaintiffs’, alleging not only that Monsanto’s weedkiller causes cancer, but that they company has known about it for decades and has aggressively hidden the information from regulators and the public.
Monsanto “championed falsified data and attacked legitimate studies” and led a “prolonged campaign of misinformation” to convince government agencies, farmers and consumers that Roundup was safe, Johnson’s lawsuit states.
The lawsuit points to a long list of studies suggesting the active ingredient in Monsanto’s herbicides — glyphosate — is can lead to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015.
They also cite research showing showing Roundup’s glyphosate formula is more toxic than glyphosate alone.

“We look forward to exposing how Monsanto hid the risk of cancer and polluted the science,” Johnson’s attorney Michael Miller told The Guardian. “Monsanto does not want the truth about Roundup and cancer to become public.”
Monsanto has fiercely denied the allegations, pointing to findings by the Environmental Protection Agency in its defense.
According to the court record, Johnson had a job as a school groundskeeper, where he applied numerous treatments of Monsanto’s herbicides from 2012 until 2015. He was healthy and active before he got the cancer diagnosis in August 2014.
In a January deposition, Johnson’s treating physician testified that more than 80% of his body was covered by lesions, and that he probably had only a few months to live.
The trial will proceed on June 18. A jury will be allowed to consider punitive damages.

Monsanto has bought off our government officials and their latest ‘best buddy’ scott pruit will never shut them down. It is up to the public to close this company down by just NOT buying their products and demanding that our government officials do their jobs right.

My husband worked on a dairy farm and handled Round up and other herbicides and pesticides every year around planting time. He suffered for a year and a half with non Hodgkin lymphoma before succumbing to it it 1998. He was only 31 years old. Back then,it was only a suspicion by medical professionals that the cause could be the chemicals used in farming and other professions. I know it is too late now to file a law suit but am so happy to finally know that they will be brought to justice. I can never bring my Doug back but knowing that finally there is an answer gives me closure and an answer to the cause.

I totally agree.
I develop in last 10 year big intolerance to gluten, then last year I decided to grow up my own wheat in very natural way. I made my own bread and pasta with the harvest grain and my intolerance totally disappeared.

Indiana case likely social-media precedent
Posted Thursday, February 22, 2018 4:00 pm
The legal community took notice last week of what might be the first-in-the-nation case of court-ordered damages awarded over a defamatory social media post. The case shows that people no matter where they live should be very careful what they post on social media.
The (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette reported that Zerlie Charles was awarded $6,000 in Scott Superior Small Claims Court after the court ruled she was defamed in a Facebook post by Vickie D. Vest, who had dated Charles’ son before he died in 2015. Vest reported Robert Charles’ truck stolen a few days after his death and, in a Facebook post, accused Zerlie Charles of the theft.
A different trial court judge initially ruled the case failed to meet the standard for defamation. But Zerlie Charles’ attorneys won a reversal in October at the Indiana Court of Appeals, which also noted that Vest admitted she stole the truck. The appellate panel remanded the case for a determination of money damages for Charles.
The plaintiff’s attorneys asked the appellate court to publish its memorandum decision, arguing there were few defamation per se rulings in case law, and that the popularity of Facebook “makes these facts and legal conclusions of substantial public importance,” and “publication of this opinion can caution clients against the improper use” of Facebook.
“A lay person probably feels they have a First Amendment right to say whatever they want to, but that’s definitely not the case if you’re harming people with what you’re saying,” plaintiff’s lawyer said. That’s something worth noting.

Robots to invade book store
Posted Wednesday, October 28, 2015 4:00 pm
NEW HARTFORD — Over a dozen robots will be running around the isles of the Barnes and Noble store on Nov. 7-8. It’s not an invasion, it’s all a part of the first Nationwide Mini-Maker Faire taking place at Barnes and Noble stores.
Locally, the RoboSpartans 4082 and JavaScouts 9984 FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams will demonstrate their competition robots along with a large assortment of LEGO robots and 3D Printers at the Commercial Drive location on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Maker Faire Presentations on Saturday include: Building LEGO Robots at 1 p.m., FTC Robots at 5 p.m., and 3D Printing Prosthetic Hands & Quadcopters (Drones) at 7 p.m. On Sunday: FTC Robotics at 1 p.m. and 3D Printing at 5 p.m.
The 3D Printing presentations will include information on prosthetics created by robotics teams on behalf of e-NABLE/enablingthefuture.org, a group of Worldwide volunteers who create “helping hands” for those in need.The RoboSpartans introduced e-NABLE to FIRST Tech Challenge teams this season and recently joined forces with 19 teams in the U.S. and Australia to produce hand components that will soon be assembled by engineering college students at SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Utica for volunteer projects in 3rd-World Countries. The RoboSpartans are also involved in the e-NABLE Matching Project where they are matched with those in-need on a more local basis.
In addition to the ongoing weekend demonstrations, the two New Hartford based robotics teams will be hosting Bookfair fundraisers during the Maker Faire. The teams will receive donations based on a portion of purchases made at the store and online from customers using Barnes and Noble Bookfair Codes. Coupons will be available at the robotics demonstration areas around the store and online on both team’s Facebook pages and websites.
The RoboSpartans are the area’s oldest and longest running robotics team. They’ve competed in the 2013 and 2015 FIRST Tech Challenge World Championship where they received Finalist recognition for their league’s top prize, the Inspire Award. As the senior team, they offer mentorship to those interested in learning robotics and facilitate a Worldwide engineering collaborative of over 150 student robotics teams. Their FTC TEC Network Community gives robotics teams a platform to share their knowledge and gain valuable contacts that can last through college and beyond. Teams meet through Google Hangouts, community postings and independent online chats. More information on the RoboSpartans can be obtained through the website: www.RoboSpartans.org or by emailing RoboSpartans4082@gmail.com.
The JavaScouts 9984 are a rookie FIRST Tech Challenge team formed through Boy Scout Troop 4 in New Hartford. This is their 3rd year competing in the FIRST competitions, but the first in FTC. Before robotics, the JavaScouts had been camping and Scouting together since 2009. In the 2013 FLL competition, they won the prestigious Project Award for the proposed design of an anti-tsunami wall. In 2014’s competition they won another FLL Project Award for a Virtual Reality teaching aid. 2015 is their rookie year in FTC and they have high hopes, but just want to follow the scout mottos: “Do your best” and “Be Prepared”. More information on the JavaScouts can be obtained through their Facebook page at: www.facebook.com/javascouts or via email at kirkevans@gmail.com.

To reach Paris Agreement Objectives : cut GHG emissions now !
In News And Views by admin January 28, 2017 Leave a Comment
COP21 was the last chance meeting to reach an international agreement on climate change.
COP23 is the last chance meeting to engage successful Climate Action. Why ?
Because, if we want to stop GLOBAL WARMING now, 2018 is the last year to engage fast GHG reduction and reach:
+1.5°C : requiring -7% GHG emissions per year
+2°C : requiring -5% GHG emissions per year
Each extra year will cost +0.1°C of global warming, so it needs to be decided now by COP22 and COP23 leaders #COP22 #COP23
This is the findings of fairly small research teams at The Shift Project and Saving Our Planet. Both NGOs have independently conducted straightforward investigations of what needed to be done to fulfill the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change signe at COP21 in 2015. The beauty of the process is that both teams worked independently during COP22… only to find out that they had addressed the same question and come to similar conclusions when posting the results on Twitter !
And those results are surprisingly consistent not only between one another, but also with previous estimates of the required GHG emission reduction targets for the Paris Agreement :
Now, these results will be shared with more expert groups. But everyone can now take a measure of what is required to prevent even more catastrophic consequences of the ongoing climate transition.

STOP : arrêtons le #réchauffementclimatique maintenant ! Réduire rapidement les emissions de #GES dès 2018 permettrait d’atteindre les objectifs de l’Accord de Paris sur le Climat de la COP21 :
+ 1.5°C : -7 % d’émissions de GES par an (estimation de Saving Our Planet)
+ 2°C : -5 % d’émissions de GES par an (estimation de The Shift Project)
Chaque année supplémentaire coûtera + 0.1°C de réchauffement global de la planète, donc demandons-le maintenant aux COP22 et COP23 #COP22#COP23

The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science
By Norman Doidge
Synopsis: An astonishing new science called “neuroplasticity” is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable. In this revolutionary look at the brain, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Norman Doidge, M.D., provides an introduction to both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they’ve transformed. From stroke patients learning to speak again to the remarkable case of a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole,The Brain That Changes Itself will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.

Browsing online on the Herald, though God knows why I do, I see where a woman, Australian born, who has lived here since she was 4 years old, 38 years old now, has been diagnosed with terminal melanoma. She does not qualify for free treatment here and although 31 weeks pregnant, she has to return to Australia for her treatment and early birth of her baby.
With all our disgust of how New Zealanders are treated over the ditch in not being able to receive help, even when they pay taxes to provide for such help, isn’t it a bit rich of us when we are doing the same thing to fellow neighbours from over the ditch who have lived here for many years. I understand that recent arrivals have to pay for their medical help but isn’t this going a bit too far for this woman who has lived here for years. What a nasty old world we live in.

Read this and be appalled:
http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/28/a-phonecall-a-meeting-then-indefinite-detention-the-refugees-at-the-mercy-of-asio
This is exactly the same secretive administrative regime that is detaining and deporting New Zealanders.
The point so many people fail to understand, is that the rule changes Abbott passed early this year mean that:
1. If you are deemed to have failed the new retrospective rules then arrest is mandatory.
2. Indefinite detention is mandatory
3. You do not have to be told why you have been detained or on what grounds
4. There is NO legal appeal
5. The Minister of Immigration has sole discretion
The UN has condemned this regime, and there was real disquiet when Abbott rammed these changes through under the guise of ‘fighting terrorism’. It’s application to New Zealanders who have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism is obnoxious and wrong.
Kind of like their cricket team now I come to think of it.

Here is some interesting new OIA information that was released by MSD on 19 Nov. 2015 (see also questions/answers 18 and 19 re Mental Health Employment Service and Sole Parent Employment Service outcomes). As usual, the response has raised more questions than answers, and some info has been withheld (some without any reason), other info appears to have selectively been made available.
A post on another blog covers all this:
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/msds-selective-and-poor-responses-to-new-oia-requests-on-benefits-advisors-reports-mental-health-and-sole-parent-employment-services/
An earlier post that also contained OIA data on MHES and SPES and much more:
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/mental-health-and-sole-parent-employment-services-msd-withholds-o-i-a-information-that-may-prove-their-trials-a-failure/
And here is a post showing how MSD and their Principal Advisor on Health selectively use statistical and other information, and misrepresent it to push their agendas:
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/msd-and-dr-david-bratt-present-misleading-evidence-claiming-worklessness-causes-poor-health/
PDFs with the new OIA response from MSD, and also with the sets of questions that were asked:
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/msd-oia-rqst-dr-bratt-mhes-spes-waa-reports-winz-sundry-data-08-07-reply-anon-19-11-15.pdf
High-lit version:
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/msd-oia-rqst-dr-bratt-hd-panel-mhes-spes-waa-reports-reply-hi-lit-19-11-15.pdf
Questions put to MSD:
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/msd-o-i-a-request-to-c-e-of-m-s-d-base-benefit-break-down-anon-08-07-15.pdf
https://nzsocialjusticeblog2013.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/msd-o-i-a-request-to-c-e-of-msd-bratt-hd-panel-reforms-anon-08-07-15.pdf
Now why can our MSM not deliver any such information? Sorry, they do mostly seem to be under-resourced, unable to do a proper job, or are indifferent and rather spend time on discussing different flags and help the government stir up yet more fear about possible terror attacks in NZ. And lest we forget, there is always the weather, crime, lots of sports and celebrity news to report on. And who and what is “trending” on Twitt-err?

So most on “the left” do not seem to give much of a shit about this kind of info, but rather follow with obsession whatever MSM report, so they can then hit out at them? FFS if that is the state of affairs in this crap country, I have NO more hope for it!!!

Quote: The expert noted that the Doce River, one of Brazil’s great water sheds, “is now considered by scientists to be dead and the toxic sludge is slowly working its way downstream towards the Abrolhos National Marine Park where it threatens protected forest and habitat. Sadly the mud has already entered the sea at Regencia beach a sanctuary for endangered turtles and a rich source of nutrients that the local fishing community relies upon.”
We are killing this planet one river at a time….and nothing will be done about it, lest we hinder progress and growth and export n shite.

Hey! This sounds very brave, very exciting and innovative. Great leadership!
“An Auckland high school is skipping NCEA Level 1 to reduce assessment stress for its students, giving the teenagers an extra year before facing exams.
Hobsonville Point Secondary School says the first year of the NCEA qualification is unnecessary as it doesn’t lead to anywhere except further schooling……
The school, which opened last year, said it made the decision to switch to a two-year NCEA Level 2 programme after reviewing a national report on student wellbeing which found schools were over-assessing children, leading to anxiety, depression and eating disorders.
“Why would we do that to them?” said principal Maurie Abraham. “We found the kids weren’t enjoying learning, and were instead ticking boxes. Our approach changes the focus to deep learning, rather than chasing credits.”

This is an interesting step. But the gap between Level 1 NCEA and Level 2 is huge. A lot will not be able to cope with it. Those are the ones who need Level 1 – it shows basic literacy, numeracy and general understanding of subjects studied. That’s may be all some students are capable of, but that capacity should be acknowledged.
Of more concern is the hothousing and credit farming that is becoming endemic in schools. This is not a problem with NCEA as such (scaling exams so 50% passed and 50% failed was just as bad) but is a result of the pressure on schools to improve on results. The Ministry target for NCEA Level 1 is 85% pass rate (Which makes it pretty meaningless as a qualification). In a lot of cases, this can only be achieved by hothousing and downright cheating at an institutional level, because 85% of students are not capable of passing NCEA Level 1, at least not over the course of a single year.
But no school wants to be identified as a failing school, because then Bright Flight happens – the capable students are sent to other schools and the cycle is confirmed.

I wish we could move away from this continual cycle of assessment. A useful analogy is that weighing the pig all the time does not increase its weight. Have just observed my youngest child’s NCEA level one year. Start school in February. Practice exams in September, more revision then NCEA exams November to December. She is currently on holiday until the start of next year. So effectively only seven months when they learn new stuff. Just imagine what they could learn and discover if it wasn’t for all these pesky assessments.

Not to mention that huge slabs of the so-called ‘curricula’ consist of doing assigned work for internal assessment anyway and chunks of the week to week programme are reserved for this. For a bright or more widely interested students things can be pretty tedious.

The Nats and there friends at the Herald are spinning the line that there are only minor changes to the RMA proposed. See here:
http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11552680
This is NOT true. Let me repeat; NOT true.
The changes proposed to S.95A of the Act mean that NO residential subdivision and/or development will be able to be publicly notified regardless of adverse effects. This means that the checks and balances of public submission and the ability to appeal to the Environment Court will be removed completely from ALL residential subdivisions and developments.
The result will be that in places such as Queenstown or Wanaka visually intrusive residential developments promoted by well-resourced developers will inevitably gain consent from (specially chosen, often poorly trained) commissioners without any public input. This is a disaster for NZ’s landscapes in the making.
Why on earth have the Maori Party signed up to this?
S.95A should be kept as it it is. In its current form it does not hold back residential development. The Nats are simply using this as an excuse to change it.
One can only hope that Dunne and the Maori Party realise the the disastrous effects of this change before it is too late.
The change also flies in the face of a central tenet of the RMA-public involvement.

There seems to be a wish to fast track things behind tis RMA overturning. This is in my opinion, one of the main factors that influenced the Christchurch City Council building management section to be so careless with the controls and demands on the building that went down in the earthquake. The hegemony at that time was the same careless, feckless one presently coming from government.
We should take this gummint before the Trade Practices tribunal or whatever decides that the public has been sold a sick pup and left with an article that is not fit for purpose. I want an intelligent government that acts carefully and effectively not a bunch of buccaneer cowboys knocking down fences meant to offer protection from danger and reliable stability.

I was peripherally listening to that.
Much of what he was saying was very good…but the bit about making bus shelters into something that sounded like entertainment zones threw me.( As Kim pointed out…everyone has devices!) And the one meter square of grass needed to supply the urban dwellers with the required amount of aerial gut biota was a bit woowooish!
I would have though grass verges and urban green spaces would have provided enough bug populated turf.
I’ll listen again later…

The USA seems to be quite a violent, lawless place. And of course they assassinate their leaders from time to time. On top of that they have a religious fundamentalist group that thinks nothing of preventing people having human rights and freedom.
It is not surprising that we hear so much bad stuff about the USA. Any place where people feel they have to have a gun to protect themselves against lurking dangers, (mostly their family or neighbours), must be a country not yet civilised, or one on the way down.

On antiobiotics which the news about has lately been negative. They are becoming ineffective because they have been used profligately as prophylactics and because they seem to promote growth by the food industry. Now some boffin is sounding hopeful about fighting the little bacteria b..gers.
This from RADIONZ. http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player/201780533
Last year the World Health Organisation warned that the world was heading towards a “…post-antibiotic era”.
Meanwhile, a study published in The Lancet last week described the discovery in China of a bug resistant to the polymyxins, the last class of fully effective antibiotics. More worryingly, this resistance can pass between bacteria, raising the prospect that polymyxin-resistant bugs could spread worldwide over the next few years.
So far, so gloomy…but is antibiotic resistance a problem that we can solve?
Bacteria have been around for billions of years, and in that time they’ve worked out how to fight off and kill other bugs muscling in on their turf.
They do this using a bacteriocin, a toxic protein that can target a specific species of bacteria; think sniper fire as opposed to the hand grenade approach employed today with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Professor Richard James of the University of Nottingham and other teams around the world are hoping that these bacteriocins will help us win the war against infection.

‘Firefox has prevented the outdated plugin “Adobe Flash” from running on thestandard.org.nz.
And this is without my presenting anything. Then it happened when I was testing to see what brought up the message and ran the mouse down the comments list on the right.
I had tried to put up a comment with two links to audio on Radionz but it wouldn’t accept them on the two times that I tried. While I have been refreshing to see where the comment has gone, I have had that message about taking up too much time and been locked out.

Starbucks could be in some deep trouble.
After President Trump’s 90-day travel ban against seven Middle Eastern countries was widely criticized by the left, the popular coffee stop put out a statement saying they wanted to combat the president’s executive order by hiring 10,000 refugees.
Bloomberg reports:
Starbucks Corp. Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz, who wrote he had a “heavy heart” over U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration order, said the company plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years around the world.
Starbucks is in direct contact with employees affected by the immigration ban and will do “everything possible to support and help them to navigate through this confusing period,” Schultz said in a letter to employees posted on the coffee chain’s website.
While that might fly in other countries, American law will not tolerate such discrimination against United States citizens.
According to the EEOC:
Under the laws enforced by EEOC, it is illegal to discriminate against someone (applicant or employee) because of that person’s race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. It is also illegal to retaliate against a person because he or she complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.
Good luck, Starbucks.
SHARE on Facebook and Twitter if you agree that Starbucks needs to drop their anti-American hiring policy!

The left has officially launched a massive assault on Fox News Host Sean Hannity.
After Fox News mysteriously retracted a story regarding the death of DNC Staffer Seth Rich, Hannity stood by the original report, which pointed to the Democrat party allegedly having involvement in the July 2016 murder.
In retaliation, Soros-funded organization Media Matters released a lengthy list of the talk-show host’s advertisers, demanding liberals contact them and ask they they stop business with Hannity.
Here’s the shocking they said about Hannity, right before providing the advertiser list:
“Sean Hannity is a professional propagandist for President Donald Trump, as well as a bigot, a sexist, and a conspiracy theorist. As host of Fox News’ Hannity, he has used his platform to advocate for authoritarian tactics toward the press, defend Trump’s obstruction of the investigation into collusion between the president’s associates and Russia, and attack judges who have ruled against Trump’s Muslim bans,” Media Matters stated.
Again, after the above anti-Hannity laceration, they listed around 50 advertisers for people to contact.

UAWire – NATO: Suspicions about Russia’s Zapad-2017 exercises were justified, the scale of the drills was much bigger than declared
NATO is confident that its suspicions concerning the Zapad 2017 Russian-Belarusian exercises were justified. “It will take several weeks for a full assessment, but it is already clear that the scale and the geographic coverage of the Zapad 2017 exercise turned out to be substantially larger than those declared initially by Moscow and Minsk,” as relayed by NATO spokeswoman, Oana Lungescu, to Süddeutsche Zeitung on Thursday, September 21st.According to her, these maneuvers were held not only in Belarus, Kaliningrad, the Leningrad region, and the Baltic Sea, as it had been announced before the beginning of the exercises. Simultaneously, “significant” drills were held in the Arctic, the Far East, the Black Sea near the border with Ukraine, as well as in Abkhazia. Russian authorities officially associated some of these drills with the Zapad 2017 maneuvers, Lungescu added. The North Atlantic Alliance believes that the Zapad-2017 exercise simulated a “vast conflict between the states” and that they used “a full range of Russian and Belarusian weapons,” including the Navy, submarines, fighter jets, tanks, artillery, and intercontinental ballistic missiles. NATO believes that, in fact, much more servicemen took part in the maneuvers than had been officially announced. Earlier, Minsk and Moscow reported about 12,700 military men. The alliance has not yet provided specific numbers, but they have mentioned “several tens of thousands of soldiers” involved in Zapad-2017. The Vienna Document of the OSCE obliges the host countries of military maneuvers to admit foreign observers if the number of personnel participating in them exceeds 13,000. The Zapad-2017 exercise was held from September 14th to 20th. Before it began, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin, claimed in an interview with DW that the maneuvers were exclusively defensive in nature and aimed at “working out the appropriate methods and use of the armed forces to combat terrorism.”
UAWire – Latvia: During Zapad-2017 exercises Russia rehearsed a blockade of the Baltics
The Ministry of Defense of Latvia has not yet released an official assessment of the Russia-Belarus joint exercises but Latvian Minister of Defense Raimonds Bergmanis informed Delfi news agency that many facts point to the Baltic blockade scenario being worked out already. Zapad 2017 officially ended on September 20. Although the active phase of the exercises is over, the Russian armed forces activities will continue, Bergmanis said. He noted that much attention was drawn to the exercises and, more importantly, to what happened before and after them. “Assessing the overall picture, in my opinion, many elements of the Baltic region blockade were being worked out,” the minister said. He added that the official analysis of the exercises has not yet been conducted so there was no need to rush to premature conclusions.

Pavel Felgenhauer | Lukashenka and Russian Officials Part Ways During Zapad 2017 | Jamestown
On September 18, the same Luzsky firing range was visited by President Vladimir Putin, together with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, top Russian military brass, multiple foreign journalists, and military attachés accredited in Moscow as observers. They arrived to witness Russian tanks, heavy guns, missiles, heavy flamethrowers, jet bombers and attack helicopters (including Ka-52s) firing live ammunition as part of the Zapad exercise. The visit by Putin and the other VIPs was officially declared a total success despite heavy rain and low cloud cover in Leningrad oblast. The one-day presence of 95 foreign military attachés at the live-fire show at the Luzsky range was affirmed as an act of openness—Russia allowing foreign observers to monitor Zapad 2017 (Militarynews.ru, September 18). Of course, due to the heavy rain and because they stayed for only several hours, those observers could hardly see much. Nonetheless, the overwhelming firepower of the Russian military was on full display. No other foreign observers were allowed to any other Zapad 2017–linked events inside Russia. But in Belarus, which unlike Russia is still a party to the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, foreign observers were allowed extended access to different locations during the entirety of the war game. The aforementioned Ka-52 incident was not reported by the Russian military. On September 17, the press service of the Western military district (ZVO) issued an upbeat statement about attack helicopters (including Ka-52s) successfully firing live ammo at decoys of enemy troops and vehicles (Militarynews.ru, September 17). The friendly-fire story became public only on September 19, when an Internet site published video evidence of the attack, apparently filmed by chance by an anonymous bystander (66.ru, September 19). The posted video shows two Ka-52s coming in hot at treetop level; the second helicopter suddenly fires a missile seemingly targeting real people and vehicles instead of decoys. The Russian military, after initial denials, acknowledged that the “the targeting system of one of the helicopters took on a wrong target.” A special commission was announced, which will investigate what went wrong: Was this the Ka-52 crew’s mistake or, as had been reported, did the attack chopper’s electronic command-and-control (C2) system fire “unintentionally” (Kommersant, September 20)? The Ka-52 is one of the most modern and electronically savvy Russian attack aircraft. It would be highly disturbing if it turns out to be true that its C2 system can indeed select and fire on wrong targets at will. Russian aircraft often buzz by Western warships and aircraft in the Baltic. If a missile is “unintentionally” fired during such a flyby, a war on Russia’s Western borders could become a reality. The actual cause of the Ka-52 incident is still unclear, and this has already had international ramifications. Belarus’s President Alyaksandr Lukashenka apparently refused to travel “to the north” to join Putin at the Luzsky firing range. The Belarusian leader told reporters, “What if a projectile hits us both [Putin and Lukashenka]?” On the last day of Zapad 2017, Lukashenka visited the troops together with reporters and foreign observers. Putin was absent; Shoigu had been expected but did not come, reportedly because of complications in Syria (Kommersant, September 21). On the last day of the war game, intense military activity was spread out to include the Barents Sea in the north and the Black Sea in the south, apparently mimicking an escalation of a conflict in the Baltic region into a major clash between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Though, the Russian military insists that any other military activity outside the official Zapad 2017 training areas was purely coincidental (see EDM, September 14). A ground-mobile RC-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was test-fired from the Plisetsk firing range, on September 20 (Militarynews.ru, September 20). Moreover, two supersonic Tu-22M3 Backfire jet bombers overflew the Baltic and Norwegian Seas (Militarynews.ru, September 21). These deployments would seem to indicate an escalation of the conflict with “Western forces,” as described in the Zapad 2017 scenario, going nuclear, but possibly in a limited fashion, to scare the West into submission and retreat—a potential deterrent tactic long embedded in Russian military thinking, though never announced publicly.

Vitaly Portnikov | Putin’s perfect trap for Ukraine -Euromaidan Press |
Why the Kremlin wants peacekeepers in the Donbas Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to actively seek support for his initiative to send UN peacekeepers to the Donbas zones of conflict. After his telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he had a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. Obviously, Putin’s efforts will continue, if only because of the attendance of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the UN General Assembly. Of course, it is easier to try to convince oneself that all these actions by Putin are just another maneuver designed to legitimize the presence of Russian troops and mercenaries in the Donbas. And that no decision on deploying peacekeeping forces will be taken because, at a critical moment, Putin will inevitably “insist” on something. And in the best case scenario, everything will remain as it is– with permanent shelling of our territory and sanctions against the invader. And in the worst case, Putin will launch another war just before elections in Russia. After all, it is not by accident that Russia has organized the Zapad-2017 military exercises right by our and Europe’s borders. In this situation, everything is absolutely clear. We have already become used to the current conditions, and war must be prevented, or if it begins, it must be won. Nevertheless, I propose that we consider a more likely development — that Putin really is preparing to “withdraw” from the Donbas. But he will do so in way that prevents the restoration of Ukrainian control over the occupied territory. So far, nobody is preparing for such a development in Ukraine, even though this could turn out to be the perfect trap for our country’s future. However, let us just try to imagine a likely development: a compromise is reached on the issue of peacekeepers. They are placed throughout the occupied territory, including that part of the border that is currently under Moscow’s control. Shooting stops. Russian troops and mercenaries leave the area. The “people’s republics” self liquidate, giving way to the interim administrations of the “separate districts.” Russia ends all aid to the Donbas, but, at the same time, the financial support of the region, including the payment of salaries, pensions, and infrastructure maintenance, falls on Ukraine. Does this mean that Ukrainian control has been restored? Not at all. I would like to point out that all the efforts to introduce the UN peacekeeping force, to protect the OSCE observers, and, in general, to ensure security are linked to the desire to begin implementing the Minsk agreements. Actually, this is what the leaders of the member countries of the Normandy format have been discussing during their consultations. This is precisely what Merkel and Macron are requesting, not only from Putin but also from Poroshenko. And the Ukrainian president quite rightly keeps responding that there can be no discussion about implementing the Minsk agreements as long as there are occupation forces and shelling in the Donbas. And then the occupying forces leave and there is no more shelling either. Of course, we can imagine that, at that moment, Ukraine could ignore any agreements and liberate the occupied territories — all the more so, if the occupier is gone. But this is an illusion. The residents of the “separate regions” will be under the protection of the UN peacekeepers. After all, their presence, no matter what we may think, will legitimize what is no longer an external but an internal conflict.
Poroshenko: deploying UN peacekeepers won’t happen on Russian scenario – 112.international
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko assured that the UN peacekeeping mission in Donbas will not be conducted under the Russian scenario. Poroshenko said this during a joint press conference with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, as the press service of Ukraine’s President informs. “I think we have a unique chance. Of course, it won’t be a Russian scenario. The UN peacekeeping mission must be deployed all over Donbas, including the Ukraine-Russia border to prevent the infiltration of Russian troops and weapons. Certainly, we will welcome the increase of the role of our partners in this issue,” Petro Poroshenko stressed. As it was reported earlier, Poroshenko is on a working visit to Canada. Poroshenko is to meet Canadian MPs and business representatives. He will also take part in the festive ceremony of opening the Invictus Games where the national Ukrainian team will participate for the first time.

Kurt Volker: Germany, France should remain leading participants in Minsk process – 23.09.2017 14:27 — Ukrinform News
Accession of the United States to the Normandy format is inexpedient. Germany and France should remain the key participants in the Minsk negotiation process. United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker said this in an interview with DT.UA news site. “It is important that Germany and France remain the leading participants in this process. This is convenient. Berlin and Paris use their capabilities within the framework of the Minsk process to discuss specific details: where the ceasefire line should lie; how, where and when heavy weapons should be withdrawn; how to counteract escalation in specific hot spots, etc. These are certainly important things. However, in my opinion, direct participation of the US would not add anything when dealing with these issues,” the diplomat said. In his view, the United States can play an important role in focusing the vision of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the strategic dimension of the problem he faced in Ukraine. “The US can tell Putin: if you want, we can help; if you do not want to, we can guarantee you will find yourself even in a worse situation,” Volker added. Earlier it was reported that the US Department of State explored the options for joining the Normandy format and negotiations on the implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to settle the situation in Ukraine.
UAWire – Russian Prime Minister Medvedev says U.S. intends to bury Nord Stream-2
The U.S. wants to bury the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline, as stated by Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference following a meeting with his Finnish counterpart Juha Sipila, Interfax reports. “The most pragmatic is the position of the United States, which wants to bury this project with all sorts of legal decisions, instruments, sanctions, having an ambiguous impact on the European Union,” said Medvedev. He noted that the European Commission’s position on Nord Stream-2 is also unacceptable for Russia. “As for the position of the European Commission, it is only being formulated, but it is probably not as pragmatic as the position of Finland, and it is intended to invite the Russian Federation to sign a separate agreement on Nord Stream-2. In our view, this is unacceptable from the point of view of equality towards all investors, since such projects were implemented outside all agreements on the basis of bilateral arrangements,” Medvedev said. In July, Germany rejected five projects for the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline due to “uncertainty.”

Window on Eurasia — New Series: A Peril for Putin: Bomb Scares in Russia Show No Sign of Letting Up, Officials Say
Paul Goble Staunton, September 22 – Over the last 12 days, 400,000 Russians have been evacuated from approximately 1,000 facilities in 80 cities after anonymous callers had warned that bombs were set to go off in them. Officials, who so far haven’t identified let alone arrested those responsible, say there are no signs the bomb scares are letting up (tass.ru/proisshestviya/4583551). The central government media have devoted relatively little attention to this wave, although a Duma committee is considering tougher penalties for what has now come to be known as “telephone terrorism” and the Kremlin has been forced today to say that it is too early to say anything about what is going on (fedpress.ru/news/77/policy/1861027). What makes this such a big and serious problem as the emergency services minister said (themoscowtimes.com/news/the-mass-evacuations-in-numbers-59017) is that the authorities have little choice but to evacuate buildings if they receive warnings and that whoever started the calls, others may join in a kind of copycat crime. Consequently, even if the authorities do identify one or another of the callers or those behind that individual or group, others are likely to make use of the same tactic, against which at least for the time being the Russian authorities appear powerless to stop, however much economic damage these evacuations may cause. But far more significant than any economic costs, of course, are the political ones. Vladimir Putin has sold himself to the Russian people as a guarantor of order, as someone who ended the “lawless 1990s.” If Russians conclude that he is no longer able to do that, they may conclude that their version of “the mandate of heaven” has passed from him. And that in turn suggests that some opponents of Putin and his regime may continue to make such calls, even if the risks of engaging in “telephone terrorism” are increased, as Russia edges closer to the presidential elections early next year and enters a new and more complicated political season.
Window on Eurasia — New Series: Has the Tatarstan President Finally Become ‘Putin’s Foot Soldier’?
Paul Goble Staunton, September 22 – Moscow has challenged Tatarstan in two serious ways in the past quarter: it has not extended the power-sharing agreement that Kazan saw as the basis of relations between Tatarstan and Russia, and it has insisted that the study of Russian be compulsory but that the study of non-Russian languages like Tatar completely voluntary. There have been numerous commentaries on both sides of these two controversies. But a speech on the state of the republic yesterday by President Rustam Minnikhanov provides the clearest indication yet of how Kazan plans to behave in the future, deferential to Moscow but perhaps not as subservient as the Kremlin would like. In a discussion of the speech, Natalya Goloburdova and Elena Chernobrovkina of Kazan’s Business-Gazeta suggest that the speech shows the Tatarstan president has become “Putin’s foot soldier.” But if that is so, it does not appear that he will be one who doesn’t question and challenge his commander (business-gazeta.ru/article/358312). Unlike in his earlier addresses where he spoke almost exclusively about economics, Minnikhanov this time focused on politics. He reminded his audience that there are growing risks in the world and that these “dictate the need for the all-possible strengthening of the Russian Federation as the common home of the many peoples of our country.” “We are integrated in Russian statehood over many centuries. There is a complete understanding that only a strong Russian can serve as a guarantor of the successful development of our republic and of all Tatars wherever they live.” But then he added “life itself constantly shows that strong regions made for a strong Russia.” Minnikhanov then focused on the two issues most riling Tatarstan now: the non-extension of the power-sharing agreement and preference for Russian language instruction at the possible expense of the requirement for study or at a minimum the reduction in the amount of non-Russian language instruction. As for the former, the Tatarstan president said: “For about a quarter of a century, the content of our relations with the federal center was defined by agreements on the delimitation of authority …. But in present-day conditions, the leading factor is not so much the form of relations of the republic and the federal center than their content.” In short, there is not going to be an extension of the power-sharing accord, and Kazan is not going to press Moscow on that issue, the two journalists say. But there are going to be fights about Kazan’s powers that may address many of the things that earlier power-sharing accords had defined. And as for the latter, Minnikhanov again straddled the issue. On the one hand, he said that “it is necessary to place the accent on security the level of knowledge and mastery of the Russian language,” but on the other, “there is a need to improve the methods of teaching Tatar as the state language of the Republic of Tatarstan.” Among the steps he mentioned with regard to Tatar was a call for the restoration of a national pedagogical institute, apparently an indication that Minnikhanov plans to have a Tatar language teacher training institute soon. Summing up, the two journalists say, “Minnikhanov really spoke as a politician” rather than as an economic functionary,” thus recapitulating the course that his predecessor Mintimir Shaymiyev did 30 years ago and becoming “a real politician” who can deal with other politicians including those in Moscow.
Window on Eurasia — New Series: Poklonskaya is the Nina Andreyeva of Today, Ikhlov Says
Paul Goble Staunton, September 22 – On March 13, 1988, a previously unknown chemistry teacher named Nina Andreyeva published in Sovetskaya Rossiya – or at least it was published over her name – an attack on Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika under the title “I cannot give up my principles.” Because of Gorbachev’s absence at that moment, it was distributed by the Soviet news agency and published in most newspapers in the USSR, an indication that it represented an important point of view supported by many in the Kremlin rather than simply the opinion of one chemistry instructor. Andreyeva’s article, Yevgeny Ikhlov notes in a commentary yesterday, called into question the efforts of Gorbachev and Aleksandr Yakovlev to make use of Lenin to push aside Stalin and thereby open the way for what they hoped would be a renewal of socialism (kasparov.ru/material.php?id=59C3DF31C982C). According to the Moscow commentator, “Andreyeva destroyed the ideological consensus around ‘the renewal of socialism’ in exactly the same way that the Kornilov attack destroyed the unity of the ‘February’ revolutionaries” in 1917. But it did far more than that, and its broader impact is why it is worth recalling now. “The split of the perestroika people gave the opportunity to radicals (crypto-anti-communists) legally to create their own extra-party social-political movements, ‘peoples fronts in defense of perestroika,’ in the first instance in the Baltic republics,” with all the follow on from that, Ikhlov says. Moreover, Andreyeva’s article provided the occasion for a Politburo declaration in Pravda on April 5, 1988, entitled “Principles of Perestroika: Revolutionary Thought and Actions,” that laid down more clearly than anything up to then exactly where Gorbachev and his team hoped to take the USSR. Today, Ikhlov continues, a similar situation has emerged. Duma Deputy Natalya Poklonskaya has called into question yet another “’perestroika’ but already a ‘monarchical’ one.” The Putin regime wants to promote a return to traditionalist values including many taken from the Russian monarchy. To that end, it has promoted articles, books, television programs, and films about various Russian leaders from the beginning through 1917. But to make a film about the last tsar which paints him in an entirely positive light is impossible not only because of the historical record but because he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks among whose heirs Putin sees himself. But “happily” someone recalled that there was the story of the romance between the future Nicholas II and the ballerina Mathilda Kshesinskaya, and someone decided that would make the perfect subject for a popular film that would offer the image of “monarchism with a human face.” What the present-day “’engineers of political souls’ did not expect” was how the Russian people would react to a portrayal of a tsar (or in this case future tsar) as a human being because in the very archaic world that the Putin regime has promoted, Russians want their rulers to be not human but more than human. As a result, yet another “clever plan of the rulers to stupefy the population” failed, and it failed because Poklonskaya spoke to what the popular masses wanted and believed rather than what the Kremlin hoped they would want and believe. The regime has thus put itself in a difficult position. What remains to be seen is whether it will lead to the formation of genuinely competing groups, as Andreyeva’s article did, and threaten those behind “Mathilda” as much as the Soviet chemistry teacher’s did those behind perestroika.
Window on Eurasia — New Series: Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian Nostalgia for USSR Based on Values Different than Their Leaders Might Prefer, Mirovich Says
Paul Goble Staunton, September 22 – Many Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians express nostalgia for Soviet times, but their reasons for doing so may not be exactly the same as the ones Vladimir Putin might wish for. Indeed, Belarusian blogger Maksim Mirovich says, some of them are very much at odds with what their leaders would like them to focus on. In a post yesterday, he lists what he calls five “basic arguments why people so much like the USSR and don’t like their present-day countries,” all based on the believe that they in fact “really live worse” now than in the Soviet past (maxim-nm.livejournal.com/357466.html; reposted atcharter97.org/ru/news/2017/9/22/263673/).
These are:
“The poor quality of today’s products,” especially foodstuffs.
“The sad situation with work in company towns.”
“Bad roads.”
“The loss of status of [formerly] ‘honored professions’” like teaching.
And “hatred for the rich.” The last is especially important.
In Soviet times, the communist authorities encouraged people to have a negative view of anyone with money; and many Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians have not adapted to the shift in values their leaders promote to the notion that gaining wealth is a positive thing. But what is striking about Mirovich’s list is less what is on it than what is not. Based on the comments of people to his blog posts, he finds little of the nostalgia for the past based on the idea that the Soviet Union was a great power, feared if not always respected by others, while Russia and even more her two Slavic neighbors are far less so. While the Belarusian blogger’s list is hardly conclusion, it is a useful reminder that not all nostalgia is for what Vladimir Putin or other leaders might like to see brought back and that some of what powers that positive view of the past involves values that may even threaten those in power now.

Russian Soldiers On Belarus: ‘Why Would It Be Bad If We Stayed Here?’ – Charter’97 :: News from Belarus – Belarusian News – Republic of Belarus – Minsk
Some of the Russian soldiers told they had spent a month in Belarus already. In Veraitsy, which is the junction station near Asipovichy, an echelon with the Russian armoured vehicles, involved in the West-2017 exercises, was formed. Five dozen carriers and tanks of various modifications moved on platforms towards Asipovichy. The armoured vehicles had been brought to the same station, and then it was moved to the Asipovichy firing ground, one of the six in Belarus where maneuvers took place. It is located less than five kilometers away from the Veraitsy station, Radio Liberty reports. It’s like at war: one shot, no house The locals tell, the military vehicles that should be transported to Russia, came from the firing ground in self-propelled mode the previous night. They have been loaded for more than twelve hours. “It was terrible in the house. The house shook with the roar of those vehicles. I thought, it would fall apart log by log.

Todd Wood | Is Russia losing its hold on Moldova? – Washington Times
Four years ago, 20 percent of the banking assets of the tiny, landlocked nation of Moldova simply disappeared. In Europe’s poorest country, this was a lot of money and a very big deal. The loss of the money to an intricate looting scheme angered ordinary Moldovans who marched in the streets and put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the pro-European Union government.

The United States still has no final decision on the issue of supply of protective weapons to Ukraine – US not yet decided to supply Ukraine with defensive weapons – 112.international
The United States still has no final decision on the issue of supply of protective weapons to Ukraine. The United States still has no final decision on the issue of supply of protective weapons to Ukraine. This is reported by Deutsche Welle, referring to the words of an unnamed representative of the White House. As the representative of the US presidential administration noted, the question of providing Ukraine with defensive weapons is still at the stage of elaboration, and no final decision has been taken on it. We recall, President Petro Poroshenko said that provision of defensive weapons to Ukraine by the United States will allow resolving the conflict in Donbas and will increase the cost of Russian aggression. According to Poroshenko, providing the Ukrainian armed forces with US defensive weapons, together with the sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Russia, will liberate the occupied territories. “The first myth is that American weapons will force Russia to send its weapons to Donbas, but Russia never stopped doing this, and secondly, American weapons will not solve the situation as a whole, but this will definitely help to resolve the situation along with sanctions and diplomatic pressure. American weapons will increase the tension, but this will increase the cost of Russian aggression. In the face of such a strong deterrence, Moscow should think twice before allowing a new offensive, “Poroshenko said during the speech. Earlier we reported that “the US Senate approved a draft law on the U.S. national security budget 2018, which provides for the allocation of 500 million dollars to support Ukraine in the security and defense spheres,” the head of state wrote. According to him, the draft law authorizes the provision of lethal arms of a defensive character to our state. It also includes provisions that allow U.S. defense budgets to be used to rehabilitate wounded Ukrainian servicemen in the United States medical facilities, and to strengthen the capabilities of our state’s air and naval forces.

Canada wants to lift restrictions on arms exports to Ukraine – Canadian PM Trudeau – 23.09.2017 11:58 — Ukrinform News
Canada is elaborating legislation to lift the current ban on arms exports to Ukraine. Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau said this after the talks with President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, an Ukrinform correspondent reports. “We are moving forward regarding the mechanism of the Automatic Firearms Country Control List,” Trudeau said. However, he stressed that Ukraine should meet a number of criteria to be put on this list. “There is a process which requires meeting a number of criteria, but we are working on it,” the Canadian Prime Minister said. At the same time, Trudeau did not mention specific dates when this process could end. The Automatic Firearms Country Control List defines the countries, which Canada allows its domestic producers to supply weapons to. Currently, there are 35 countries on the list, including Botswana, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Colombia. Ukraine is not on the list so far. In April 2017, Canadian National Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan stated that opening of the arms market would become the next step in the defense cooperation between Canada and Ukraine.

Hungary appeals in UN to investigate Ukrainian education law – 112.international
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Péter Szijjártó, during his speech at the 72nd United Nations General Assembly, said that the education law previously adopted in Ukraine violates the right to use the language of national minorities.

History’s Model General? Reflections on the Life and Times of Belisarius
In 1780, the great neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David completed one of his finest works. Entitled “Belisarius Begging for Alms,” the oil painting depicts an aging warrior, blinded with a hand outstretched, seated at the base of a colossal Roman monument. His feet are bare, his beard unkempt, and his armor draped in coarse rags, dull in sheen. A slender walking cane rests to his side, propped against a stone slab bearing the name of a famous former general — Belisario, or Belisarius. A beautiful woman, her face etched in concern, drops a few coins into an upturned helmet, and whispers words of consolation. Her husband, a man in the vigor of youth and full military regalia, is in shock, his arms raised and his mouth open. He has just realized that the stricken veteran is his former commander, the legendary Belisarius himself. Although his name is not as well known as it once was, Belisarius has long been considered one of history’s finest tacticians. Under the orders of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, the sixth century general reclaimed vast tracts of Western Roman territory, from northern Africa to the Italian peninsula. Frequently outnumbered and leading an eclectic grouping of warriors composed of romaioi (Eastern Romans), foederati (Barbarian allies), and ethnikoi (specialist ethnic troops), the Thracian commander greatly expanded the footprint of the Byzantine empire at a time when many thought that Rome’s ancestral lands had been irredeemably lost. The fact that many of these conquests, as we shall see, only proved fleeting, has, if anything, only burnished his myth, transmogrifying the soldier into something of a crepuscular icon — Western Europe’s last great Roman protector before the advent of the so-called Dark Ages.

WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort was looking for an investor, and Oleg Deripaska was his man. It was 2008, and a famed Manhattan building known as the Drake Hotel was being eyed by the American lobbyist and political adviser Manafort for purchase and development. On June 30, Manafort met with Deripaska, a Russian who had earned his fortune and reputation as a hard-knuckled, take-no-prisoners businessman in the 1990s consolidating control over Russia’s metals industry. According to a memo generated by Manafort’s then-partner Rick Gates to two Deripaska associates, the Russian billionaire was definitely interested in investing, telling Manafort “to lock the other financing elements and then come back to him for the final piece of investment.”

Oh, and there’s a Rosneft connection, you Putin conspiracy hounds. The RNC account in question has been historically used to pay for the RNC’s own legal bills, but just last month paid over $300,000 to help cover Trump’s personal legal expenses, Federal Election Commission filings reveal. Oh, and that same fund also paid about $200,000 to attorneys representing the President’s dumbest son, Don Jr.

With the Mueller Investigation Finished, Russiagaters are Scrambling
If there was ever any doubt that the Democrats take the black vote for granted, that doubt should have been put to rest when Barack Obama told the Congressional Black Caucus, "Stop whining!"
Have you ever before heard either a Democratic or a Republican leader tell his party's strongest supporters, "Stop whining"?
Blacks have a lot to complain about, not just about this Democratic administration but about many other Democratic administrations, national and local, over the years.
Unfortunately, black voters, like many other voters, often judge by rhetoric, rather than realities. When it comes to racial rhetoric, the Democrats outdo the Republicans by miles.
Even Ronald Reagan, the great communicator, had problems communicating with black voters, as I pointed out years ago in my book "A Personal Odyssey" (pages 274-278).
All this came back to me during a recent cleanup of my office, which turned up an old yellowed copy of the New York Times with the following front-page headline: "White-Black Disparity in Income Narrowed in 80's, Census Shows" (July 24, 1992).
How many people in the media have pointed out that the black-white income gap narrowed during the Reagan administration, just as it has widened during the Obama administration? For that matter, how many Republicans have pointed it out?
The Reagan administration did not have any special program to narrow the racial gap in incomes. The point is that the kinds of policies followed in the 1980s had that effect, just as the kinds of policies followed by the Obama administration had opposite effects. But just listening to rhetoric won't tell you that.

Over the years, some of the most devastating policies, in terms of their actual effects on black people, have come from liberal Democrats, from the local to the national level.
As far back as the Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression of the 1930s, liberal Democrats imposed policies that had counterproductive effects on blacks. None cost blacks more jobs than minimum wage laws.
In countries around the world, minimum wage laws have a track record of increasing unemployment, especially among the young, the less skilled and minorities. It has done the same in America.
One of the first acts of the Roosevelt administration was to pass the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, which included establishing minimum wages nationwide. It has been estimated that blacks lost 500,000 jobs as a result.
After that Act was declared unconstitutional, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set minimum wages. In the tobacco industry alone, two thousand black workers were replaced by machines, just as blacks had been replaced by machines in the textile industry after the previous minimum wage law.
Fortunately, the high inflation of the 1940s raised the wages of even unskilled labor above the level prescribed by the minimum wage law. The net result was that this law became virtually meaningless, until the minimum wage rate was raised in 1950.

Prosecutor Admits: We Know Smollett Lied, We Dropped His Felony Charges Anyway
Katie Pavlich
During the late 1940s, when the minimum wage law had essentially been repealed by inflation, 16- and 17-year-old blacks in 1948 had an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, slightly lower than that of whites the same ages and a fraction of what it would be in even the boom years after the minimum wage rate kept getting increased by liberal Democrats.
Urban Renewal was another big Democratic liberal idea. It destroyed mostly low-income minority neighborhoods and replaced them with upscale housing that the former residents could not afford. People by the hundreds of thousands were scattered to the winds, destroying community ties between families, neighbors and local institutions from churches to family doctors to businesses.
Even when liberal Democrats try specifically to help blacks, the results often backfire. The political crusade for "affordable housing" and minority home ownership drew many blacks into homes they could not afford. The net result was an especially high rate of foreclosure and, in the end, black home ownership rates lower than they were before the "affordable housing" crusade began.
Listening to political rhetoric often leads to opposite conclusions from those resulting from checking out hard facts -- and not just for blacks.

Pere Lachaise
Posted on August 11, 2013	by Paul
Yesterday was the Jewish calendar anniversary of our good friend Elli’s death. Her ashes are scattered on the gardens of Pere Lachaise so we decided it was a fitting place for us to remember her. We walked along the cobblestone lanes, climbed rough steps to the hills, and stopped at the gardens to remember the wonderful times we shared with Elli and JP, her smile, her sense of humor, and her incredible strength of character.

We framed our perambulations by seeking as many artists’ memorials as possible. This took us all over the cemetery. There were a couple we failed to find, but it was a lovely way to guide our way through magnificent place.

In the evening Jean cooked a delicious meal of her chipotle raspberry chicken breast and yam hash and we shared a quiet dinner with JP. A great end to a lovely day.

About Paul
I'm retired, but working at painting, photography, and song writing. We like to travel and paint plein air in new places. Of course that's also where photography comes into the picture, so to speak. Sometimes I get inspired to write songs about the people and places we visit.

Beautiful cemetery. We were there years ago. Lovely photos, Paul and Jean. The chipotle raspberry chicken breast and yam hash that followed sounds delicious!

This is a pretty interesting cemetery. You still missed a few painters. Do you know that when it was built at the initiative of the Baron Haussman under the 2nd Empire, its land came from two towns who found themselves annexed to Paris: half comes from the town of La Chapelle, and the other half comes from the town of Charonne. The cemetery is still active but has now long been filled, so there is no hope for newcomers to reside for eternity here; in order to be buried here, one has to wait for a concession to expire and even so I am sure that one needs a considerable amount of social connections. There rue de Charonne where Elli and I lived went from Paris to the town of Charonne. The towns were annexed in 1859.

Weekly Word: Driessen stops by to talk eco-imperialism and the evolution of environmentalism
Paul Driessen, author of “Eco-Imperialism” and a major voice on energy and environmental issues, joined Jason Spiess and The Word Merchant Stephen Heins on the Weekly Word.
Spiess began by mentioning “people in white lab coats” were promoting renewable energy. Driessen went on to comment about the fact CO2 was only .04 percent of the atmosphere; instead he thought that the more important issue was “energy density,” because it gave more bang for the buck. He also mentioned that the current government incentives for renewables weren’t a free market solution and that even The European Union had started walking away from their subsidies.
While financial institutions like CALPERS were making ideological investments in non-fossil fuels, Heins talked about the fiduciary responsibility and regulation for financial institutions, when they are investing other people’s capital. Driessen observed that several university endowment funds were anti-Fossil fuel prejudices, too.
Spiess discussed the importance of the Shale Revolution, with an emphasis on job creation and Heins added that capital formation through profitability was necessary for any investments in new technology and infrastructure.
They also discussed the inefficiencies of premature investments made by government dictate. Heins pointed out that China was already suffering from such dictates.
Driessen concluded with a powerful point: Developing nations should do what the wealthier countries did by following their ways of making money and investments. Heins went on to say that large-scale energy efficiency will continue to be the “quickest, cleanest, cheapest” form of new energy for all nations. He finished his comments by talking about the efficiencies of the Internet of Things and the industrial Internet.
Spiess finished the program by talking about the “religion of environmentalism” and its ideology, with Driessen returning to the importance of economic development and Heins reemphasized the primacy of return on investments.

Indonesia mourns as death toll from quake jumps to 832
September 30, 2018

Search and rescue workers evacuate an earthquake and tsunami survivor trapped in a collapsed restaurant, Palu, Central Sulawesi
The toll from an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia soared to 832 confirmed dead on Sunday, with authorities fearing the numbers will climb as rescuers grappled to get aid to outlying communities cut off from communications and help.
Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, on Sulawesi island, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday.
A woman was pulled alive from the debris of the city's Roa Roa Hotel, where up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the wrecked eight-storey Tatura Mall searching for loved ones.
"Grieve for the people of Central Sulawesi, we all grieve together," President Joko Widodo tweeted late on Sunday.
Most of the confirmed deaths were in Palu itself, and authorities are bracing for the toll to climb as connections with outlying areas are restored.
Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, which has been cut off from communications since Friday.
"We haven't received reports from the three other areas. Communication is still down, power is still out. We don't know for sure what is the impact," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a news conference.
Along with Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, these districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million.
Social worker Lian Gogali tweeted from the area that several villages on the west coast of Sulawesi were in desperate need of food, medicine and shelter and that road access was still limited.

PLEDGE TO REBUILD
Five foreigners - three French, one South Korean and one Malaysian - were among the missing, Nugroho said. The 832 dead included people crushed in the quake and swept away by the tsunami.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could rise into the thousands.
Earlier President Widodo visited a housing complex flattened when the quake liquefied the soil it stood on, and called for patience.
"I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications," he said. The ruins would be rebuilt, he said, as aftershocks rattled the region 48 hours after the quake.
Footage of the ruined city show a crumpled mess of houses, cars and trees mashed together by the quake, with rooftops and roads split and left at all angles.
Internal Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo, asked about reports of looting on social media, said he had ordered authorities to help people get food and drink and businesses would be compensated. One video posted on YouTube showed people grabbing boxes of supplies from a truck.
Television pictures showed scores of residents shouting "we're hungry, we need food" as soldiers distributed rations from a truck in one neighborhood, while footage from elsewhere showed people making off with clothes and other items from a wrecked mall.
State logistics agency chief Budi Waseso said it was preparing to send hundreds of tonnes of government rice stocks to Central Sulawesi areas affected by the disaster.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported.
QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS
Indonesia, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday. Nugroho, bemoaning a fall in funding, said no tsunami buoys, one type of instrument used to detect the waves, in Indonesia had been operating since 2012.
The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. But officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu's beach when the water surged. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph).
Video on social media showed water bearing whirls of debris rushing in as people shouted in alarm and scattered.
Palu is at the head of a bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had "amplified" the wave as it was funneled towards the city, a geophysics agency official said.
The BMKG said its closest tidal gauge sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an "insignificant" 6 cm (2.5 inches) wave.
Palu's airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said.
Neighbors including Australia, Thailand and China offered help and Pope Francis, speaking to thousands in St. Peter's Square, said he was praying for the victims.
Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but also significant pockets of Christians, including on Sulawesi, which is one of the archipelago nation's five main islands.

David Brooks on Technical Knowledge and Moral Wisdom

The popular New York Times columnist writes:
The best part of the rise of online education is that it forces us to ask: What is a university for? . . .
My own stab at an answer would be that universities are places where young people acquire two sorts of knowledge, what the philosopher Michael Oakeshott called technical knowledge and practical knowledge. Technical knowledge is the sort of knowledge you need to understand a task — the statistical knowledge you need to understand what market researchers do, the biological knowledge you need to grasp the basics of what nurses do.
Technical knowledge is like the recipes in a cookbook. It is formulas telling you roughly what is to be done. It is reducible to rules and directions. It’s the sort of knowledge that can be captured in lectures and bullet points and memorized by rote.
Brooks is citing Oakeshott, whom I haven’t read, so let me be clear here that I’m reacting here not to the original source but to the above characterization, “the statistical knowledge you need to understand what market researchers do,” etc.
In all seriousness, I think statistics and biology are like many other skills, such speaking a foreign language, playing a musical instrument, or hitting a softball: they are hard to learn, but if you put in the time you can be ok at it. To say that “memorizing by rote” is the way people learn statistics, biology, languages, music, or athletic skills—-that’s just stupid. There are some things you do need to memorize, but learning is about making connections and practice practice practice practice practice.
It’s hard for me to believe Brooks actually believes something so dumb. I think what happens is that he has a smooth writing style and the words just come out sounding right, and he never goes back to see if they make sense. When I write for the Times, an editor reads my articles and goes in and makes changes, but maybe Brooks is too much of a big shot for that or maybe his editor gives Brooks’s columns a non-literal read. I can see why it makes sense to give Brooks free rein with his prose, in that I was amused by this sentence of his: “Are universities mostly boot camps for adulthood, where young people learn how to drink moderately, fornicate meaningfully and hand things in on time?” That phrase “fornicate meaningfully” is just perfect.
One reason to suspect that Brooks does not believe that technical knowledge is “memorized by rote” is that he later writes that mooks are the solution: “as online education becomes more pervasive, universities can no longer primarily be in the business of transmitting technical knowledge. Online offerings from distant, star professors will just be too efficient.” But if you’re just memorizing, why the need for star professors? Anyone can read from a script and give you things to memorize.
Instead, Brooks wants universities to teach “the wisdom a great chef possesses that cannot be found in recipe books. Practical knowledge is not the sort of knowledge that can be taught and memorized; it can only be imparted and absorbed. It is not reducible to rules; it only exists in practice.” That’s fine too. Most of our students are not going to be great chefs or even great statisticians, but we’d like them to be the best they can be at what they do. But I don’t think they’re gonna get there if they think their technical knowledge is something to be memorized by rote.
P.S. Also, what’s with the slam on “bullet points”? Suppose I have four sentences to convey. In some contexts, they can work best in paragraph form, in other cases as a numbered list, in other cases as bullet points. I use all three, and I think Brooks is foolish to dismiss bullet points as a mode of communication. Just cos Dilbert’s boss gives bullet-ridden powerpoints, it doesn’t mean they’re always a bad idea.
P.P.S. This is a good place to link to a criticism by Jay Livingston of an earlier column where David Brooks tells just one side of the story (“Brooks’s tour did not include a stop to chat with Nechemaya Weberman. . . .”)
P.P.P.S. Please don’t take all this a criticism of Brooks. I recognize that he’s a busy man. He makes mistakes, but so do we all. To say that Brooks has written something stupid is not to say that he is stupid. I’ve written stupid things too. I just recommend that in the future he read his words more carefully, watching out for things that sound good but don’t make sense on closer inspection. I also recommend that he acknowledge the errors he’s published in the past. One reason for this is it will establish a personal incentive for him to be accurate. If he knows he will have to correct his errors and suffer the resulting (small) embarrassment, maybe he’ll be more motivated to avoid the errors in the first place.
P.P.P.P.S. I’ve added a paragraph above (“Brooks is citing Oakeshott, whom I haven’t read . . .”) to be clear that, when using the term “technical knowledge,” Brooks is referring to a particular meaning of the phrase. I still don’t think that “memorizing by rote” has anything much to do with understanding what market researchers do, etc., but I was mistaken in criticizing Brooks’s use of the term without making this clarification.

After gaining Environmental Protection Agency registration, Syngenta Force 6.5G will be available for the 2019 growing season. It’s a high-load granular corn insecticide that provides control of corn rootworm.
“We are launching Force 6.5G to meet the changing needs of growers, said Meade McDonald, product lead for insecticides at Syngenta in a recent press release. “This higher-load formulation goes farther and results in fewer stops to refill insecticide boxes, which allows faster, more efficient planning with less hassle.
Force 6.5G can be applied in a wide variety of “open” system granular application equipment and features a 50% lower dust-off rate when compared to Force 3G. It comes in a 20-acre bag.
“Force 6.5G will deliver the same superior root protection and maximize yield potential, when used on either conventional corn or CRW traits (single or double stack),” McDonald said.

Donald Trump during a debate. Photo: Screenshot.
Donald Trump swiftly reversed his statement that women should be punished for abortions after his initial comments unleashed a storm of criticism from both anti-abortion and pro-abortion rights groups.
“This issue is unclear and should be put back into the states for determination,” the Republican front-runner said in a written statement released by his campaign.

Environment
The Southwestern Research Station is located at around 5400 feet elevation in riparian habitat, surrounded by oak-juniper-pinyon pine woodlands. Within a short drive up or down the Chiricahua Mountains, which reach nearly 9800 feet elevation, five life-zones can be encountered: Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian. Bio-geographically, the Chiricahua Mountains are located at a crossroads between distinct desert and mountain biotas. At lower elevations, species are influenced by both the Sonoran Desert to the west and the Chihuahuan Desert to the south and east. At higher elevations, there is a mixing of plants and animals from the Rocky Mountains, to the north and the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains of Mexico. The uniqueness and diversity of the biota is well recognized by ornithologists, herpetologists, and entomologists. Cave Creek Canyon is also recognized as one of the top birding localities in the United States.

Directions
From Interstate 10, exit at Road Forks, New Mexico (Exit No. 5; Hwy 80). Take Hwy 80 south approximately 30 miles to route 533 (if you reach Rodeo, New Mexico, you’ve gone too far and must backtrack 2 miles). Turn right (west) on route 533 and go approximately 7 miles to Portal, Arizona. You’ll know you’re in Portal when you see Portal Peak Lodge on your left. Continue up the mountain, staying on pavement, another five miles (DO NOT take the right fork to Paradise). You’ll see an in ground pool on your left, followed by an expanse of grass and a cluster of buildings. Immediately after those buildings, you will turn left and cross over a wash. Immediately after crossing the wash, make another left through the gates and onto our grounds. Park in the main parking lot and walk down the dirt road to the first two-story building on your right. The office is downstairs. If you get lost, please call us at 520-558-2396. Remember there is no cell phone service near the SWRS. You can also stop at the Portal Peak Lodge and Store and ask for directions. They will be happy to guide you in the right direction to the station.

Arsenic
What is arsenic?
What are some of the specific concerns about arsenic? "
What are some of the health issues associated with arsenic?
What is arsenic?
Arsenic is a naturally occurring substance in groundwater. Arsenic can occur both naturally (organic arsenic) or as a byproduct of business and industry (inorganic arsenic). Organic arsenic can be found in water, air, soil, volcanic rock, plants and animals. The inorganic form of arsenic is used to preserve wood; create, mine or treat metals; and is also added to some paints, dyes and soaps. Arsenic is known to cause health problems.
There is a new Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard for arsenic, a naturally occurring substance in groundwater. The EPA recently tightened the maximum contaminant level standard from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to only 10 ppb.
What are some of the specific concerns about arsenic?
Arsenic is especially prevalent in the Western states and makes its way into the water supply as water percolates down through rock and soil. When groundwater is the primary source of water for a community - as is the case for many small water companies in rural areas - complying with the lower standard will require new, and sometimes costly, treatment methods.
The EPA estimates that approximately 13 million Americans are served by water systems that do not comply with the reduced standard. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) estimates that nearly one third of Arizona's water systems subject to the regulation do not meet the new, tighter standard. ADEQ regulates water quality for all water companies in Arizona.
The Arizona Corporation Commission has other regulatory and ratemaking authority for some of the water companies overseen by ADEQ. The Commission requires companies to be in compliance with ADEQ standards.
It is important to note that the arsenic standard was initiated by the EPA and will be enforced by ADEQ. The Commission will be involved only to the extent that the water companies it regulates will be required to comply. Some of these companies may come to the Commission to seek approval for rate adjustments, depending upon the costs they incur to comply with the tighter standard.
What are some of the health issues associated with arsenic?
Information provided by the EPA states that the new rule addresses the long-term, chronic effects of exposure to low concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. A fact sheet on the EPA website states that studies have shown that the ingestion of arsenic can cause adverse health effects, including:
Cancerous Effects: skin, bladder, lung, kidney, nasal passages, liver and prostate cancer; and Non-cancerous effects: cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, neurological and endocrine (e.g., diabetes) effects. Source: www.epa.gov/safewater/ars
How can I learn more?
For more information from the EPA, go to the safe drinking water section of the EPA's internet site: www.epa.gov/safewater. You may also contact Arizona's Department of Environmental Quality. For wastewater issues call 602-771-4614, for drinking water issues call 602-771-4651, or visit their website at www.adeq.state.az.us/environ/water/.

We Take the Confusion Out Of Applying For Adjustment Of Status
If you came to the U.S. as a nonimmigrant, for example, on a student or work visa, or as a refugee or asylee, you can change your status to immigrant and become a permanent resident. However, doing so requires an adjustment of status.
Adjustment of status is a process available to people who are already in the U.S. People who are not in the U.S. must go through the U.S. consular office. This eliminates the need to leave the U.S., return to your native country and re-enter as an immigrant.
At the Harrington Law Offices, in Boston, Massachusetts, we will help you adjust your status so you can obtain a green card and stay permanently in the U.S.
Understanding The Process
The process can be confusing and overwhelming. At Harrington Law Offices, attorney Daniel P. Harrington will work closely with you to make the process easier.
First, we will determine which immigrant category you fit into — employee, family member of a U.S. citizen, refugee or asylee — and prepare and file the necessary petitions. We will also help you obtain an immigrant visa.
Then, we will help you apply for permanent residency. At this point, you will be fingerprinted and have your photo taken, and a background check will be performed. If an interview is scheduled, we will prepare you for it and gather all necessary documentation.
We know you have many questions, and we will take the time to give you answers and explain the process, and your immigration options, to you.
Get Help With Adjustment Of Status. Call Us at 617-482-3800.
Adjusting your status is the first step toward becoming a permanent resident and eventually a citizen. For help navigating the process, call 617-482-3800 or contact us by email to schedule a low-cost consultation. Se habla español. Se Fala Português.

After TalkTalk, British businesses beg police for help from 'constant' hacking
Reuters and Rob Price
Oct. 24, 2015, 8:03 AM
Brian Snyder/Reuters
British business leaders are begging police to make cyber crime an urgent priority following a massive attack on broadband provider TalkTalk, saying firms face continual security breaches.
TalkTalk said the private data of its more than 4 million customers could be at risk following an intrusion by as-yet-unidentified hackers.
The data is believed to include names, addresses, emails, credit cards and banking details, and if the theft is confirmed by a police investigation it would be one of the country's largest online breaches.
TalkTalk has received a ransom demand via email — but it's not clear whether this was sent by the actual attacker. CEO Dido Harding admits that the company don't know if the email is legitimate, and it seems plausible that an unconnected opportunist could email her in an attempt to extort money.
The Institute of Directors, a British business lobby, said that while the biggest attacks gain most attention, companies face a constant threat from cyber security incidents.
"Only the most serious breaches make it into the headlines, but there are attacks on UK companies happening constantly," a spokesman said in a statement.
"The police must make this issue an urgent priority and investigate theft of data just as it would theft of physical property."
The attack of TalkTalk is the third one targeting the British telecoms company this year. The company has also admitted that not all customer data was encrypted, raising questions about whether adequate security measures were in place before the attack.
The hack follows dozens of high-profile cases targeting retailers and banks in North America.

Google I/O: Android TV, smart cars, wearables, and more
Updated on: June 25, 2014 / 1:43 PM / CBS/AP
An Android update, "the ultimate smart TV," wearable gadgets and so-called smart home devices are just some of the innovations Google showed off today as its two-day developers conference, known as Google I/O (for Input/Output), got underway in San Francisco.
In recent years, the conference has focused on smartphones and tablets, but this year Google's Android operating system is expected to stretch into cars, homes and smartwatches.
The head of Google's Android division, Sundar Pichai, took the stage first to talk about the growing reach of Android phones and tablets. He said Android now has one billion users, who take 93 million selfies, walk 1.5 trillion steps, and check their phones 100 billion times each day. Android app installations rose 236 percent over last year, he said.
Dave Burke, director of engineering for Android, described highlights of Google's latest Android operating system update, referred to as "L."

One new security feature called personal unlocking will allow a device to automatically unlock when its owner picks it up, by recognizing a familiar Bluetooth signal and other clues. If a stranger picks it up, it will stay locked.
It will have a battery saving feature that Burke says can extend battery life by 90 minutes, and 3D graphics capability for an immersive gaming experience.
Then came the much-anticipated announcement of Android's expansion into wearables. Google engineering director David Singleton introduced Android Wear, the software that will run smartwatches like the LG G and the Samsung Gear, which go on sale starting today on the Google Play store. Another model, the Moto 360, will be coming from Motorola later this summer.
Android Wear will enable developers to offer health tracking, navigation apps, voice-activated ride sharing requests, step-by-step cooking instructions and other functions in an even more portable format.
The company also announced Android Auto, which will bring many popular features of smartphones to new car models from more than 40 automakers beginning later this year. It will feature contextually aware navigation, streaming music and communications functions in an easy-to-use interface. CNET has more on how Android Auto will work.
Not satisfied with infiltrating cars, watches, phones and tablets, Google also made a play for the TV market, introducing Android TV. It will play streaming movies, television shows and games from any device and "cast" them onto your big screen. CNET's Tim Stevens' first reaction, as he live-blogged the announcement: "The power of Google search, plus Google voice recognition, on your TV, driven by your phone. The ultimate smart TV?"
Android TV will be available in the fall.
Apple announces new products, software updates
Google's I/O event comes at a time of transition for the company, which makes most of its money from advertising thanks to its status as the world's leader in online search. The company is trying to adjust to an ongoing shift to smartphones and tablet computers from desktop and laptop PCs. Though mobile advertising is growing rapidly, advertising aimed at PC users still generates more money.
At the same time, Google is angling to stay at the forefront of innovation by taking gambles on new, sometimes unproven technologies that take years to pay off -- if at all. Driverless cars, Google Glass, smartwatches and thinking thermostats are just some of its more far-off bets.
On the home front, Google's Nest Labs -- which makes network-connected thermostats and smoke detectors --announced earlier this week that it has created a program that allows outside developers, from tiny startups to large companies such as Whirlpool and Mercedes-Benz, to fashion software and "new experiences" for its products.
Integration with Mercedes-Benz, for example, might mean that a car can notify a Nest thermostat when it's getting close to home, so the device can have the home's temperature adjusted to the driver's liking before he or she arrives.
Nest's founder, Tony Fadell, is an Apple veteran who helped design the iPod and the iPhone. Google bought the company earlier this year for $3.2 billion.
Google Glass sparks altercation at San Francisco bar
Opening the Nest platform to outside developers will allow Google to move into the emerging market for connected, smart home devices. Experts expect that this so-called "Internet of Things" phenomenon will change the way people use technology in much the same way that smartphones have changed life since the introduction of Apple's iPhone seven years ago.
Google may also have news about Glass, including when the company might launch a new and perhaps less expensive version of the $1,500 Internet-connected eyewear. Google will likely have to lower the price if it wants Glass to reach a broader audience. But that's just one hurdle. Convincing people that the gadget useful, rather than creepy, is another one.

The United States Presidential Seal
The President of the United States is the head of the U.S. Executive Branch. As the head of state of the United States of America, the president is one of the most powerful people in the world. The writers of the Constitution recognized that they were writing a job description which, in England, was and is filled by the office of the prime minister and position of the monarch. According to the Founding Fathers of the USA, at that time, the monarchy of England did not appear to serve the common man and the Founding Fathers wanted a government that did.

Current president
Donald J. Trump currently is the 45th and current President. He took office on January 20, 2017. His legitimate predecessor was George W. Bush (see note below the Presidents list regarding Barack Hussein Obama).
Election
The president is selected every four years by the American people, although not through a popular vote but rather through the Electoral College. This process makes the presidency one of the few elected officials in the United States of America chosen indirectly. The Founding Fathers implemented this procedure to ensure the relevance of smaller states in the voting process.
Term limits
Prior to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, presidents voluntarily limited themselves to two terms as an homage to George Washington. After Franklin D. Roosevelt served a little over twelve years in office, Congress passed the 22nd Constitutional Amendment restricting future presidents to two terms.
However, if the vice president succeeds to the presidency with no more than two years left in the prior president's term, he is allowed to run for two full terms, raising the potential time in office to ten years.
The first president to whom term limits applied was Dwight D. Eisenhower.

1 There is doubt as to the legitimacy and legality of Obama's claim to the Presidency due to his refusal to disclose his legitimate birth records (the fraudulent "birth certificate" he released notwithstanding) and his history prior to his announcing his plan to run for President as a Democrat candidate in 2007. He has determined to keep his records sealed because revelation of such would reveal that, under Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, he was not only not eligible to hold the office of President but was ineligible to even run for the Presidency, thereby making both his Presidential run and his subsequent assumption of the office illegal under the Constitution. As such, Obama's ineligibility to run for or hold the office of President would mean that the United States of America did not have a legitimate executive from January 20, 2009 (the day that Obama assumed the office[1]) until January 20, 2017 (the day President Donald Trump was sworn in to possibly become the first legitimate President since George W. Bush).

Beaumont begins to build out 30 urgent care center network with outpatient facility at Woodward Corners shopping center on Royal Oak campus

One of the 30 urgent care centers planned by Southfield-based Beaumont Health over the next year will be located at Woodward Corners, the multi-use shopping center under construction at the corner of Woodward Avenue and 13 Mile Road in Royal Oak.
Beaumont officials earlier this month announced tenants at Woodward Corners, the former Northwood Shopping Center, that includes Beaumont Urgent Care, Meijer, Wahlburgers and New Order Coffee Roasters. The Royal Oak urgent care center, which will open in July, will be slightly larger than the average 5,000-square-foot centers under development, said COO Carolyn Wilson.
At least six Beaumont urgent-care centers will open this year, including locations in Troy (spring), Allen Park (spring). Farmington Hills (fall), Grosse Pointe Farms (summer) and Livonia (winter). Beaumont currently operates only one full-service urgent care center, in West Bloomfield Township.
But why put an urgent care at Woodward Corners, itself a 117,000-square-foot shopping outlet, right next to 1,100-bed Beaumont Hospital?
"It's about (ease of care and) community access to Beaumont Health. Woodward Corners is retail and a very busy corner. There will be a lot of people (coming) to enjoy the restaurant and shopping. It made a lot of sense to us" to locate an urgent care there, Wilson said.
The overall Beaumont campus, which covers about 16 acres, is nearly a small city with 10,000 to 13,000 people working, visiting or receiving treatment there at any one time.
"We will be locating the urgent cares close to (hospital) emergency departments. It is a lower-cost option for people with minor illnesses and reduces their total cost of care," said Wilson, adding that the eight-hospital Beaumont system has 600,000 annual ER visits, including 100,000 on the Royal Oak campus.
Last August, Beaumont Health signed an agreement with Atlanta-based WellStreet Urgent Care to finance and open 30 urgent care centers in metro Detroit. WellStreet will be the managing partner, but the centers will be backed by the Beaumont brand and staffed by a mix of Beaumont employees and new hires, Wilson said.
Several other health systems in Southeast Michigan are also investing in ambulatory and urgent care centers, including Henry Ford Health System, Detroit Medical Center and Ascension Health Michigan. The reasons are multifold. Patients, employers and insurance companies are demanding lower costs and more convenient locations. The centers also will be connected to Beaumont doctors and facilities through its Epic electronic health record system to improve care coordination.
Under the plan, Beaumont and WellStreet will jointly finance the centers, possible leases and property purchases on a 50-50 basis. Each center will vary in size and services, but the average center will cost about $1 million and attract an average of 30 patients per day after three years of operation, Beaumont said
At Woodward Corners, Wilson said the Royal Oak urgent center will be staffed by about 25 employees, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, medical assistants, pharmacists and other office staff. Hours haven't been finalized, but the center will probably open at 7 a.m. and close between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Basic lab tests and film X-rays will be on site, with other diagnostic tests performed at the hospital, she said.
To oversee the urgent care center operations, WellStreet and Beaumont have named Bernice Sessa, M.D., an emergency physician at Beaumont Hospital Troy, as regional medical director, and Jim Ray as regional vice president.
Several of the urgent care centers will be new facilities and some will be acquired by existing providers, Wilson said. "We are hoping to announce soon some acquisitions in targeted areas that we will fold into the joint venture," she said.
Beaumont currently operates an after-hours clinic for adults and pediatric patients at a medical office building near the north parking lot. Wilson said no decision has been made on closing that facility, designed for patients who don't have a primary care doctor. "We will be talking with the doctors about what they want," she said.
Another construction project underway at the Royal Oak campus is a 14,000-square-foot cardiovascular center for patients with heart failure. The $9 million Max & Debra Ernst Health Center, which the Ernsts' donated $5 million toward, is being built next to the east tower entrance of the hospital "We wanted to bring patients with heart failure together with doctors and diagnostics a little closer to parking to reduce their walk," she said.
Beaumont moving ahead on outpatient orthopedic strategy
The planned joint venture with Southfield-based Michigan Orthopedic Surgeons on a new orthopedic surgery and musculoskeletal center on the Royal Oak campus is moving ahead, albeit slowly. MOS, a 44-physician group practice composed primarily of Beaumont medical staff members, performs the bulk of inpatient surgeries at Beaumont hospitals, but does most of its outpatient surgeries at UnaSource Surgery Center in Troy.
Dennis Viellieu, CEO of Michigan Orthopaedic Surgeons PLLC, said the surgery center project is moving forward and he hopes contracts can be signed in about 60 days. He said the two health organizations are discussing details that will be included in a certificate-of-need application to the state later this year.
"We are now are looking at six months of planning the project, the building and the interior, to be followed by 18 months of construction," Viellieu said.
Wilson confirmed the surgery center planning is taking longer than she would like, but said there is a great need to develop an ambulatory surgery center at the Royal Oak campus to lower costs for patients and employers.
Beaumont recently completed construction of a $5.5 million, 10,000-square-foot outpatient orthopedic center on the campus of Beaumont Hospital in Taylor. Services in the 12-room facility include examinations, imaging, access to specialists, and treatment plans for injuries. Patients will continue to receive surgery in the hospital's operating rooms.
Wilson said the Taylor and Royal Oak surgery centers are part of a Beaumont strategy to move more into the outpatient arena to capture more patients and managed-care and employer contracts, and make care more convenient. She said Beaumont has secured managed-care contracts with the major payers for the centers.
"Taylor and Royal Oak makes sense. ... Separating inpatient and outpatient makes sense," Wilson said.
The two ambulatory centers will also include Beaumont orthopedic residents and fellows.
One of Michigan's largest health systems, Beaumont Health has total net revenue of $4.5 billion and includes eight hospitals with 3,429 beds, 187 outpatient sites, nearly 5,000 physicians, 38,000 employees and 3,500 volunteers.

Ansonia and School Board settle their suits

ANSONIA — The nearly year-long battle between the city and the Board of Education over money is nearly over.
After three marathon executive sessions this month, the Board of Aldermen Tuesday night finally approved a mediated settlement that will provide $850,000 to the Board of Education’s 2018-19 budget, bringing it to $32,110,484.
As part of the stipulation, that initial $850,000 will be whittled down to $800,000 as the minimum budget requirement for the 2019-2020 school board budget.
“All we need now is for the Ansonia Federation of Teachers to sign off on it, “ said William Nimons, chairman of the Board of Education, whose group again approved the settlement terms during an hour-long meeting Wednesday afternoon. “Then it will be all over.”
Matt Hough, the teacher’s union president, told Hearst Connecticut Media late Wednesday that approval should be coming “in the next few days.”
“We would have liked the settlement to require rehiring teachers we lost because of the budget cuts, but it does nothing for that,” he said. “It doesn’t help us rebuild what we lost.”
Instead, he said, the additional money will keep everything in line with “costs that keep increasing every year...salaries, insurance.”
Nimons said he believes that once a judge approves the settlement, the state Board of Education will end its investigation of the city for violating state law by removing money in January 2018 from a budget they already approved.
The Aldermen approved putting $600,000 into the 2017-18 budget ,claiming that was a loan given to the school board to help while it waited for the state to determine how much education funding the city would get.
When the school board got $1.8 million more than the district projected but less than it asked for, the Aldermen took back the $600,000.
Both the school board and the state Board of Education said the withdrawal violated the state’s Minimum Budget Requirement law. The school board sued the city; the state Board began an investigation.
The parties now have three days to get a Superior Court judge’s approval for the settlement.
Once that happens, the city has 15 days to appropriate the $850,000. Three days after that happens, the Board of Education and the Federation of Teachers will inform the state Board of Education that the minimum budget requirement has been met and request the state investigation end, according to the settlement.
Dismissal or resolution remains solely within the discretion of the Connecticut State Board of Education, the seven-page agreement reads.
“Hopefully, all this will be put behind us,” Hough said. “We can start working together and stop blaming each other.”
In exchange for the money, the school board must allow the city’s health insurance broker to get and analyze healthcare claims filed in the past year.
That’s been a sticking point for at least two years. It became a hot issue this year when an independent auditor determined the Board of Education overspent its 2017-18 budget by $225,694 mostly because it under-estimated insurance costs.
The 2017-18 school year marked the first year the Board of Education was self-insured.
The school board must also provide the city with five years of line item budgets, budget adjustment and transfers, adjustment journal entry transactions, a list of federal, state and miscellaneous grants and their dollar amounts and special education budgets. They also have to disclose the number of special education students who services.
“Finally, it looks like the first time in eight years we will have Board of Education transparency,” said Charles Stowe, a first ward alderman.
“We’ll be able to look back five years and see how money is being spent and on what,” added Corporation Counsel John P. Marini. “This will help us determine if money is being spent in the best interests of our students and if we are maximizing our dollars.”
Additionally, the city and the school board, which currently use separate financial software programs, must agree and select a replacement system by Sept. 30, 2019, that both will use and transition to by June 30, 2020.
Under the terms of the settlement, there is no admission of wrongdoing and no legal fees will be paid to either side.

10 Questions to Ask Before Engaging an Elder Law Attorney
Before you engage a Connecticut elder law attorney to help you, here are ten questions to help you determine whether or not an attorney is qualified to help you and your family with long term care issues and Medicaid planning.
Ideally, all the questions should be answered “yes.”
Are there at least 2 attorneys in the law firm who focus on long term care/Medicaid planning?
Have attorneys in the firm been engaged in long term care planning for at least 10 years?
Are attorneys in the firm members of the Elder Law Section of the Connecticut Attorney’s Bar Association?
Are attorneys in the firm members of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA)?
Are attorneys in the firm either Certified Estate Planning Law Specialists or Certified Elder Law Attorneys (CELA)?
Does the firm handle at least five Medicaid planning cases per month?
Have attorneys in the firm completed Medicaid applications?
Is there a CPA in the firm who can fully understand the income, gift and estate tax implications of long-term care and Medicaid planning?
Do the attorneys in the firm regularly attend seminars on long term care issues?
Will there be a back-up paralegal that is familiar with Medicaid/long-term care planning and will be familiar with your situation in case the attorney is not immediately available?
With the exorbitant costs of home care and nursing home care, particularly in Connecticut, planning ahead could have a significant impact on your family’s financial future. Be sure to engage a qualified elder law attorney. And by the way, all of our answers to the questions above are YES!

Tumblr is back on the iOS App Store as NSFW content ban looms

BTW
Tumblr users can now redownload the microblogging platform’s iOS app, mere days before Tumblr is set to ban all NSFW content from the site.
On Wednesday evening, Tumblr announced its iOS app was “back in the App Store and available for download” with the Version 12.2 update. This update features a “smoother experience and the latest and most up-to-date features” along with the Community Guidelines changes that “prohibit” adult content on the site. Pornographic content will be banned from Tumblr starting Dec. 17.
Since Tumblr’s return to the iOS store, users have given the app one-star reviews, largely criticizing the NSFW ban.
“The ban on the 17th is unacceptable,” one user wrote on Thursday. “If I could give it 0 stars for not listening to its user base, leaving truly horrible things like white supremacy blogs on while tearing down anyone who posts 50 pixels of flesh toned color, and generally being an incompetent site I would. I’ll consider changing my review if the ban is lifted.”
Apple
Tumblr was originally removed from the app store amid child pornography appearing on the site. One former staff engineer suggested the adult content ban “was going to happen anyway,” but Tumblr’s parent company Verizon “pushed it out the door after the child pornography thing,” according to Vox.
That engineer suggested the ban was “in the works for about six months” and was primarily planned because Verizon struggled to sell ads on a site with pornography.

‘Walking Dead’ finale marked by huge Daryl reveal and more heartbreak
Michelle Jaworski—
2014-12-01 04:32 pm | Last updated 2015-12-11 01:13 pm
One of the looming questions of The Walking Dead isn’t about the plot.
Warning: This post contains spoilers for The Walking Dead season 5 midseason finale.
The midseason finale of The Walking Dead was devastating for everyone, but Maggie Greene and Daryl Dixon may have gotten the worst of it. For one, Maggie—having already lost her father at the hands of the Governor last season—has now lost her last living relative. And Daryl lost a close friend and companion—and maybe something more?
Daryl’s sexuality has been something debated in The Walking Dead fandom for ages, and it’s something creator Robert Kirkman has finally confirmed on Sunday’s The Talking Dead, an after-show in which Chris Hardwick discusses what happened on the The Walking Dead episode everyone just watched.
In short, Daryl is straight. We’ve included some of Kirkman’s thoughts on the matter below since the clip’s audio is hard to hear unless the volume’s turned up all the way.
Daryl Dixon is being somewhat asexual on the show. I think that he’s a very introverted character and I think that’s somewhat his appeal. I do have to clear something up, though. In The Walking Dead letters column in the old comic book that I do, there was a question that made me mention that there was a possibility early on about making Daryl Dixon’s character gay and it caused quite a hubbub online. I just wanted to make it clear that I was saying that the possibility is there and I would’ve been fine with it, the network would have been fine with it, but we ultimately didn’t do that. I can make it official, Daryl Dixon is actually straight, but coming back in our next half of the season we’re going to be introducing a very prominent gay character from the comics that’ll be debuting.
The gay character from the comics in question is largely speculated by fans to be Aaron, a character who’s a recruiter from the Alexandria Safe-Zone—which, from the looks of the trailer, the group seems to be heading toward. He ends up being an ally to Rick and company.
Some fans may ultimately be disappointed that Daryl, a character created solely for the show, isn’t gay, but for the asexual community, which often gets misrepresented, marginalized, or is misunderstood, having Daryl in their corner is huge.
Although it’s possible for a person to have an orientation (such as straight) and still be asexual, we won’t know if Daryl is fully asexual until we see how his orientation is handled in future seasons. The asexual community, however, is hopeful.

REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT THANK YOU ROBERT KIRKMAN I LOVE YOU
— kylo savage ⭐️ (@philipbIake) December 1, 2014
“[T]he ace community gets so little representation – i for one have never seen an asexual character on tv ever – and this is quite possibly one of the biggest things to happen in the history of ace representation,” acecarol wrote on Tumblr. “please, even if you don’t watch the walking dead, even if you’re not on the ace spectrum, talk about this. please celebrate this with us.”
While some of The Walking Dead fandom is in celebration about Daryl’s possible asexuality, others are in complete disarray after the show abruptly killed off Beth Greene in the final minutes “Coda.”
That sunk Beryl, which paired Daryl and Beth together, who was more of a background character until the show placed her and Daryl together in the wilderness in “Still.” Although Daryl and Beth soon became separated, the show took to evolving Beth’s character until she was shot in the head by Dawn Lerner.

However, fans aren’t happy about Beth’s demise—and not just because Beryl is no more. Some of them are crying foul at Beth dying for nothing more than “simple fucking shock.” It’s not quite a literal “women in refrigerators,” but it feels just as ultimately pointless for an emerging character—and with Daryl’s reaction to retaliate by shooting Dawn, there’s even the man pain.
“Someone give me a comic on all the ladies who died to further ‘man pain’ just sitting around talking about it and then here comes Beth all pissed or something,” repyourclique wrote.

“[B]eth greene deserved better than this,” tommybishops wrote.
Even Emily Kinney, who played Beth since the show’s second season, didn’t really understand why Beth had to die when she did, and thought she had more story to tell.
“I think the Beth character, in particular… more could’ve been done with a teenager growing up [in that world],” she told TVLine. “I did not see it coming at all, especially this season. It’s weird, because I would’ve been OK with [this happening] in the second season or the third season, when I was like, “Oh, maybe this character is coming to a close. What else is there to do with her?” But now I feel differently… I feel like there was still so much more to [explore.], like, what could have happened with Daryl?”
With a mysterious teaser and February premiere, fans have a few months to process these events and grieve before they likely have their collective hearts stomped on with the next character death.

Sen. John Kerry won the New Hampshire primary last night capturing 39% of the vote with Howard Dean coming in second with 26%. Gen. Wesley Clark edged by Sen. John Edwards, both with 12%, for third place and Sen. Joseph Lieberman came in fifth with 9%. Rep. Dennis Kucinich had 2% of the vote and Al Sharpton, who skipped New Hampshire, came in last with less than 1%.
Senator John Kerry easily won New Hampshire’s primary yesterday, scoring a second-straight victory one week after winning the Iowa caucuses and establishing himself as the Democratic Party’s presidential front-runner.
With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Kerry had 39 percent of the vote, followed by Howard Dean with 26.
Gen. Wesley Clark and Senator John Edwards battled for third place with 12 percent each, but it looks like Clark just edged ahead for third.
Although Senator Joe Lieberman came in fifth with 9 percent of the vote he painted the outcome as a “three-way split decision” for third and rejected advice from some advisers to abandon his bid. Rep. Dennis Kucinich had 2 percent of the vote and Al Sharpton, who skipped New Hampshire to focus on South Carolina, came in last with less than 1 percent.
The New York Times calls Dean’s second place finish a “significant setback.” Dean was seen as the clear frontrunner in New Hampshire less than two weeks ago. It was also a disappointing day for Clark and Lieberman, who skipped the Iowa caucuses to focus on New Hampshire.
The campaign now moves south for the Feb. 3 primaries, which will take place in seven states from Delaware to Arizona, from South Carolina to North Dakota.
President Bush who won comfortably in the Republican primary against no serious opposition has scheduled a visit to New Hampshire tomorrow. Bush used a similar tactic last week when he scheduled his State of the Union Address one day after the Iowa caucuses.
According to the Washington Post, Kerry demonstrated across-the-board support from voters winning among both men and women, among all ages except the very youngest, and among the richest and poorest and every income group in between.
Kerry easily won among voters with a college degree and even more handily among those with a high school education. Voters with postgraduate degrees favored Dean.
The Post reports that among ideological groups, Dean did best only among voters who described themselves as “very liberal,” while Kerry carried moderates, liberals and conservatives.

Everyone has their ideas on how to lose weight. Here’s how to separate fact from fiction
Last week, Rob Baban, owner of Game 7 Fitness (http://www.g7fit.com) in Moorestown, NJ, offered us five tips on weight loss. This week, he returns to discredit a few of the most popular myths about fighting the “Battle of the Bulge.”
Mr. Baban has spent the past 10 years helping his clients fight the weight-loss battle—while separating truth from reality.
Myth 1: Men and Women Need to Train Differently
Contrary to what many marketing companies would lead you to believe, men and women do not need different exercises. As humans, we all perform the same day-to-day activities, such as walking, sitting, standing, and carrying babies, groceries, and suitcases. So it makes sense that squatting, a basic human movement pattern from the time we learn to move as infants, is equally as important and effective for both men and women.
It’s now a proven and mainstream fact that weight lifting does not immediately cause bulk or unwanted size. Women don’t need special pink or purple bands, they can and should perform the same workouts as men, should they desire.
Myth 2: Protein Is For Bodybuilders Only!
Protein has had a bad reputation for too long. An essential amino acid, protein consumption in itself will not cause you to look like a bodybuilder. In fact, it is a necessary tool in aiding with weight loss and positive body composition changes.
Protein is satiating, means it leaves you feeling full after consumption. This can help to reduce cravings for sweeter or unhealthier foods. Also, calories consume from protein are unlikely to cause fat gain, which means adding extra protein to your diet can help most to consume more overall calories without gaining body fat. In fact, protein consumption has been associated with helping create a higher metabolic rate, allowing the individual to burn fat more efficiently.
Myth 3: Long, Steady-State Cardio Sessions are the ONLY Way to Lose Fat
Long workouts on the treadmill, elliptical, and stationary bike are synonymous with weight loss. Come every January, these machines have lines for them at most chain gyms. By March, they’re covered in cobwebs. And while they are somewhat effective, for many these types of workouts are long, monotonous, and unenjoyable.
No problem. While steady-state cardio (long duration, moderate intensity) workouts have their place, incorporating higher intensity interval training along with strength training can be more effective.
Myth 4: Workouts Must be Extreme
It seems each decade has gone down in history for its own workout ideas.
The 80s were known for VHS home workout tapes
The 90s were known for circuit training with large isolation-type gym machines
While we can agree these weren’t the most effective ideas, they certainly weren’t as dangerous as the extreme workouts and diets the 2010s have brought us.
If you were to judge based solely on Instagram or YouTube, one might believe extreme workouts, whether it be degree of difficulty, duration, or frequency, were the only way to get in shape.
The truth is that for beginning exercisers, 2-3 workouts per week lasting 30-45 minutes, incorporating basic strength training movements is the sweet spot.
Myth 5: No Fun Allowed!
The more restrictive the diet plan and more extreme the workout plan, the lower the adherence rate is for most. For example, setting your alarm clock for a 5:00 a.m. workout might be tolerable the first time around, but it will soon become an unsustainable habit.
Instead of large changes, begin or alter your program by simply choosing one habit at a time to improve. Adding extra protein to your breakfast is solid start, as opposed to going 30 days without carbs.
Integrate your program into your lifestyle, and you will see a more fun and sustainable program, with longer-lasting results.

New rules on emissions control in Spain.
05.08.2018
The Spanish Government approved measures for the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants.
The purpose is to incorporate into Spanish law the provisions on the reduction of polluting emissions contained in Directive 2016/2284.
The decree regulates sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), ammonia (NH3) and fine particles (PM2.5). It also regulates the preparation, adoption and implementation of a national program for the control of atmospheric pollution.

Researchers at IIT-Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia successfully tested a new version of WALK-MAN humanoid robot for supporting emergency response teams also in fire incidents. The robot is able to locate the fire position and walk towards it, and then activate an extinguisher to eliminate the fire. During the operation, it collects images and transmits these back to emergency teams, who can evaluate the situation and guide the robot remotely. The new version of WALK-MAN robot has a new design, made of a lighter upper body and new hands, in order to reduce construction cost and improve performance.
The WALK-MAN robot was designed and implemented by IIT within the project WALK-MAN funded by the European Commission. The project started in 2013 and it is now at its final validation phase. The project also involved the University of Pisa in Italy, the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany and the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL) in Belgium. All partners contributed to different aspects of the robot realization: locomotion control, perception capability, affordances and motion planning, simulation tools, manipulation control.
The validation scenario was defined in collaboration with the Italian civil protection body in Florence, that participated to the project as an advisor end-user.
During the final test, the robot WALK-MAN dealt with a scenario representing an industrial plant damaged by an earthquake and where gas leaks and fire are present, thus a dangerous situation for humans. The scenario was recreated in IIT laboratories, where the robot was able to navigate through a damaged room and perform four specific tasks: opening and traversing the door to enter the zone; locating the valve which control the gas leakage and close it; removing debris on its path; and finally identifying the fire and activating a fire extinguisher.
The robot is controlled by a human operator through a virtual interface and a sensorized suit, which permits to operate the robot very naturally, controlling effectively its manipulation and locomotion, like an avatar. The operator guides the robot from a station located remotely from the accident site, receiving images and other information from the robot perception systems.
The first version WALK-MAN was released in 2015, but researchers wanted to introduce new materials and optimize design to reduce the fabrication cost and improve its performances. The new version of WALK-MAN robot has a new lighter upper-body, whose realization took 6 months, involving a team of about 10 people coordinated by Nikolaos Tsagarakis, researcher at IIT and coordinator of the WALK-MAN project.
The new WALK-MAN robot is a humanoid robot 1.85 meters tall, made of lightweight metal, like Ergal (60%), magnesium alloys (25%) and titanium, iron and plastics. Researchers reduced its weight by 31 kilos - from the originally 133 kilos, to 102 kilos - to make the robot more dynamic. Therefore, legs can move faster having a lighter upper body mass to carry. The higher dynamic performance allows the robot to react faster with legs, making step to maintain its balance under the effect of physical interaction disturbances - this is very important to adapt its pace to rough terrain and variable interaction scenarios. The lighter upper-body also reduces its energy consumption and the Walk-Man can operate with a smaller battery (1 kWh) for about two hours.
The lighter upper-body is made of magnesium alloys and composite structures, and it is powered by a new version of lightweight soft actuators. Its performance has been improved reaching an higher payload (10 kg/arm) than the original one (7 kg/arm), thus it can carry heavy objects around and sustain them for more than 10 minutes.
The new upper body is also more compact in size (62 cm shoulders width and 31 cm torso depth), giving to the robot a great flexibility to pass through standard doors and narrow passages.
The hands are a new version of Soft-Hand developed by Centro Ricerche E. Piaggio of University of Pisa (group of Prof. A. Bicchi) in collaboration with IIT. They are lighter, thanks to the composite material used to construct fingers, and they have a better finger-to-palm size ratio (more human like) that allows WALK-MAN to grasp a variety of object shapes. Despite their weight reduction, hands keep the same strength as the original version, as well as their versatility in handling and physical robustness.
WALK-MAN body is controlled by 32 engines and control boards, 4 force and torque sensors at hands and feet, and 2 accelerometers for controlling its balance. Its joints show elastic movement allowing the robot to be compliant and have safe interactions with humans and the environment. Its software architecture is based on XBotCore framework, YARP platform, ROS e Gazebo. The Walk-Man head has cameras, 3D laser scanner and microphone sensors. In the future it can be also equipped with chemical sensors for detecting toxic agents.
In June 2015, Walk-Man was the only EU-funded project to participate to the international robotics competition DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), launched by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to define the technological standards of the robots that may provide assistance in natural or manmade disasters. The challenge took place in Pomona (California, US) and the robot coped with a scenario inspired by nuclear incidents in Fukushima. In 2016 Walk-Man was tested in the real earthquake scenario, in Amatrice (Italy), to support the civil protection bodies team to perform an inspection of a damaged house and provide information about building stability as well as recovering personal belongings safely.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi-led coalition aircraft struck a military police camp in the Houthi-controlled Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday, killing at least 39 people and wounding 90 more, including some prisoners, an official and witnesses said.
The strike is part of an air campaign by the Western-backed coalition on the Iran-allied Houthis that has escalated since the Houthis crushed an uprising last week led by former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh and killed him.
One official in the camp said the coalition aircraft had launched seven raids on the camp, located in the eastern part of Sanaa, where some 180 prisoners were being held.
The official said rescue teams had pulled out 35 bodies from the rubble, while the rest were not accounted for.
It was the latest in a string of air raids the coalition has conducted on Sanaa and other parts of the country, sometimes causing multiple casualties among civilians.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. The coalition denies that it targets civilians.
The United States and Britain provide political backing as well as weapons and logistical support for the Saudi-led coalition, which has been fighting since 2015 to restore Yemen's internationally-recognised president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to power.

Both sides must use this Gaza truce to seek peace
THERE have been ceasefires and truces before which have failed within hours but so far, as we go to press, the temporary truce in Gaza is holding with the hope that the cessation of shelling will pave the way for peace talks and the slim possibility of a settlement which will work for both sides.

Protests against Israeli military operations in Gaza have taken place around the world[GETTY]
Formal negotiations are expected to begin in Cairo today. Hopes are not high as both sides appear to have sets of irreconcilable demands.
The demand for an end to Israel’s eight-year blockade of Gaza is matched by Israel’s demand that Hamas disarms. Meanwhile the political repercussions of this conflict have been felt here in Britain with the resignation of Baroness Warsi who branded the Government’s stance on Israel as “morally indefensible” while the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell says the UK should impose an arms embargo on Israel and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said there were “serious questions” about the arms export licences.
It is bad enough that the ill-informed chorus on social media sites have spent much time congratulating themselves smugly on how they have supported and put forward the Palestinian cause, blithely unaware that they are pawns in a propaganda game, while those with an anti-Semitic axe to grind have used this awful conflict for their own purposes too.
This is all bad, yet for leading members of the Government to now implicitly be supporting the aims of Hamas terrorists against one of the West’s allies in the Middle East is beyond belief. What a betrayal.

The pothole pensioners
Perhaps this is what David Cameron had in mind by the Big Society.
Earlier this week we heard about Somerset businessman Mike Watts who built his own toll road to open up a section of road near Bath that had been closed because of a landslip.
Now a group of pensioners have repaired the potholes in their road in Pudsey at their own expense because the council had failed to do it over several years.
When communities pull together like this it is always inspiring. No doubt the residents of Crawshaw Gardens are pleased to have a road that is no longer full of craters.
But more to the point the publicity for this action puts the skinflint slowcoaches of Leeds City Council to shame.
How dare they fail council-tax payers in this way for so long.

Gaza truce extended as talks give new hope
David Cameron is quite right to say Boris Johnson is a star player and indeed the PM needs him back on the pitch.
The London Mayor is without doubt one of the few who can cut through to the voters normally turned off by dealings in Westminster. He will be an essential tonic for the party in the run-up to next year’s General Election.
Mr Johnson, foolishly dismissed by many as too much of a buffoon last time he was in Parliament, has rebuilt his reputation as Mayor of London.
Conservative supporters will no doubt see him as the Heineken of politicians: he reaches voters that other Tories cannot.
His ability to engage with people of different ages, backgrounds and races sets him apart from some of the “grey, stale and pale” MPs axed in last month’s reshuffle. He is of that elite band of box office politicians and a good match for Ukip’s Nigel Farage – just imagine those two in a TV debate.
One group who will not be pleased about his return to national politics are the EU fanatics in Brussels. As Mr Johnson explained in the speech before his announcement, he would gladly lead Britain out of the EU if no reforms are agreed.

Victor Moses: What I think of my new role at Chelsea in Antonio Conte's 3-4-3 system
VICTOR MOSES insists he is relishing playing at right wing-back in Chelsea's new 3-4-3 formation.
By Charlie Phillippe

Moses has started the wins over Hull, Leicester and Manchester United and looks set to keep his place for today's trip to Southampton.

Victor Moses admits he has a good link up with Pedro at Chelsea
"I have just got to listen to what the manager asks me to do in that position, and the way he wants me to do it.
"Every game we play I just want to keep on improving. The more games you play, the more experience you get in that position. I’m really relishing it at the moment and enjoying it.
"It’s very important to understand your team-mates. I have got Azpilicueta there, the spare right-back, who is behind me, and he communicates with me and really helps me out to make sure I am in the right position.

Antonio Conte is set to stick with the same formation in Chelsea's clash with Southampton
"It’s very good to link up with Pedro or Willian, too. They know when it’s time for me to go or when not to go. We speak to each other and we look at each other’s movement to make sure we are doing the right thing on the pitch.
"Defensively we all work as a unit in training. We want to make sure we don’t get caught sleeping in a game. Every day in training the manager is on top of us to make sure we are solid at the back.
"It’s looking good for us at the moment, but we have to keep our feet firmly on the floor, try and keep the momentum going and hopefully win as many games as we can without conceding goals."

Don't write off Rangers
KENNY MILLER has warned people to write off double chasing Rangers at their peril.
PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:00, Thu, Mar 19, 2009
Kenny Miller
The Light Blues were heavily criticised after last weekend’s Co-operative Insurance Cup final defeat to Celtic and many believe they will also come off second best to their Old Firm rivals in the chase for the SPL.
Miller knows the Ibrox side have taken a knock but still believes they can finish the season on a double high with the SPL and Scottish Cup in the trophy cabinet.
Miller said: "That’s what happens. We were getting it in the neck for the majority of the season as we were playing catch-up.
"All of a sudden we’re top of the league and we weren’t getting any. Then we get beaten at home to Inverness and then in a cup final.
"I don’t think there was much in the final, a set piece in extra time has decided again which shows how important set pieces can be.
"That’s part and parcel of being at the Old Firm.
"We just have to be pick ourselves up and get on with it.
"We don’t worry too much about it as there are still 10 games left to win the league.
"If we win those 10 games, we win the league, plus we have the Scottish Cup to go for too.
"If we win those it’s a successful season."

Soil Laboratory Specialist to UNNATI
UNNATI - Inclusive Growth Programme in Nepal is at national level, but with focus on seven districts in the Eastern Development Region (EDR). The programme focuses on support to the private sector, and to local government through the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DoLIDAR) and the District Development Committees (DDCs) in the programme districts. The budget for the programme is approximately USD 70 million for the five-year period. The overall objective is promotion of sustainable inclusive growth that reduces poverty and raises living standards. UNNATI builds on three pillars: The Value Chain Component; The Infrastructure Component and The Enabling Environment Component. The three components are interlinked with the Value Chain Component as the core of the programme. ORGUT is contracted by Danida as the Management Contractor (MC) and provides the technical assistance to one sub-component of the Value Chain Component (1.1 Selected Value Chains) and to the entire Infrastructure Component (Component 2).
In order to prepare for the Value Chain development a need for a common soil testing laboratory was identified and a short term consultant hired to assess feasibility and modalities.

Primary Care Provider
Primary Care Providers (PCPs) can help meet the healthcare needs of children in foster care. The PCP works with members, Medical Consenters, caregivers, Superior Service Coordinators and other entities to make sure all the member’s medical and behavioral health needs are met. This includes screenings, referrals and authorizations for services and assessments that impact the member’s health.
Who can serve as a PCP?
Credentialed providers in the following specialties can serve as a PCP:
Family Practice
General Practice
Internal Medicine
Pediatrician
OB/GYN
Physician Assistant
Nurse Practitioner
Specialist (See below – Specialist as a PCP)
Specialist as a PCP
Superior allows members with chronic, disabling or life-threatening illnesses to apply to Superior’s Medical Director to use a provider contracted and designated as a specialist as their PCP. To be eligible to serve as a PCP, the specialist must meet Superior’s requirements for PCP participation. This includes credentialing and having a contract with Superior as a PCP.
Superior will approve or deny the request for a specialist to serve as a PCP and provide notification of the decision to the member no later than 30 days after receiving the request. When a specialist is approved as a PCP, Superior will provide the non-PCP specialist with a current directory of participating providers.
If the request is denied, the member may appeal the decision through the Superior’s member complaint and appeal process.
You can find a provider online or by calling Member Services at 1-866-912-6283.
Family planning
You can get your family planning services from your doctor or go to any family planning clinic that takes Medicaid. Superior members can receive family planning services without a referral from their PCP. Call Superior Member Services at 1-866-912-6283 if you need help finding a family planning doctor or clinic.

FTC Charges Web Site Billing Service with Contempt
FTC Charges Web Site Billing Service with Contempt
Agency Alleges Mercury Marketing-Go Internet Bills Consumers Without Their Authorization

For Release
August 12, 2003
The Federal Trade Commission has filed suit in U.S. District Court charging Mercury Marketing of Delaware, now doing business as GoInternet.net, and its principal Neal D. Saferstein with contempt of court. The agency alleges that Saferstein and Mercury continue to bill consumers for Internet-related services without consumers’ authorization in violation of federal law and a previous FTC Order. The FTC has asked the court for a hearing and for a temporary order to halt the illegal billing practices and to freeze the corporation’s assets to preserve them for consumer redress, pending a ruling on the contempt charges.
On June 28, 2000, the FTC filed its complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging that Mercury and Saferstein misrepresented that consumers were legally obligated to pay for the defendants’ Internet-related services. The complaint alleged that Mercury’s telemarketers cold-called small businesses nationwide offering to create a Web page, or advertisement on the Internet, for consumers and then billed them without their authorization. “In numerous instances, consumers who are billed for the defendants’ Internet-related services do not remember receiving the defendants’ telephone calls,” the complaint says. In other instances, the defendants allegedly billed consumers who said they declined to buy the services or agreed only to receive additional free information. According to the FTC, the defendants never asked consumers for credit card or other payment information, but later charged consumers on their telephone bills.
The defendants and the FTC agreed to a consent order, entered by the court on March 1, 2001. The settlement prohibits Mercury and Saferstein from misleading consumers and requires the defendants to reveal all material terms of the sales transaction prior to charging consumers. It also requires the defendants to obtain express, verifiable agreement to the terms of any sale they make and requires that the terms of any recorded portion of the sales call to be consistent with the terms of any non-recorded portion. In addition, it requires defendants to notify consumers they are billing that they can cancel and requires the defendants to provide refunds to those who did not authorize Mercury to bill them.
In legal papers filed in U.S. District Court on July 30, 2003, the FTC alleges that the defendants “have engaged in precisely the same deceptive and misleading practices that led to the FTC’s original action – billing consumers for their Web services without the consumer’s authorization.” The agency notes that as the result of increasing consumer complaints, the FTC reviewed Mercury’s business records, subpoenaed third parties, interviewed consumers, and surveyed Mercury’s customers to monitor compliance with its order. Despite the 2001 Order barring the illegal activities, the “conduct has not only continued, it has worsened,” the FTC told the court. “Simply put, defendants violate the existing order by billing consumers who they have misled.”
A survey of 417 random consumers pulled from a list Mercury provided to the FTC of its “current customers” found that:
• Less than one percent of Mercury’s customers (one person) indicated that they had agreed to hire Mercury to develop and maintain a Web page for their businesses.
• None of Mercury’s customers indicated that Mercury had provided services for their businesses.
• Most (72 percent) of Mercury’s customers were unaware that a charge of $29.95 had been appearing on their monthly telephone bills.
• Nearly 30 percent of Mercury’s customers claimed they attempted to obtain a refund.
According to the FTC, recent complaints and company billing records show defendants even bill consumers who have asked to be placed on the company’s Do Not Call lists. The FTC said the record demonstrates that “the defendants are engaged in a systematic and widespread effort to defraud consumers.”
Mercury also operates and bills consumers under the names Mercury Internet Services, Mercury Communications, Mercury, MIS, Mercury Internet Services Wireless, Venus Voice Mail, and/or Mercury Technologies. Using the name Venus Voice Mail, the defendants allegedly target residential telephone line subscribers.
If the court finds the defendants in contempt, the FTC will ask the court to order consumer redress and to permanently bar the illegal activities.
The original complaint, consent, and recent contempt action were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law. The case will be decided by the court.
Copies of the order to show cause why defendants should not be found in contempt are available from the FTC’s Web site at http://www.ftc.gov and also from the FTC’s Consumer Response Center, Room 130, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. The FTC works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint, or to get free information on any of 150 consumer topics, call toll-free, 1-877-FTC-HELP (1 877-382-4357), or use the complaint form at http://www.ftc.gov. The FTC enters Internet, telemarketing, identity theft, and other fraud-related complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to hundreds of civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad.

Congressional Democrats not impressed by Facebook and Twitter answers about whether Russians helped spread #ReleaseTheMemo

In a letter sent Wednesday, Congressional Democrats scolded the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter for failing to adequately investigate whether Russian-linked accounts amplified a campaign to release a controversial memo on the FBI’s Russia inquiry.
The memo in question was compiled by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and it alleges the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s connection to President Donald Trump’s campaign is politically motivated. #ReleaseTheMemo started trending on Twitter as Trump supporters demanded the memo be declassified; Congressional Republicans voted to do just that in a rare maneuver. Whether the memo will be released is now up to Trump. The intelligence community has expressed “grave concerns” about the memo’s release.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) initially contacted Facebook and Twitter after a site operated by The Alliance for Securing Democracy reported a 233,000 percent spike in the frequency of Twitter accounts promoting #ReleaseTheMemo over a 48-hour period. The organization runs Hamilton 68, a website dedicated to tracking Russian-linked accounts on social media.
Facebook’s answer was brief and largely punted to Twitter, saying “we welcome information about incidents that may have occurred on other platforms — in this case, on Twitter — because it can help us anticipate and understand new and evolving threats.” Facebook said it has shared all relevant information on Russian interference to date with Congress. Twitter’s response detailed some of the changes it has made since the 2016 election. The company said it’s initial investigation did not reveal “any significant activity connected to Russia with respect to Tweets posting original content to this hashtag.”
We are no closer to understanding Russia’s continuing interference in our democratic affairs.
Feinstein and Schiff were not amused. In the response they sent Wednesday the lawmakers admonished Facebook and Twitter for failing to answer three questions they initially raised: “whether and how many accounts linked to Russian influence operations were involved,” “the frequency and volume of their postings on this topic,” and the number of “legitimate” users exposed to the campaign.
“We are no closer to understanding Russia’s continuing interference in our democratic affairs,” the letter says.
Feinstein and Schiff responded with eight additional questions seeking details and data on the role Russia played in the #ReleaseTheMemo campaign. They asked the companies to respond by Feb. 7.
The letter sent Wednesday was first spotted by Recode.

Horowitz: Trump’s Ugly Nativism Runs Counter to Most Americans’ Views
Tuesday, November 03, 2015
Rob Horowitz, GoLocalProv MINDSETTER™

Rob Horowitz
A recent national poll from the highly regarded PEW Research Center, confirms that the ugly nativism Donald Trump is peddling while appealing to a substantial chunk of Republican primary voters, does not reflect the views of the majority of general election voters nor in many cases the majority of Republicans.
Nearly 3-out-of 4 American voters, and 2-out-of 3 Republicans favor allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the country if certain requirements are met. Even before considering whether Trump’s proposal for immediately deporting all 11 million or so undocumented immigrants is remotely plausible, they reject it out of hand. In fact, during the time period when Trump has been making this case and receiving saturation media coverage for it, support among Republicans for a path to legalization has increased by 10 percentage points.
Similarly, 3-out-of 5 Americans oppose changing the constitution to do away with birthright citizenship. In this case, a narrow majority of Republicans do favor this change. And while general election voters as a whole are split evenly on whether or not to build a wall across the entire Southern border, 73% of Republicans do support a border fence.
In the short-run, Trump’s hard core anti-immigration polices, coupled with his ugly and demagogic rhetoric is helping him to stand out and to build a solid base of support in a crowded field of candidates battling for the nomination., but it is also creating a nearly insurmountable obstacle to a winning general election candidacy, if he does emerge as the nominee.
Donald Trump is now poison to Latino voters with about 70% indicating an unfavorable opinion. More than one in 10 voters in the general election will be Latinos, and this percentage will be much higher in key swing states such as Colorado and New Mexico. Trump is on track to do even worse than Mitt Romney’s 27% of the vote in 2012—and that dramatically narrows if not all but eliminates his path to victory. Additionally, the position he has staked out on immigration will also hurt him with moderates and independents, which comprise most of the general election swing voters..
Unlike Donald Trump, most Americans support a comprehensive solution to immigration—one that honors our values and enables the nation to realize more of the renewal, innovation and growth which throughout our history has always followed a more expansive, welcoming approach. Given the way Trump's particularly nasty brand of nativism has dominated new coverage these past few months, this is no small comfort.

Kaiser Permanente | Kaiser Permanente Oregon Standard Bronze Plan
Kaiser Permanente Oregon Standard Bronze Plan is an Obamacare health insurance plan offered by Kaiser Permanente that is available for individuals and families.
This plan is a EPO, meaning you will have some of the flexibility to manage more of your health care without a primary care physician, however, you will need to stay within the provider’s network. (Read more about EPOs.)
This plan is a Bronze metal level plan, which generally has a lower monthly cost but higher annual deductible (and co-pay), and provides basic insurance coverage for people who do not spend regularly on health care (i.e., doctors, prescription drugs, etc.).
Deductible amount of $7,150. A deductible is the amount of healthcare costs you will pay on your own each year before the insurance company.
Max out-of-pocket of $7,150, which is the most you will pay in a plan year outside of premiums, out-of-network providers and non-essential health benefits.

Who is this plan for?
This plan with a lower monthly cost is great for healthy individuals and families who rarely, if ever, visit the doctor or use prescription drugs. The very high deductible on this plan means you will pay a significant amount of money of pocket for medical care and prescriptions before your insurance kicks in. The very high out-of-pocket maximum on this plan means you could be faced with a very expensive medical bill if an emergency happens.
HealthCare.com is a privately-held website for healthcare consumers operating since 2007. We’re not the government marketplace.

"FICO First, Then Sex": Credit Surveillance and American Character
Sarah Fenton | Sep 1, 2017
Equifax, Experian, TransUnion: hardly names you’d give the characters in a classic story. And chances are, they’re not names you know much about. But they know about you. Together—as Josh Lauer explains in Creditworthy: A History of Consumer Surveillance and Financial Identity in America (Columbia Univ. Press, 2017)—the nation’s three largest credit bureaus “track the movements, personal histories, and financial behavior of nearly all adult Americans.” So thorough are their methods that personal finance guru Suze Orman believes they should determine not only whether you buy a house, car, or cell phone, but even whom you date. “FICO first,” she suggests (in reference to your prospective partner’s credit score), “then sex.”
Credit cards, which allow consumers to carry interest-generating balances, illustrate what Lauer calls the “monetizing logic of digital capitalism.” Nick Youngson/CC BY SA 3.0
As Lauer put it in a recent interview, Orman’s advice treats creditworthiness as “a category of moral knowledge.” To be determined a good risk is to be judged “honest and industrious.” A poor credit score, on the other hand, reflects not only bad bookkeeping or a modest income but more—a want of “integrity or work ethic.” Lauer’s point here was not about novelty: credit reporting has a long history, one entwined with broader questions of individual worth and virtue, and investigated by such historians as Lendol Calder, Martha Olney, and Louis Hyman. What’s new, he suggested in the interview, is how simultaneously sweeping and opaque consumer data has become, reaching into every corner of our lives while being “coded in ‘objective’ numbers that neutralize the explicit tone of moralizing.”
Rather than commit what Lauer calls “the sin of technological determinism” and treat this development as one more inexorable result of advances in computing, in Creditworthy he treats it historically: as the result of human endeavor (and folly). The book is divided into roughly three sections and begins in the wake of the Revolutionary War, when an informal flow of credit functioned more to circulate wealth than to compromise or diminish it, creating commercial opportunities for Americans with more gumption than capital. Lauer quotes an early 19th-century Austrian immigrant who compared the Old World—where credit was provided only to those with substantial collateral, either land or inherited wealth—to the New, where the practice of extending credit helped chip away at hierarchies rather than fortify them: “In America the case is different. Men there are trusted in proportion to their reputation for honesty and adaption to business. Industry, perseverance, acquaintance with the market, enterprise, in short, every moral qualification of a merchant increases his credit as much as the actual amount of his property.”
A poor credit score reflects not only bad bookkeeping or a modest income but more—a want of “integrity or work ethic.”
Lauer does not use Creditworthy to refute this picture—as boosterish, say, or ideologically blinkered—but to largely confirm it. Early 19th-century loan applicants “with a reputation for hard work and honesty could generally count on receiving credit.” In a marketplace where “trust was a function of familiarity,” lending practices were personal: open to white men who neither “loafed, lied, or repeatedly bungled their affairs.”
But as the panic of 1837 made plain, early 19th-century demographic changes and economic volatility had altered the contours of the credit market. “As the nation’s population became more numerous and mobile,” Lauer writes, “one was more likely to transact with strangers.” Calculating what risk outsiders posed and successfully collecting on debts gave rise to ever-lengthier inked ledger books then to proprietary credit-scoring algorithms and finally to a national credit infrastructure in which “no digital presence goes untracked, no digital profile goes unmined,” and remaining a stranger takes conscious effort or genuine eccentricity. But it was that early “confounding task of deciding whom to trust and whom to invest in” that led, in fits and starts, “to the development of systematic credit surveillance in the United States.” Louis Hyman—who’s also an editor of the Columbia University Press series to which Creditworthy belongs—reframed this “confounding task” for me in 21st-century terms: “At the center of the recent financial crisis was the simple question: to whom should money be lent?”
How that question was answered—and by whom—occupies Creditworthy’s middle stretch. The data broker industry that is today dominated by a few mammoth firms grew out of “a motley array of private agencies and voluntary protective associations” that compiled “blacklists of debtors and delinquents” based on scattershot data painstakingly collected from municipalities, employers, landlords, banks, merchants, and eventually from utility companies and healthcare providers. During the Progressive Era, the industry was consolidated and its methods made more complex, but its aim remained the same: to “quarantine poor credit risks.” That ambition changed in the 1920s, as credit bureaus began to understand the profit potential of packaging information itself as a commodity and shifted “from an instrument of prevention to one of promotion.”
It is also the moment his villains take the stage, albeit facelessly. Lauer understands the transformation he traces in the book’s first third as a trade-off—one with significant but not perverse or arbitrary costs. In a short piece written for Technology and Culture after the 2008 financial crisis, Lauer made the case that free markets “are never really free” but instead comprise social webs and commercial practices—credit, contracts, and investment decisions among them—that “necessarily ensnare even the politically free in bonds of economic dependency.” Americans live willingly with a “Faustian deal,” having long ago traded their “agrarian self-sufficiency for the heady promises of far-flung interdependence.” Lauer depicts that decision sympathetically: as a compromise with global capitalism but not capitulation.
Less gentle is his treatment of the 20th-century credit bureaus that morphed into ever-larger private firms fixed more on raising revenue than avoiding debt. In Creditworthy’s timeline, that transformation “signaled a major development in the history of American business practice.” As an unnamed president of the Associated Credit Bureaus of America (which led the consumer reporting industry in the 1950s) put it, “credit bureaus were started as a deterrent to putting bad credit on the books.” They had evolved: “Now, credit and credit bureau functions are sales tools.”
A practice once held in low repute—selling customer lists—quietly became the norm, and in an unholy alliance with the postwar advertising industry, banks and credit bureaus developed increasingly sophisticated ways to “monitor the financial performance of consumers and calibrate credit access—expanding or curtailing—to maximize profitability.” Borrowers who failed to pay off loans quickly and in full, once regarded as undesirable credit risks, were now seen as exciting sources of revenue. The ideal loan candidate was no longer an enterprising immigrant who paid small debts back promptly; instead, he was an already overleveraged shopper, susceptible to targeted marketing campaigns and willing to carry “an interest-­generating balance without maxing out.”
In the 1920s, credit bureaus began to understand the profit potential of packaging information as a commodity.
When Lauer here refers to ordinary Americans trapped on “the treadmill of debt,” Creditworthy changes course, moving further afield from that optimistic young Austrian and toward the current senior senator from Massachusetts. Elizabeth Warren’s 2014 memoir, A Fighting Chance, catalogs the congressional compromises and court rulings made in the 1980s and ’90s that weakened public protection from predatory banking practices and culminated, she believes, in the 2008 financial crisis. The people Warren interviewed for the Consumer Bankruptcy Project—launched in 1986 to determine the exact factors that led so many citizens onto the road of increasing credit debt and eventual bankruptcy—did not strike her (in Lauer’s memorable phrasing) as loafers, liars, or bunglers. Families who were sometimes homeless, often insolvent, and always “desperately ashamed of their situation” inspired her fight for the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Lauer described in the interview as “absolutely essential.” Founded in 2011, the CFPB is now facing a full repeal, and it is worth asking why. Answering that question brings us to the final section of Lauer’s account, which focuses on surveillance, and a further darkening in tone.
However critically he regards methods of mass credit that “trapped Americans in the bondage of debt,” Lauer sounds downright dystopian when describing the ways that system “also ensnared them in bonds of institutional surveillance.” Two congressmen have recently submitted bills to shut down the agency Warren created, working together (as they put it) to sound “the alarm on the CFPB’s federal overreach.” But what Creditworthy makes clear is that citizens have willingly given commercial surveillance systems a breathtaking scope that they would never allow the state. Consider the outrage that greeted Edward Snowden’s National Security Agency leaks revealing the vast reach of the nation’s intelligence-gathering apparatus. Now consider this: in 2012, according to Lauer, “the data broker industry produced $156 billion in revenue . . . more than double what the US government allocated to its own intelligence budget.”
Lauer’s interest in surveillance stems not only from specific concerns about privacy, but from broader questions about what he calls the “monetizing logic of digital capitalism” and a culture that chooses to invest the marketplace with the power to determine the “measure of human value.” Should prompt payments on desirable merchandise be evidence of trustworthiness and sound principles? Suze Orman believes they should. Still, it’s worth asking whether appointing Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion to take the measure of an American’s character surrenders something more elemental than “agrarian self-sufficiency,” a deal with the devil that even Faust might have declined.

How Mid-Ocean Wind Farms Could Power The Whole Of Civilisation
It could provide all the electricity in the world, and it’s right on our doorstep.
By Thomas Tamblyn
Imagine if you could provide all the electricity for entire planet, and all it would take is just one small part of the ocean?
Well new research from Carnegie’s Anna Possner and Ken Caldeira suggests that this could in fact be possible and it’s all thanks to wind.
According to their research, wind farms in the North Atlantic could provide sufficient energy to meet the entire planet’s needs over winter. In the summer this would drop significantly but it would still be enough to power the whole of Europe.
AASE/SHUTTERSTOCKCOM
How is this possible? Wind speeds are, on average, much higher over ocean than they are over land, which means that theoretically wind farms in the open ocean could capture five times more energy than wind farms on land.
Until now though, this was just a theory and there were serious questions about whether it was as straightforward as simply saying faster winds means more electricity.
“Are the winds so fast just because there is nothing out there to slow them down? Will sticking giant wind farms out there just slow down the winds so much that it is no better than over land?” Caldeira asked.
Much of the energy that is captured by large wind farms is brought down from the higher atmosphere. Other studies have then also demonstrated that there is a maximum amount of energy that land-based wind farms can capture from this.
Which raises the question, would wind farms over the ocean suffer these same constraints or would the atmosphere be able to move more energy downward over the ocean?
To try and answer that question Possner and Caldeira created complex modelling tools which compared land-based wind farms in Kansas with theoretical wind farms that would be built far out in the ocean.

The results were extremely promising.
“We found that giant ocean-based wind farms are able to tap into the energy of the winds throughout much of the atmosphere, whereas wind farms onshore remain constrained by the near-surface wind resources,” Possner explained.
In fact those ocean-based wind farms were able to generate as much as three times more energy than their land-based counterparts.
While open water wind turbines are still very much in their infancy, there is hope that this research will provide strong incentives for companies to start developing the technology at a faster rate.
In a statement to HuffPost UK, Emma Pinchbeck, RenewableUK’s Executive Director said: “The UK is the world leader in offshore wind and we have just built the first floating wind farm off the coast of Scotland. The advent of this innovative technology will allow us to harness powerful wind speeds at much greater depths.”
“It’s clear that floating offshore wind could play a key role in combatting climate change, helping us make the vital transition to a low-carbon economy. Our current offshore wind fleet, for example, is already powering over 5% of all the UK’s electricity, and we are on course to double that by 2020.”

Jill Schary Robinson
Jill Schary Robinson is a Los Angeles-based novelist, essayist, illustrator, and teacher, whose memoirs contend with the themes of addiction, recovery, and growing up during the golden age of Hollywood.
Jill Schary Robinson is author of several renowned memoirs, including With a Cast of Thousands, Bed/Time/Story, and Past Forgetting. She is the daughter of Dore Schary, the Oscar and Tony Award winning writer, producer, and head of MGM. As a copywriter for the advertising agency FCB, Robinson trained with Helen Gurley Brown. Robinson also wrote on women’s issues for Cosmopolitan and covered political trials for the Soho Weekly News. Her first memoir, With a Cast of Thousands is about her experiences growing up among celebrities such as Jane Fonda, Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor and Adlai Stevenson.She also interviewed political and film personalities on KPFK and KLAC. Robinson’s memoir about drug addiction Bed/Time/Story, was turned into a TV–Movie called "A Cry For Love". She reviewed books and wrote articles for the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Vanity Fair, Washington Post, and American and French Vogue. During the 1980s, Robinson relocated to London and wrote a series of columns on being an American in Britain for London’s Daily Telegraph. Her Vanity Fair story on Roman Polanski was included in George Plimpton’s book The Best American Movie Writing for 1998. In 1999 Author Jonathan Lethem described 1999's Past Forgetting as a "quietly moving memoir recounting that great rarity, a truly encompassing and persistent loss of memory." [9] Robinson and her husband Stuart Shaw also performed on cruise ships, reading their play Falling in Love When You Thought You Were Through (adapted from their memoir, published in 2002). In 2005, Robinson was given a lifetime grant to develop the non-profit Wimpole Street Writers program, which continues both in London and Los Angeles. In 2009, she was instrumental in saving the Motion Picture and Television Fund's retirement home.

Unrigging the Rules: How This Funder Is Taking on Inequality
November 28, 2017 / Philip Rojc

Anna Lefer Kuhn began as executive director of the Arca Foundation in 2008, the week Lehman Brothers collapsed. During the crash and its aftermath, she says, it became clear that the financial sector’s concentrated economic and political power had rigged the rules in favor of the rich, exacerbating inequality.
That belief isn’t exactly unusual, especially on the left. But according to Kuhn, philanthropy’s response has been underwhelming. “What struck the foundation was that there was a robust set of organizations working on inequality issues, but very few that had the capacity and infrastructure to respond to the [2008] crisis.”
We’ve written before about conservative funders, often with modest assets, that have patiently underwritten policy research and advocacy work. Those funders have built and nurtured a strong infrastructure that melds together research, communications and legislative outreach to advance right-wing ideas. Conservative foundations have given particular attention to funding work on issues like financial regulation and fiscal policy that aren't sexy but have huge implications for how the economy functions—and who gets what.
Arca is also a smaller foundation, with around $50 million in assets. Over the years, it has taken a similar behind-the-scenes approach in its domestic grantmaking, but with a very different set of priorities in mind. It sends a steady stream of support to think tanks, media initiatives and grassroots organizers who want to hold Wall Street to account. Recent grantees range between research groups like the Institute for Policy Studies, the Economic Policy Institute and the Roosevelt Institute, and on-on-ground players like Illinois’ Grassroots Collaborative and Color of Change. Some of its funding flows through intermediaries like the Tides Foundation, the Proteus Fund and the New Venture Fund.
Arca’s resources are modest, but its grantmaking is significant, given that many progressive funders aren't so focused on structural reforms to the nation’s economy. While we report often on efforts to reduce inequality by foundations like Kellogg, Ford, Annie E. Casey and Open Society, much of this grantmaking sidesteps larger issues about how economic life is organized and, especially, Wall Street's outsized role and influence. Many of the big liberal funders have spent a lot more on “raising the floor,” as Kuhn puts it, than on unrigging the system.
That observation tracks with IP's coverage of inequality funding. We've seen major grants supporting causes like labor rights, asset building or early childhood education. But nearly a decade after the sub-prime mortgage crisis, there's still only limited funding for work on financial regulation—even as Republicans push to roll back reforms passed after the crisis. Arca's biggest grant both this year and last, for $125,000, supported Americans for Financial Reform, the coalition group that's been leading the fight for stronger oversight of Wall Street—yet has only around a dozen staff. Initiatives that critique globalization and free trade have long had an even harder time landing grants, leaving these issues to be weaponized by Donald Trump during his run for the presidency.

Since the 2016 election, Kuhn sees smaller foundations as key players in the fight against systemic inequities. She told me, “A lot of the most exciting organizing in this moment was nonexistent five years ago. Emerging leaders and organizations are engaging folks in new ways on complicated structural issues.” Smaller foundations, she said, “took the risk with some of these groups. That’s the role of smaller foundations: Be in early on issues that may be complicated.”
Racial justice is a case in point. While some larger funders like Kellogg have been active in the area for a while, the current push for leadership from people of color and other impacted communities draws on support from smaller supporters, including community foundations.
Kuhn says Arca’s focus on racial justice has increased in recent years. But that work remains tied to the foundation’s general campaign against the “financialization” of American life. When a downturn occurs, or when financial practices are at their most extractive, Kuhn says it’s often communities of color (and low-income areas in general) that are the most affected.
Those effects often play out on the local level, despite financial reform’s frequent portrayal as a national issue. Change, according to Arca, must come from below and work its way up. As we’ve written before, a pivot to the states and localities makes sense for progressive funders facing a hostile Washington D.C. Kuhn believes “it’s a priority to support coalitions and organizations that bring together grassroots groups with national groups.”
She cites Arca’s support for organizations like Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, as well as the Roosevelt Institute’s Refund America Project. In other words, efforts that blend policy clout with the energy of an engaged grassroots. If it worked for the Tea Party, maybe it’ll also work for the resistance.

This all smacks heavily of politics, but despite Arca’s progressive bona fides, Kuhn doesn’t see a focus on inequality or even racial justice as fundamentally “leftist” or at odds with conservative Americans. She has a point, given that there was plenty of intense anger on the right about bailing out Wall Street after the financial crisis. Unfortunately—and bizarrely—that anger was harnessed to a right-wing populism that's only made Wall Street more powerful while fostering new racial divisions. Still, Kuhn sees the potential to create a broader push to rein in financial and corporate interests. “If you look at the politics of the moment, and the rise of a populist movement, we can have a movement to unrig the rules of the economy that’s not about blaming those most impacted.”
What’s ironic is that some firms like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citi, to name a few, have been rolling out their own philanthropic efforts to ostensibly reduce inequality, often by boosting job prospects for youth and communities of color. These projects, Kuhn says, pursue “different goals” and put “Band-Aids on the wounds without addressing how the economy is functioning, or who doesn’t have power.” The research sphere itself has been subject to the same tension, as think tanks derive increasing support from corporations—Brookings being a prime example.
We wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the funding efforts by banks, which include substantial infusions of capital into community financial development institutions and major grants for capacity building by local nonprofits working on poverty. But Kuhn is right that these funders have zero interest in disrupting the economic status quo at a deeper level—a status quo in which Wall Street remains a major winner.
Whatever the case, one thing seems clear: There's plenty of room for new grantmaking that's focused on the structural workings of the economy and that challenges the financialization that's occurred in recent decades and is deeply implicated in high levels of inequality. Arca may be small, but it's become a leader in this all-important niche.

He is Pastor Goodheart Ekwueme, the outgone (as much as I hate to use that) resident pastor of my local assembly in Abuja. I and all those who knows him, are going to miss him soooooooo much, it hurts.

Violence Against Men, Mnombo Madyibi and The VAPP Bill
By JENNY CHISOM October 12, 2016
Quite some fuss has been on about this man in picture MnomboMadyibi who was allegedly hit with a bottle of wine and also suffered attempted suffocation using a red and white teddy bear. But as expected it did not get as much attention like if the switch was fixed (the experience being that of the woman).
We must know that if men keep being treated like non humans, even the violence against women we usually fight for, will only increase astronomically, since after all a woman must live and find her fulfilled being married to a man or at least living and being in relationships with them.

Why get employment contracts
An employment contract lawyer can help you legally bind a contract between an employer and employee. It’s helpful to use an employment contract or get an employment contract review if you are hiring a new employee and want to specify rights and obligations like salary, benefits, and hours. It’s also common to see provisions covering confidentiality, noncompetition, and invention assignments. Although an employment contract or employment contract review isn’t required, relying on an oral agreement with your employees can cause problems. It’s important to document things so that everyone is on the same page. What is most important to understand is that as with most contracts, there are advantages and disadvantages for each term so it’s important to draft and review it correctly.
The benefits
Confirm your legal compliance
Employment law carries a series of rules with it. Violating a law or duty that you owe to an employee or can have expensive repercussions. The assistance of an employment contract lawyer can quiet these concerns.
Have an employment contract lawyer to turn to
There’s a good chance you’re going to like your employment contract attorney from LawTrades and want to keep using them. Perfect - now you have a legal expert to turn to when in need.
Documents tailored to your business
Some companies will implement a template found online to use as an employment agreement. This carries risk as every employment contract should have unique terms to reflect that particular relationship.

Frequently asked
questions
Is it necessary to use employment contracts for my employees?
No not at all, but it’s a great look for HR purposes. It’s important for employers and employees to be on the same page. An employment agreement is the perfect tool to nail down the terms of employment so that no ambiguities exist.
As an employer, should I have an employment agreement for my at-will employees?
An increasing number of employers are utilizing employment agreements in order to document the at-will relationship. It’s difficult for employees to argue they have rights such as only being terminated for just cause if they sign an agreement in the beginning that describes that they are only at-will employees.
Can I use a “do it yourself” or template website?
Those sites have major limitations, largely in that their forms are standardized and may leave out important details specific to your company. Because employment contracts are legally binding, it’s encouraged for employers to use employment contracts that are custom drafted.
Are employment agreements the same as independent contractor agreements?
Not exactly, but they’re similar. You can find independent contractor agreements here.
Do the employment contract lawyers on LawTrades help with employee handbooks?
Yes, the employment contract lawyers on LawTrades have experience both drafting and reviewing employee handbooks.

Stocks close lower as U.S.-China trade war fears reignite
Feb. 7, 2019 at 4:34 p.m. ET
by William Watts
Spectrum Brands reports surprise loss as sales fall more than expected
Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. reported Thursday a surprise fiscal first-quarter adjusted loss and revenue that fell below expectations. The stock was still inactive in premarket trade. The parent of Pfister, George Foreman and Remington brands swung to a net loss for the quarter to Dec. 30 of $112.5 million, or $2.11 a share, from a profit of $507.4 million, or $15.55 a share, in the same period a year ago, which included a benefit related to tax reform. Excluding non-recurring items, the adjusted loss per share was 20 cents. The FactSet consensus was for earnings of 38 cents a share. Revenue fell 4.9% to $874.6 million, missing the FactSet consensus of $911.0 million, as a 6.4% decline in hardware and home improvement (HHI) and a 7.3% drop in home and personal care (HPC) sales offset 1.1% growth in pet supplies. The decline in HHI sales was due primarily because of strong hurricane-related growth a year ago, while the HPC sales decline was driven by lower personal care revenue. The stock has shed 14% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 has slipped 2.9%.

What Donald Trump’s rise says about ad value equivalency
Posted by Jennifer Zingsheim Phillips
Date: April 26, 2016
Donald Trump’s rise in the world of politics may have come as a shock to many in the GOP, but it isn’t the bombastic front-runner’s opinions that have rankled some: it’s the seemingly never-ending media coverage he’s been able to garner, practically since day one of his candidacy.
The amount of earned media Trump has received is notable, even by presidential race standards. The New York Times attempted to quantify the coverage back in March, when they noted that if Trump had purchased advertising that encompassed the same amount of time as the media coverage he’s received, the total price tag would be $2 billion.
If the logic behind this calculation sounds familiar, you’re probably thinking of AVEs—advertising value equivalencies. And just like regular AVEs, the New York Times estimate misses the mark. The value of Trump’s earned media is probably far higher than a straight dollar-to-paid ad comparison.
Why? Well, think of how a person responds to political advertising. Now think of how a person generally responds to watching news coverage. There’s a difference, isn’t there? Paid political advertising, even when it’s done well, is still paid coverage. Most people who aren’t political science majors probably get a fair amount of aerobic exercise launching for the mute button on the remote when political ads come on—but they choose to watch news coverage.
Saying that Donald Trump has received $2 billion in “free” advertising from media coverage because he didn’t buy that time and run political ads makes the same false equivalence between advertising and earned media coverage that AVEs make. It’s a ridiculous measurement standard because the audience reaction and receptivity to the content is strikingly different.
The media don’t want to admit it, but their coverage of Trump went a long way in propelling his campaign forward.
And they really don’t want to admit it. Luke Thompson has a fascinating analysis demonstrating that contrary to media assertions that they simply covered Trump’s rise, they actually were devoting considerable airtime to him well before he started rising in the polls.
This brings us to the question of exactly why Trump has received such a lion’s share of the news coverage over the course of his candidacy. He does have a knack for saying things that get him on the news, that’s true. But there has to be more to it than that, right?
Of course there is, and it’s a dollars issue for the news networks and cable organizations. Back in September 2015, AdAge ran an article (as did others) noting that CNN was asking for—and presumably getting—40 times its usual rate for commercial advertising space during the GOP debates. In late February of this year, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves said of Trump’s candidacy: “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” He followed with a “the money is rolling in” statement, just so we’re all perfectly clear what he meant by that.
In addition to this being a rather chilling indictment of what motivates the news industry, it also very clearly illustrates that Trump’s media coverage has been worth far more than the $2 billion estimated by the New York Times—both to the candidate himself and the news organizations covering him.

(Reuters) - No U.S. nuclear power plant has been penetrated in a cyber attack, an industry spokesman said on Saturday, when asked to comment on a U.S. government warning last week about a hacking campaign targeting the sector.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a report dated Wednesday that nuclear sector was among those targeted in a hacking campaign data back to at least May.
Hackers used "phishing" emails to obtain credentials to gain access to networks of their targets, according to a report from the two agencies, which Reuters reported on Friday.

“None of America’s 99 operating nuclear plants have been penetrated by a cyber attack," said John Keeley, a spokesman for industry trade group Nuclear Energy Institute.
If a plant's operations had been breached, that would require mandatory notification to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which would notify the public, he said.
Those requirements do not cover cyber intrusions on business networks of firms that operate nuclear power plants, said Keeley. He said had no information as to whether such attacks had occurred.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Victor Dricks declined to comment on the joint report, saying the agency does not comment on security-related issues.
The report from the FBI and Homeland Security, which was reviewed by Reuters on Friday, did not identify any victims or describe the impact hackers had on targeted networks.
It did say that cyber attackers have historically "targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict."
Homeland Security and FBI officials did not respond to requests for comment on the report, which was dated June 28.

My heart broke Tuesday night
My heart broke Tuesday night, as I watched the unthinkable happen. Hillary Clinton, the most qualified presidential candidate ever to run in my lifetime, was defeated by a racist, sexist, mysoginist, bullying, pathological liar.
Of course, it didn’t help that Clinton was a woman.
Ironically, she won the popular vote, but our antiquated electoral-college system gave it to the other guy.
What has happened to our country? What is happening in the world?
I have always known the U.S. was a racist, sexist country, but never knew just how racist and sexist until now. Yet when there is an infection, a festering wound, the puss that comes out also leads the way to healing.
Hopefully that is what will happen here. Seeing what is wrong in our country is the first step to fixing it.
I know that many people didn’t like Hillary Clinton, and I think that most of that dislike was undeserved. I have followed her career for decades, and admired her grit and dedication.
People have called her too guarded, but if you had her history, you’d be guarded, too. Women of our generation who have pursued professional careers had a big mountain to climb to pave the way for those who came after. I was once turned down for a job by being told, “you’re very well qualified but I’m afraid if I hire and train you, you’ll get pregnant and leave.” [There are laws against that now, fortunately.]
I remember her being vilified for taking on a big cause [healthcare] as First Lady, when most First Ladies promoted simpler, less controversial causes.
I saw her vilified for going by her maiden name, Hillary Rodham – so much so that she ended up going back to the last name of Clinton to silence the critics. I’ve written before about the questionable habit of women taking their husband’s last name when they marry. That’s a holdover from the days when women were considered the property of their husbands. Haven’t we come farther than that?
She was criticized for standing by her husband when it was revealed he had an affair, and criticized by others for not leaving him. Make up your mind, America.
Hillary has told the story of sitting for the law school bar exams and, when the proctor left the room, men in the room would make catcalls telling the women to get out because women shouldn’t be lawyers. What do you do in the face of such misogyny? Put your head down, your guard up and, keep on going. Of course she’s guarded, as most women are who have been through that shit.
I have been astounded at, and saddened by, the lies spread about her and readily believed. Because she’s a woman; because she’s the first, because she had the audacity to run for an office always held by men.
Her wounds are every woman’s wounds.
I have admired her grace and determination under pressure; her decorum and dignity in debates when her opponent constantly interrupted and threatened her. She has been inspiring.
“I still believe as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us.” Hillary Clinton concession speech
The resurrection of the Goddess
There was a time in the early history of humanity that God was viewed as a woman.
How we went from female/earth-based religions to patriarchy is the subject of a legion of books that I won’t go into here.
In actual fact, in ancient times, it would be male and female energies together, because the Divine is both male and female. When you don’t honor both, you leave half of God out of the equation.
If you go back to Aramaic, the original language of Christ, you will find that The Lord’s Prayer which today starts with “Our Father” should more accurately be translated as, “Father, Mother, God.”
In early history, the Earth was our Mother and honored as such. In my experience, native peoples still honor the earth, but the influence of Christianity has caused many to change their view of the Creator back to male.
When I was traveling through Mexico a year ago with my Maya teacher, I noticed that many of the shrub-covered hillsides were pyramid shaped. I asked him if there were old Maya ruins under them. He replied that, indeed there were, and that only a small percentage of all the Maya cities have been excavated and dug out.
He also said they’ve discovered that the newest ruins being excavated were originally dedicated to the Divine Feminine. And that the Maya believe that now is the time for the return of the Divine Feminine to bring balance back to the earth and her people.
So we had this amazing opportunity to bring back the feminine in the form of a female president of the United States. And what happened? The male patriarchy shot her down.
Because it’s time for the Divine Feminine to return, the patriarchy will fight that much harder to repress her. And we just can’t let that defeat us,.
To a great extent, this election was influenced by three white male organizations:
The FBI, the KGB and the KKK, among other forms of patriarchy:
The FBI by Director Comey inappropriately announcing a week before the election that there were more emails to be examined, then a week later announcing, oh, never mind, there was nothing wrong there.
The KGB by Russians hacking Democratic Party emails and releasing them to Wikileaks who in turn released them to the world. Big investigation and hearings over Hillary’s emails and, once again, there was nothing wrong there.
The KKK – the white supremacist organization – which supported Donald Trump and gave voice to a large segment of our population who are filled with hate against anyone not white.
By a concerted voter suppression effort to keep the poor, and minorities, away from the polls because those segments of our society tend to be Democrats.
By fear. “My life/job/finances aren’t working, so let’s make a dramatic change in our government and see if that helps.”
By a failure in our education system to teach Civics – how our government works. A shocking number of our populace haven’t read the U.S. Constitution and don’t understand how our democracy works. They think that a president can make sweeping changes that they simply can’t without the support of Congress.
And the Divine Feminine in the form of Mother Earth is under attack by corporate greed and pollution and oil companies who keep building pipelines that break and pollute our waters and land. Raping the land, raping the Mother.
I could go on, but I’m sure you get the drift.
The Earth is a woman and she is the one that lost Tuesday night- she is hurting just as we all are by the sudden realization that our society is not as enlightened as we had hoped. That we are not all as safe as we thought we were.
But we can be, if we don’t get discouraged. If we continue the fight for the environment, for voting rights, for equal rights for all; if we sign petitions, work and donate to causes we believe in.
To my fellow women: don’t feel defeated in in the face of discrimination, sexual harassment and disrespect. Find your inner warrior and follow the Maori teaching: “Know who you are and stand tall.”
So that the next time a woman runs for any elected office, she will win with ease, because the warrior in all of us will fight hard to support the Maya prophecy of the return of the Divine Feminine. Our country will be ready because we paved the way.
And how do you defeat hate and darkness?
By being the light.
By going high when they go low.
Praying for those stuck in fear and darkness.
“When you don’t get the leader or government or luck you want in life, you get 30 minutes to sulk. Then you get up and get to work being the change you want to see in the world. The only real loss is in resigning your beliefs and efforts because of a few setbacks.” Brendon Burchard.
There you have it – do the work, raise your vibration.
Be kind to everyone because we all need it now.
Find a cause you believe in and fight for it.
See the best in people; don’t gossip and don’t believe gossip [that goes for you, Hillary-haters]. Do your homework rather than blindly believing every post on Facebook.
The light always outshines the darkness.
Together we can resurrect this nation, and world, to something better.
“Never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it.” Hillary Clinton

Often called the "happiest place on Earth," the park gives children a chance to meet their favorite Disney characters. But one can imagine that the experience was a whole lot less magical in the '50s, when the characters were more creepy than cute.
Yikes!

This Windex-shaped iPhone case is $95 and already sold out
mashable.com
Keep your phone calls squeaky clean. Now you can own a Windex bottle for an iPhone case — that is, if Moschino restocks the sold out item.
This is one of the dumbest things that I have ever seen.

Say it ain't so: 6 Mars hoaxes you keep falling for
mashable.com
Every year in August, the same Mars message circulates across the Internet: The Red Planet will appear "as big as the full moon" in the sky, as seen with the naked eye. The problem is, it's not true: Skywatchers won't be able to see a "double moon" in the late August sky.

In Defense of Hipsters
thrillist.com
Exterminate hipsters!
Not the people. The people are fine -- inasmuch as anyone even knows what they are anymore. A few are great, some are annoying, most are probably pretty unremarkable, same as with everything else. I’m saying exterminate the word "hipsters."
Personally, I am not a fan of the hipsters. Almost all of them that I know are shallow and afraid of growing up. But this article does make some great points about the nature of recycled culture.

Trader Joe's is an amazing company -- a company that even sent me a $5 gift card just for writing it a letter. I get good vibes from its employees, and I love its food. But TJ's corporate has a reputation for being secretive.

Here’s How to 3D-Print Your Own Crossguard Lightsaber | TIME
time.com
The crossguard lightsaber introduced in the trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens raised eyebrows among skeptics as much as it elicited drools from those excited by the weapon’s redesign. Attacks on its impracticality were so widespread that Stephen Colbert took time out of one of the final episodes of the Colbert Report to defend the genius of the design.
If I had a 3D printer, I would actually consider this.

In 1978, the Associated Press awarded their Male Athlete of the Year Award to New York Yankees pitcher Ron Guidry while golfer Nancy Lopez took the Female Athlete of the Year honors. With all due respect to Mr. Guidry and Ms. Lopez, the AP made a terrible choice. 1978's most talented athletes were, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Kenny Loggins and The Runaways' Sandy West.

Trump Revives Border Wall Fight With $8.6B Proposal
President Trump is reviving his fight to fund a border wall. A new proposal calls for $8.6 billion, doubling what Mr. Trump has already set aside. It is six times more than what Congress was willing to approve to end the fight that shut down the government. (Published Monday, March 11, 2019)
President Donald Trump proposed a record $4.7 trillion federal budget for 2020 on Monday, relying on optimistic 3.1 percent economic growth projections alongside accounting shuffles and steep domestic cuts to bring future spending into promised balance in 15 years.
The deficit is projected to hit $1.1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, the highest in a decade. The administration is counting on robust growth, including from the Republican tax cuts — which Trump wants to make permanent — to push down the red ink. Some economists, though, say the bump from the tax cuts is waning, and they project slower growth in coming years. The national debt is $22 trillion.
Even with his own projections, Trump's budget would not come into balance for a decade and a half, rather than the traditional hope of balancing in 10.
Still, Trump contended the nation is experiencing "an economic miracle." He said in a letter to Congress accompanying the plan that the country's next step must be "turbocharging the industries of the future and establishing a new standard of living for the 21st century."
Presidential budgets tend to be seen as aspirational blueprints, rarely becoming enacted policy, and Trump's proposal for the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, sets up a showdown with Congress over priorities, including his push for $8.6 billion to build the U.S-Mexico border wall.
Titled "A Budget for a Better America: Promises Kept. Taxpayers First," Trump's proposal "embodies fiscal responsibility," said Russ Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Despite the large projected deficits, Vought said the administration has "prioritized reining in reckless Washington spending" and shows "we can return to fiscal sanity."
Trump Border Emergency Survives as House Veto Override Fails
The budget calls the approach "MAGAnomics," after the president's "Make America Great Again" campaign slogan.
Some fiscal watchdogs, though, panned the effort as more piling on of debt by Trump with no course correction in sight.
Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Trump "relies on far too many accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions and puts forward far too few actual solutions." She warned the debt load will lead to slower income growth and stalled opportunities for Americans.
Trump on Mueller Probe: ‘We Can Never Let This Happen to Another President’
President Donald Trump addressed the media about the summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump presidential campaign during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu Monday.
(Published Monday, March 25, 2019)
Perhaps most notably among spending proposals, Trump is reviving his border wall fight. Fresh off the longest government shutdown in history, his 2020 plan shows he is eager to confront Congress again over the wall.
Trump's budget proposes increasing defense spending to $750 billion — and building the new Space Force as a military branch — while reducing nondefense accounts by 5 percent, with cuts recommended to economic safety-net programs used by many Americans. The $2.7 trillion in proposed spending cuts over the decade is higher than any administration in history, they say.
The budget imposes work requirements for those receiving food stamps and other government aid as part of the cutbacks. The Department of Housing and Urban Development faces a 16 percent cut and for Education, a 12 percent reduction.
Lawmakers Denounce Plan to Divert Military Money for Wall
Trump's budget would re-open two health care battles he lost in his first year in office: repealing "Obamacare" and limiting future federal spending on Medicaid for low-income people. Under the budget, both programs would be turned over to the states starting in 2021.
The plan sticks to budget caps that both parties have routinely broken in recent years. To stay within the caps, the budget shifts a portion of the defense spending, some $165 billion, to an overseas contingency fund, which some fiscal hawks will view as an accounting gimmick.
Conservatives railed for years against deficits that rose during the first years of Barack Obama's administration as tax revenue plummeted and spending increased during the Great Recession. But even with Republican control of Congress during the first two years of the Trump administration, deficits were on a steady march upward.
AG Barr Says Mueller Probe Found No Russia Conspiracy
House Democrats are calling for the release of the full report from special counsel Robert Mueller, after a four-page summary from Trump appointee Attorney General William Barr say Mueller's team found no evidence of conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election season.
(Published Monday, March 25, 2019)
The top Democrat on the Appropriation Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said the budget is "not a serious proposal."
By refusing to raise the budget caps, Trump is signaling a fight ahead. The president has resisted big, bipartisan budget deals that break the caps — threatening to veto one last year — but Congress will need to find agreement on spending levels to avoid another federal shutdown in the fall.
The Democratic chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, called the proposed cuts to essential services "dangerous." He said Trump added nearly $2 trillion to deficits with the GOP's "tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations, and now it appears his budget asks the American people to pay the price," the Democrat said.
Dems Not Giving Up on Russia Probe; Trump Visits Republicans
While pushing down spending in some areas, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the proposal will seek to increase funding in others to align with the president's priorities, according to one official.
The administration would boost Veterans Affairs funding by $6.5 billion, or 7.5 percent, and says reducing veteran suicides would be a top priority.
The budget provides $291 million to "defeat the HIV/AIDS epidemic" with hopes of eliminating 90 percent of new infections within 10 years. It would also increase resources to fight the opioid epidemic with money for prevention, treatment, research and recovery, the administration said.
Barr Releases Statement on Findings in Mueller Investigation
Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the 2016 election determined that nobody from the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr.
(Published Sunday, March 24, 2019)
It provides $500 million in new spending over the decade on child cancer research.
The proposal will also include $1 billion for a child care fund that would seek to improve access to care for underserved populations, a White House official confirmed. The one-time allocation is championed by the president's daughter Ivanka Trump, who has focused on economic advancement for women in her role as a White House adviser.
It also provides $200 billion toward infrastructure, much lower than the $1 trillion plan Trump once envisioned. The plan says that money would be leveraged with private dollars, but Congress has largely panned that approach.
Mueller Told Barr Weeks Ago About Obstruction Stance: Source
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump's budget "points a steady glide path" toward lower spending and borrowing as a share of the nation's economy. He also told "Fox News Sunday" there was no reason to "obsess" about deficits, and expressed confidence that economic growth would top 3 percent in 2019 and beyond. Others have predicted lower growth.
The border wall remains a signature issue for the president and is poised to stay at the forefront of his agenda, even though Congress has resisted giving him more money for it.
Leading Democrats immediately rejected the proposal.
Trump Calls Mueller Probe 'an Illegal Takedown That Failed'
President Donald Trump called special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation 'an illegal takedown that failed' on Sunday
(Published Sunday, March 24, 2019)
"Congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. They said the money "would be better spent on rebuilding America."
In seeking $8.6 billion for more than 300 miles of new border wall, the budget request would more than double the $8.1 billion already potentially available to the president for the wall after he declared a national emergency at the border last month in order to circumvent Congress — although there's no guarantee he'll be able to use that money if he faces a legal challenge, as is expected.
Along with border wall money, the proposed budget will also increase funding to increase the "manpower" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Customs and Border Patrol at a time when many Democrats are calling for cuts — or even the elimination — of those areas. The budget also proposes policy changes to end sanctuary cities, the administration said.
Analysis: A Cloud Lifts Over Trump, But at a Cost
The budget arrives as the Senate readies to vote this week to terminate Trump's national emergency declaration. The Democratic-led House already did so, and a handful of Republican senators, uneasy over what they see as an overreach of executive power, are expected to join Senate Democrats in following suit. Congress appears to have enough votes to reject Trump's declaration but not enough to overturn a veto. The standoff over the wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.
The wall with Mexico played a big part in Trump's campaign for the White House, and it's expected to again be featured in his 2020 re-election effort. He used to say Mexico would pay for it, but Mexico has refused to do so.

Minimum wage won't let you afford a 2-bedroom rental anywhere in the country, report says
Posted: 4:44 PM, Jun 14, 2018
Updated: 2018-06-14 21:44:31Z
By: CNN
There's not a single state, county or metropolitan area in the entire United States where a full-time worker earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour can afford a modest 2-bedroom apartment.
And if those workers wanted to? They'd have to work 122 hours a week. Every week. All year.
This is according to a new report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, or NLIHC, which calls attention to the gap between low-income wages and the high cost of rent throughout much of the United States.
The NLIHC found US workers need to earn $22.10 an hour to afford a "modest" two-bedroom rental. That's about three times the federal minimum wage.
"This year's findings," the report says, "demonstrate how far out of reach modestly priced housing is for the growing low-wage work force, despite recent wage growth, and for other vulnerable populations across the country."
Here's a breakdown of the report.
How did they get these numbers?
The hourly wage the NLIHC uses throughout the report is called a "housing wage."
The NLIHC based that figure on what the Department of Housing and Urban Development calls "fair market rent," an estimation of how much a family would expect to pay in a given area.
The NLIHC then used that number to determine how much a full-time worker has to earn without spending 30% of their income on housing.
How do the states stack up?
In Arkansas, where housing costs are lowest, workers still need to earn $13.84 an hour to afford a 2-bedroom home. The average fair market rent in Arkansas is $720 and the minimum wage is $8.50, the report notes.
The average fair market rent in Hawaii is $1,879, the most expensive in all 50 states. Though the state recently raised its minimum wage to $10.10 , households still need to earn $36.13 per hour to afford that 2-bedroom home.
Here are the top 10 most expensive states, including Washington, D.C.
And the metro areas?
The disparity is starkest in major metropolitan areas.
San Francisco tops the list for the cities with the most expensive housing wage. Workers there have to earn $60.02 an hour on average to live in a 2-bedroom rental.
Of the 10 most expensive metropolitan counties, eight are in California, one is in New York and one is in Hawaii.
Here are the most expensive metropolitan areas:
Would it be cheaper to rent a one-bedroom?
A little, but not by much.
On average, workers still need to earn $17.90 an hour to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment.
In 22 out of 3,000 counties nationwide could workers earning minimum wage afford to rent a one-bedroom, the NLIHC says.
According to the report, a worker earning minimum wage would have to work 99 hours per week all year long to afford a one-bedroom home. That's about 2.5 full-time jobs.
How can this issue be addressed?
The report calls out President Donald Trump and his administration, which has proposed cutting funding for federal housing assistance .
Earlier this year, HUD Secretary Ben Carson announced a proposal to triple the rent for households receiving federal housing assistance, and require they pay 35% of their gross income in rent, instead of the current requirement of 30%.
Carson said the proposal would help address rising costs of providing housing assistance, which he said currently helps only one in four families who qualify.
Trump's proposed cuts for the 2019 fiscal year, the NLIHC report says, would "lead to the largest reduction in affordable housing and community development investments in decades," taking "vital federal rental assistance" from 200,000 families.
But rather than cutting assistance, the report says, the government should continue to invest in housing programs that help the lowest-income households.
"The affordable housing crisis demands that we think big and act boldly," writes Sen. Bernie Sanders in the report's preface.
"In the richest country in history," he says, "no family should have to make the awful choice between food on the table and keeping a roof over their heads. This is America. We have the resources to solve the affordable housing crisis."

Kanye says he still supports Black Lives Matter, women’s rights, gay marriage in new clip
Adam Bychawski Nov 18, 2016 8:45 pm GMT
In a newly uncovered recording from West's San Jose gig, the rapper says he still backs Black Lives Matter
Kanye West told a crowd at a recent concert that he still supports Black Lives Matter after revealing that he would have voted for Donald Trump.
In new footage from the rapper’s San Jose show last night (November 17), West backed the US protest movement and said that his views on women’s rights and gay marriage haven’t changed despite his surprising disclosure.
“That don’t mean that I don’t think that Black Lives Matter,” he said. “That don’t mean I don’t think that I’m a believer in women’s rights. That don’t mean I don’t believe in gay marriage. That don’t mean that I don’t believe in these things because that was the guy I would’ve voted for.”
West prompted boos from the audience earlier during the gig after he said he would have backed Trump in the US elections.
“I told y’all I didn’t vote, right?” he said. “But if I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump.”

West also reiterated his intention to run for office in the 2020 elections and said that he has already begun preparations.

Despite the revelation, West has previously financially backed Hillary Clinton. As Spin points out, Federal Election Commission records show that West has made four individual contributions to the Democrats since 2012 as well as a $2,700 donation to Hillary for America in July 2015.

Our Services
We are the Nit Pickest Professionals
With each female louse laying up to 10 microscopic eggs a day, it is critical to kill the existing lice and remove all nits to break the life cycle.
Treating lice with toxic Over the Counter or Prescription solutions can expose your children to dangerous side effects. Home treatments take 3-5 weeks of reapplication and hours of daily combing to break the lice life cycle. Most lice treatment clinics require 3 weekly visits to remove all lice. While our competitors offer all natural treatments, your valuable time is consumed with weekly appointments and worrying about emerging lice.
There is an easy and safe way!
For one low fee, you will leave our clinic
​LICE FREE in about 2 hours.
100% Guaranteed!
​​Our professionally trained practitioners are highly skilled at removing lice, nits, and breaking the life cycle​. Our Full Service treatment combines up-to-date, scientifically supported lice removal techniques with our painstaking combing methods for the most effective lice removal process possible. First, we apply our non-toxic, pesticide free, and hypoallergenic head spray to completely saturate the hair. Next, we comb the hair in specific patterns and sections to achieve the most thorough comb-out possible. We continue to saturate the hair with enzymes during this process, as we continue to comb in overlapping patterns to completely remove all lice and nits. This process usually takes about 2 hours per person.
After we have combed around the head several times without finding any lice or nits, we dry the hair. Drying and detangling the hair gives us a clean slate so we are better able to start the final step in our process. We check the hair piece by piece, strand by strand, to both tactilely and visually (with LED mighty magnification) to check for any remaining lice debris and remaining nits. We will then saturate the hair again with our Picky Pam Pure head lice spray as a preventative finish. Our customers get to choose a stylish braid of their choice!
We recommend that our clients purchase a Picky Pam Terminator Comb and Picky Pam Pure All Natural Head Spray to complete preventative aftercare to reduce the risk of re-infestation. The aftercare work, coupled with our lice removal services, makes treatment at our facility virtually foolproof and infallible.
Head Lice Diagnostic Screening - $15
A head lice diagnostic screening is a visual inspection of the scalp and hair. We use magnifying goggles and special LED lights and part the hair in small sections, looking for evidence of lice and or nits. We do wet checks with enzymes and a terminator comb to ensure our visual accuracy. The fee for the head check is waived if a full treatment is needed and purchased. Cost: $15 per person.
Full Service Treatment FAQs
What should I expect after the treatment service?
​We will arm you with the knowledge and tools to prevent reinfestation.
Included in the full service treatment, you will receive a bottle of dimethicone to apply 11 days after treatment.
We recommend saturating your hair with our all natural enzymes for 7 days following treatment and comb every other day (4 days) with a Terminator Comb.
ONCE A WEEK, TAKE A PEEK! Checking for lice regularly at home will help you stay on top of lice before they take over.​
How much does treatment cost?
We recommend our Full Service Treatment as the most effective method of removing lice. Treatment fees are based on hair length (click hair length for example).
Short Hair - $79.20 reg $99
Medium Hair - $95.20 reg $119
Long Hair - $111.20 reg $139
​Discounts available for our Full Service Treatment
$10 discount for each additional family member treated after the first two.
Families on Medicaid pay a flat rate of $89/person.
Comb out treatment for children under 2 years old is $49.
Complementary Head Lice Diagnostic Screenings for Teachers
10% discount if treated by a competitor (and still have lice)
Visit Special Offers for details on services and product discounts
​All treatment times are capped at 2 hours per person. Most infestations can be cleared within 2 hours. If you’d like for us to continue to remove debris after the 2 hour mark, you will be charged at a rate of $49 per hour or $12.25 every 15 minutes, whichever is appropriate based on how much longer you’d like us to continue combing.
Do you treat children under 4 years old?
​​In the event that we need to treat a child under 4 years old, we will not perform the final drying and checking. We find that children under 4 are generally very impatient by the end of the comb out process. The price of their treatment will remain the same, but that price will include 2 re-checks (at day 7 and day 14)
What discounts are available?
$10 discount for each additional family member treated after the first two.
Families on Medicaid pay a flat rate of $89/person.
Comb out treatment for children under 2 years old is $49.

The Many Ongoing Public Transportation Projects of the Bay Area
When Traffic Solutions Cause Travel Delays
Opinion: Even the Green New Deal Repeats the Same Old Sprawling Mistakes
A Movie About Gentrification
A film by Jim McKay explores issues of gentrification, race, and stereotypes.
July 12, 2004, 8am PDT | Abhijeet Chavan | @legalaidtech
Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Comments
"With a cast comprised almost entirely of people of color, many unfamiliar faces, 'Everyday People' explores issues of gentrification, challenges notions of race and stereotypes, and considers how money affects the lives of a group of people who work together...
With a gentle, serious tone, McKay's film toys with the stereotypes that shape our own expectations and imagines the lives of people we might very well encounter on a daily basis: a tough girl cashier, an uptight urban professional, a preaching activist pavement-pounder, an emerging female poet, an eager-to-please restaurant host, a surly dishwasher, and a teenager heading to college."

Bill Adding Do-Not-Track Disclosures to CalOPPA Passes California Senate
Aug 312013
August 31, 2013 Posted by Dissent Laws
Mali Friedman writes:
Last week the California Senate unanimously approved a bill requiring that operators of commercial websites and online services that collect personal information disclose how they respond to “do-not-track” signals from web browsers and whether they allow third parties to engage in online tracking. The legislation, which was introduced by Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, has been sponsored by CA Attorney General Kamala Harris.

Fear lurks in the financial world
Economic forecasters are unable to predict the dynamics of the recession into which Europe and America are plunging.
European Voice
By	Stewart Fleming	
11/12/08, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 4:51 PM CET
It would be unfair to say that the economic forecasts that government agencies are producing these days are not worth the paper they are written on. But it is unfortunate that mathematical economic models are not capable of capturing with any precision the dynamics of the recession into which the European and American economies are now plunging.
In three weeks’ time (4 December), the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to revise its projections of growth and inflation for the eurozone. Comments on Tuesday (11 November) from Guy Quaden, a member of the Governing Council of the ECB and governor of the National Bank of Belgium, are raising expectations that the bank will slash its 2009 growth forecast from September’s projection of 1.2% to zero and the inflation to 1.9% (from 2.6% in September). Julian Callow of Barclays Capital suspects that Quaden and his colleague Yves Mersch, the Luxembourg central bank governor, are laying the groundwork for another cut in the ECB’s policy interest rate, perhaps to 2.75% in December and even 2.25% in February.
Callow says that one problem which economic forecasters face is that, even at the best of times, econometric models do not portray what is going on in the financial sector, a big problem in a desperate financial crisis. There is no way, for example, to predict from the past behaviour of the price of assets such as shares how they will move in the future.
Gummed-up lending
Similarly, at a time when interbank lending is gummed up and banks are cutting back their lending to businesses and consumers on a scale that has not been seen in time of peace since the 1930s, predicting what comes next is more art than science. In the UK in September, home-loan volumes slumped by 57% compared with a year ago, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Caution by banks is widespread around the EU. Nobody knows when confidence will rebound and when lending will pick up.
On 3 November, in its autumn economic forecast, the European Commission estimated that eurozone growth would fall from 1.2% in 2008 to 0.1% in 2009. But it also carried out a simulation on a new economic model that attempts to take some account of the deepening credit crisis. This showed that growth could easily turn negative in 2009 – minus 0.8%.
But it is the words officials are using – and not using – as much as the figures they are presenting, which best reflect the fearful mood.
Against the backdrop of plummeting business confidence, it is noteworthy that in his 6 November press conference, after announcing a surprisingly aggressive cut in the policy interest rate from 4.25% to 3.50%, Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, refused to rule out a eurozone recession. He talked, as did the Commission, about a recent “broadening” of the financial market turmoil and highlighted the way a vicious circle could be developing with the tumult in the financial sector hitting consumers and businesses and this feeding back into the banking business in the shape of bankruptcies and loan losses. “The world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects as tensions increasingly spill over from the financial sector to the real economy and from advanced economies to emerging market economies,” he said.
Deflation
Lurking unsaid by officials, but increasingly common among private sector economists, is the fear that, as in the 1930s, the world could be facing not disinflation (a modest recession and a shortish period of slowing price increases or even falling prices) but true deflation, a protracted period of generally falling prices and output, and sharply rising unemployment.
In 2001-02, the US Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan cried wolf and summoned up the then unlikely spectre of deflation to justify a reckless slashing of interest rates, so laying the foundations for the sub-prime disaster. In June 2002, the Fed produced a superficial research paper ‘Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan’s Experience in the 1990s’, to justify its actions. But in 2008 the global deflationary threat is being taken more seriously – and rightly so.
Germany, which used the good economic times to get its budget deficit under control, is proposing to loosen the national purse strings to boost the sinking economy. France, by contrast, which is likely to breach next year the Stability and Growth Pact’s 3% deficit limit as a weakening economy hits the public purse, has been arguing for a co-ordinated EU stimulus package. Outside the eurozone, the UK government is planning a tax-cutting and fiscal stimulus package even though an excessive deficit procedure – under the Stability and Growth Pact – has already been opened against it.
Such is the uncertainty and fear about the economic outlook, however, that such plans have not met much criticism. As Callow puts it: “If ever there was a case for a fiscal stimulus, it is now.”

Staff unions threaten more strike action
THE European Commission is facing the possibility of another one-day strike within the next fortnight if it fails to settlefundamental differences with the staff unions over internal reforms.
European Voice
By	Rory Watson	
5/6/98, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 3:17 AM CET
The unions are continuing to raise the spectre of a further 24-hour stoppage on 20 May. Last week's industrial action brought theCommission to a halt as staff protested over the lack of consultation on possible changes to their salaries and workingconditions.
The date has not been chosen at random. It is the day Commission President Jacques Santer and his colleagues will hold aspecial seminar to examine the role the institution should play in the 21st century and the internal reforms needed to carry it out.
There is no suggestion that this Commission meeting will discuss staff salaries or employment regulations. But the high-levelgroup which is to be established to work on the short strategy paper prepared for the meeting by the Commission'sSecretary-General Carlo Trojan may broach these issues later.
Personnel Commissioner Erkki Liikanen met union leaders yesterday (6 May) for the first time since last week's strike, to try toresolve the outstanding issues.
These include union consultationon any possible changes to the staff employment statutes, a reassessment of employee appraisal procedures and the status ofofficials on fixed-term contracts.
Meanwhile, one of the major stumbling-blocks between the two sides has quietly disappeared.
Liikanen's refusal to declare 'null and void' the informal 'issues paper' drafted by former Commission official Tony Caston,raising ideas for possible reform, was the final trigger for last week's strike.
The unions had unsuccessfully demanded that the 59-page document be taken off the Commission's website. Liikanen refused,arguing that such a move smacked of censorship and infringed an individual's right to self-expression.
But on the day of the strike, the paper, which had been consulted by more than 1,000 officials, was quietly and without anyannouncement removed from the site.
Supporters of reform argue that the document had served its purpose in kick-starting the wider debate on reform of EUemployees' salaries and employment conditions, and so was no longer necessary.
But its removal will undoubtedly be seen as a victory by the unions, who were also jubilant that 93% of Commission staffanswered the strike call.
The exact figure, however, will only be known next Friday (15 May) when officials will have to return forms declaringwhether their absence was because they were on strike, ill, or on holiday.
One outcome of the dispute is a move, mainly by younger Commission officials unhappy at the way events have escalated, toestablish a new staff association.
The several hundred people involved have been communicating with each other by e-mail over the past few weeks and arecurrently drawing up the new organisation's statutes.
"There is lack of transparency on both sides. The management is riding roughshod over procedures and the unions are doing alot of damage by not recognising the need for reform. We do not want to take over from the staff unions, but we want to improvedialogue and promote a constructive approach," explained one of those involved.

Libraries
The following is a list of libraries from ProgrammableWeb's Library Directory that matched your search term. Although there many different interpretations of the word "library" among software developers, ProgrammableWeb adheres to a specific definition so as to clearly distinguish libraries from SDKs and frameworks in a way that will facilitate clean search results. In ProgrammableWeb's parlance, the term "library" is strictly used to describe a platform-specific software tool that, when installed, results in the provisioning a specific API. Conversely, SDKs are exclusively for consuming APIs and Frameworks are agnostic to specific APIs. If you think a library, SDK, API, or other asset is missing from our directory, be sure to check our guidelines for making contributions to ProgrammableWeb.

Amateur Status – “Give Back”
Tuesday 29 March 2016
Australia’s new wave of elite professional golfers will be some of the first helping fund the future of Australian golf under a ground breaking new “Give Back” programme.
In 2012, Rule 2-2 of the Rules of Amateur Status was amended to permit amateurs to enter into an agreement with a national golf union or association to pay back the investment in the player’s development when they turn professional.
As a result of this Rule change, since 2015, Golf Australia’s national or rookie squad players have signed a commitment to be part of “Give Back”.
Once the players turn professional and reach a world rankings threshold – top 125 for men and top 50 for women – a small percentage of their prize money will be returned to high performance programs throughout Australia.
This money will be reinvested into helping develop the future stars of the game.
No athlete will be asked to give back for more than five years, nor more than the funds they received through the programme when they were participants. There is no compulsion for players who don’t reach those benchmarks to contribute and endorsement deals are not taken into account.
Professional golfer, Minjee Lee is part of Golf Australia’s Give Back programme
Money will only be given back once an athlete reaches his or her sixth year as a professional. This allows athletes the time to establish themselves before the commitment begins.
Golf Australia chief executive Stephen Pitt announced recently the “Give Back” programme.
“In essence, when graduates of our high performance squads reach a certain threshold in professional world rankings each year on the world’s top tours, they will put some of their earnings back into the GA high performance pot for the next generation,” Pitt said.
“We could not be prouder that our brightest young talent are effectively putting their hands into their pockets to say thanks to all those who’ve helped them achieve their professional goals.
“It says everything about them as people, not just athletes that they’re prepared to help the next wave push through by giving them the same opportunities they received to reach their potential.”

Lady Gaga’s ARTPOP is still a a few months away, but the pop star has been steeling herself for backlash in many of her early public statements about the LP.
“Dont focus on ANY blogger criticism. I have been a producer/songwriter/musician for over 10 years. Trust the artist bloggers are not critics,” she tweeted on August 11. In a follow-up post, she added, “#STOPHarassingTheArtist we are here to entertain you.”
Lady Gaga’s Wildest Looks
Gaga tackles the same topic again in a fresh teaser for ARTPOP, a video trailer titled Lady Gaga Is Over: A Film by Haus of Gaga. In the 47-second clip, the “Applause” of the album’s first single is replaced by the sound of jeers. Gaga, her face covered in plastic, stars grimly at the camera as messages appear on the bottom of the screen:
“If you don’t like pop music, you should turn this off.”
“Lady Gaga is no longer relevant.”
“Ever since Born This Way, she’s a flop.”
“DO NOT buy her new single ‘Applause’ on iTunes.”
“Give her no A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E.”
“DON’T dance to the song at all.”
Reverse psychology? Criticism as art? Hear “Applause,” which recalls Gaga’s early work on The Fame, here.

Agriculture and Food Acid Rock Drainage (ARD)
SGS is a global technical leader in the field of Acid Rock Drainage (ARD, also known as acid mine drainage) testing with years of global experience addressing the acid generating potential of projects.
We have earned the reputation as an organisation that truly understands acid rock drainage testing.
The characterisation of the acid-producing potential of ores is a vital component in the management of ARD and the prevention of long-term environmental liabilities. SGS offers comprehensive laboratory analysis of leachates, solids and effluent. We understand why you need to mitigate ARD and can provide you with extensive analysis including the following standard ARD tests:
Standard ASTM Humidity Cell Test
Static Net Acid Generation (NAG) Procedure
Modified Acid Based Accounting (ABA)
US EPA 1311 Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP)
US EPA 1312 Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure
Mineralogical identification of acid generating and neutralising mineral phases
SGS understands the key to a successful testing programme is proper sampling technique. All SGS sampling and laboratory analysis is performed in accordance with recognised global standards such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organisation (ISO). Our qualified staff operate in laboratories with state-of-the-art instrumentation and use industry best practices.
Environmental Mineralogy
SGS can perform a full mineralogical characterisation of rocks, ore and tailings to determine its acid generating or acid neutralising potential. From such characterisations, acid generating minerals (e.g. pyrite, marcasite, pyrrhotite) and acid neutralising minerals (e.g. calcite, dolomite) can be quantified. The ratio of these minerals and their locking or liberation characteristics will determine if a sample will be a net acid generator, thus providing data that will assist with environmental planning, closure planning, and rehabilitation. This type of fundamental data can then be used to determine project costs.
Whether you are in the early characterisation stage during exploration, prevention stage during operations or a more advanced remediation phase during closure, SGS is the technical partner you can trust. We have an unsurpassed reputation for delivering quality testing and data to help you resolve environmental challenges. Work with us to ensure your ARD testing needs are dealt with in an effective and environmentally responsible manner.

Chemical ATEX 137 and DSEAR Compliance Services
ATEX/DSEAR installation compliance services from SGS – protect workers from fire and explosion risks.
The UK Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (DSEAR) are concerned with protection against risks from fire, explosion and similar events, arising from the use of dangerous substances in the workplace. The regulations set out minimum requirements for the protection of workers from fire and explosion risks related to dangerous substances and explosive atmospheres.
Our services to installers and users of explosion protected equipment complement our ATEX and IECEx Equipment Certification Services.
DSEAR legal duties
DSEAR became part of UK law on 30 June 2003. It imposes duties on employers and the self-employed, and is the UK transposition of European Directive 1999/92/EC. Similar legislation applies throughout most of the world and our services can be adapted to local legislation anywhere.
Although the legal framework in Europe is based on ATEX, the same international standards are applicable anywhere in the world, albeit sometimes with minor adaptations for local conditions:
IEC 60079-10-1 Area Classification – Gases and Vapours
IEC 60079-10-2 Area Classification – Hazardous Dusts
IEC 60079-14 Equipment Selection and Installation
IEC 60079-17 Installation Inspection
Compliance services
With a vast amount of experience in these standards and in explosion protection generally, we provide a comprehensive range of installation compliance services. This unique service is provided by our professionally qualified and experienced staff, all experts in their field, who deliver practical, pragmatic advice and guidance to our customers to assist them in meeting the challenges of compliance with local regulations. Our services include:
Hazardous area health checks
User risk assessments
Hazardous area classification (BS EN 60079-10-1/-2 & Industry Codes)
Implementation, planning and project management
Plant and operational hazard analysis
Management system auditing and plant inspection services
For more information about how our ATEX/DSEAR compliance and explosive atmosphere services can support your business, contact us today.
A UK world leader for a world-wide service
Based in Buxton, Derbyshire, SGS Baseefa’s staff has over 300 years experience of Ex equipment between them and is a major contributor to developing the standards for Ex equipment, at UK, European and international level.

Boeing crisis
Piece found in Boeing wreckage shows jet was set to dive, source says

A screw-like device found in the wreckage of the Boeing 737 Max that crashed last Sunday in Ethiopia indicates the plane was configured to dive, a piece of evidence that helped convince US regulators to ground the model, a person familiar with the investigation said late on Thursday night.
US Federal Aviation Administration chief Daniel Elwell on Wednesday cited unspecified evidence found at the crash scene as part of the justification for the agency to reverse course and temporarily halt flights of Boeing's largest selling aircraft.

Up until then, American regulators had held off as nation after nation had grounded the plane, Boeing's best-selling jet model.
The piece of evidence was a so-called jackscrew, used to set the trim that raises and lowers the plane's nose, according to the person, who requested anonymity to discuss the inquiry.

A preliminary review of the device and how it was configured at the time of the crash indicated that it was set to push down the nose, according to the person, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.

The jackscrew, combined with a newly obtained satellite flight track of the plane, convinced the FAA that there were similarities to the October 29 crash of the same Max model off the coast of Indonesia.
In the earlier accident, a safety feature on the Boeing aircraft was repeatedly trying to put the plane into a dive as a result of a malfunction.
All 157 people aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 died early Sunday shortly after the plane took off.
The pilot reported an unspecified problem and was trying to return to the airport. The plane crashed near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. The plane's crash-proof recorders have been sent to France to be analysed.
The discovery of the jackscrew was earlier reported by NBC News.

Nick Kyrgios offers heartfelt message to injury-plagued Andy Murray

Australian tennis player and self-described "joker" Nick Kyrgios has posted a heartfelt message to "old friend" Andy Murray, after the injury-plagued British tennis legend announced the upcoming Australian Open might be his last tournament.
Writing in a Facebook post on Friday following Murray's emotional press conference, Kyrgios described his relationship to the Scot as "like a little bit of a younger brother".

"You will always be someone that impacted the sport in so many different ways, I know this was never the way you wanted to go out, but hey it was a heck of a ride," he said of Murray's revelation he had planned to retire after Wimbledon this year but may be forced to hang up the racket early.
"You took me under your wing as soon as I got on tour, and to this day you have been someone I literally just look forward to seeing.

"You are one crazy tennis player, miles better than me, but I just want you to know that today isn’t only a sad day for you and your team, it’s a sad day for the sport and for everyone you’ve had an impact on."

Kyrgios also wished Murray well in the Australian Open, saying "I'll be behind you".
"I just want you to know, and I’m sure you already do, everyone wants you to keep fighting and to keep being you," he said.
Murray, a five-time Australian Open finalist and former world No.1, fought back tears and had to excuse himself to regain composure during a press conference in Melbourne on Friday, where he conceded he may not make it to Wimbeldon this year due to pain from a chronic hip injury.

"I'm not sure I'll be able to play through the pain for the next four to five months," the two-time Wimbledon champion told reporters.
"I can play with limitations. But having the limitations and the pain is not allowing me to enjoy competing or training ... Wimbledon is where I would like to stop playing but I am not certain I am able to do that."
Murray, whose world ranking has fallen to 230 following his injury woes of the past 18 months, struggled through a practice match with rival and current world No.1 Novak Djokovic at Margaret Court Arena on Thursday.
Earlier in the week, he posted a photo of himself next to the Australian Open trophy saying it was the closest he would ever get to it.

Stun Guns (View All)Stun Guns are one of the most popular self-defense products on the market today. Endorsed by police and rescue personnel across the country, they make for the perfect defense against a would-be attacker. Stun guns are easy to use, affordable, non-lethal and extremely effective at giving you or your loved one the opportunity to escape and alert authorities. Stun guns use a high-voltage, low-current electrical discharge to override the body’s superficial muscle-triggering mechanisms. As a result, the recipient is immobilized. The low-current is what makes it non-lethal. Generally, stun guns are about 2-3 mA, where 100 mA is lethal to humans. In addition to typical stun guns you may have seen on television and magazines, technology has advanced to create unique stun devices that look like cell phones, pens and even flashlights. Your attacker won’t even know what hit him! We offer one of the largest selections of stun guns by some of the biggest names, including Stun Master and ZAP. Before purchasing a stun gun, you should check the Stun Gun Laws and restrictions to make sure they are legal in your area.

Missing Malaysia Airlines plane: US issued warnings over Boeing 777s

MH370 vanished from radar, then flew for an hour
Confusion and disarray surrounds investigation
The US airline safety regulator warned last year of cracking in the fuselage skin underneath a Boeing 777’s satellite antenna, issuing a worldwide alert for the flaw to be fixed as it could lead to decompression that would leave occupants unconscious.
The problem identified by the US Federal Aviation Administration provides a possible explanation as to why a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane mysteriously went missing en route to Beijing on Saturday.
Malaysian authorities have expanded the search zone to include the Strait of Malacca.
A structural failure related to the flaw could not only have led to a slow decompression that left the 239 passengers and crew on the missing flight unconscious, it would also have disabled satellite communications, including the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits data of the plane’s location automatically.

It would also have rendered the plane invisible to all but 'primary radar', which has a range of only 100 nautical miles.
B777 antenna locations: the cracks were reported under the stacom antenna on top of the aircraft.
Malaysia authorities are now saying the missing Malaysia Airlines plane flew for one hour and 10 minutes after Malaysian aviation authorities saw it vanish from radar over the South China Sea and potentially travel off course.
According to a posting on the Professional Pilots Rumour Network, the end of satellite communications would not have disabled the mobile phone network on the plane, which runs off a different communications system.
Nineteen families signed a statement saying they were able to telephone the mobile phones on the plane. While they got a dial tone, no one picked up.
The posting theorises that a structural failure fitted with much of the information know so far about the disaster of Flight MH370.
The components of the satcom system shown in a Boeing training manual.
‘‘A slow decompression (e.g. from a golfball-sized hole) would have gradually impaired and confused the pilots before cabin altitude (pressure) warnings sounded,’’ it said.
‘‘If the decompression was slow enough, it’s possible the pilots did not realize to put on oxygen masks until it was too late. [It] also explains why another pilot thirty minutes ahead heard “mumbling” from MH370 pilots. (VHF comms would be unaffected by SATCOM equipment failure.).’’
The search continues for the missing plane. Credit:AP
The theory of how the incident may have unfolded is speculative, but the directive from the US Federal Aviation Administration is fact.
The 777-200 ER, the model operating flight MH370 was not specifically identified in the directive.

An inspection of a 14 year old Boeing 777 owned by an unnamed airline uncovered a 16-inch crack, the FAA found.
‘‘We propose to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 777 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracking in the fuselage skin underneath the satellite Communication (SATCOM) antenna adaptor.
‘‘This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the visible fuselage skin and doubler if installed, for cracking, corrosion, and any indication of contact of a certain fastener to a bonding jumper, and repair if necessary. We are proposing this AD to detect and correct cracking and corrosion in the fuselage skin, which could lead to rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity of the airplane.’’
The FAA directive called for additional checks to be incorporated into the routine maintenance schedule of the worldwide 777 Boeing fleet.
The flaw was first identified on June 12, 2013. Comment was sought from airlines and the manufacturer by November but the final airworthiness directive was not issued by the FAA until February 18.
According to a Malaysia Airlines spokesman, the missing aircraft was serviced on February 23, with further maintenance scheduled for June 19.
Whether the directive was picked up by the airline remains unknown.
A Boeing spokeswoman told Fairfax Media it was up to individual airlines to follow the directive, not the manufacturer.
Despite both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines having good safety records, there have been other incidents which could prove relevant during the investigation of the disappearance.
In 2005, a 777 operated by Malaysia Airlines suffered problems with its autopilot system on a flight between Perth and Kuala Lumpur.
It led to the plane pitching up into a sudden 3000-foot climb, almost causing the plane to stall.
The problem led to another airworthiness directive to correct a computer fault that had been found on 500 Boeing 777s.
Airworthiness directives are commonplace, similar to car recalls.
In the majority of cases, airlines are told to look for and correct the fault, if found, during maintenance.
While investigators from Malaysia and the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington search for the plane's black box, they will also be able to glean vital information from a live-data stream broadcast during the flight.
Known as Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, it is the equivalent of an "online black box".
However James Healy-Pratt, an aviation lawyer who has represented bereaved families in other air accidents, warned they face a long wait before the original black boxes are recovered.
A Boeing spokesman said it was working with the NTSB as a technical adviser.
"The team is now in position in the region to offer whatever assistance is required."

Nicolás Dujovne was named Argentina’s new treasury minister last month.
Since taking over as Argentina’s president a year ago, Mauricio Macri has implemented free-market measures in an effort to spur the economy and attract foreign investment. However, the country’s economy contracted for the fourth consecutive time in last year’s third quarter, and Macri in December dismissed his finance minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, and split his ministry of treasury and finance into two cabinet departments. What kinds of economic policies can be expected of new Treasury Minister Nicolás Dujovne and new Finance Minister Luis Caputo? What policies should the Macri administration push in order to restore the country to growth? To what extent will midterm legislative elections in October complicate efforts to reduce the country’s fiscal deficit and pass other needed reforms?
Daniel Filmus, Parlasur deputy, researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) and professor at the University of Buenos Aires: “Mauricio Macri’s economic policies have had serious consequences. All indicators show a negative trend. GDP has decreased, inflation was at its highest level in 15 years, the fiscal deficit increased sharply, external indebtedness grew, income distribution was regressive, thousands of companies shut down and so on. Foreign investments also did not arrive. Social indicators also accompanied this trend. Unemployment, poverty and indigence increased. Purchasing power fell, and the domestic market collapsed. Investment in key areas such as science and technology declined. All of this caused the fall of Alfonso Prat-Gay. However, in order to change this trend, just changing names isn’t sufficient. It is necessary to change policies. Nothing allows for this change. The government is continuing to bet on debt to sustain a fiscal deficit and the dynamism of sectors that have little impact on the real internal economy. In a world that will show more difficult economic conditions, the consequences are predictable. To make matters worse, this is a legislative election year, and efforts will be aimed at expanding the debt in order to sustain the deficit. This has already caused the resignation of the president of Banco de la Nación, Carlos Melconián. This will further complicate the economy’s future recovery. Reasonable policies that generate equilibrium and macroeconomic stability and at the same time support the growth of the domestic market, using credit as a lever for innovation, production and national industry as well as the recovery of consumption capacity and a progressive distribution of income seems to be the only way to reverse the present situation.”
Miguel Kiguel, executive director of EconViews in Buenos Aires: “The Macri administration during its first year concentrated its efforts on correcting the large distortions in relative prices, on resolving the default to restore access to international credit and on dismantling the systems of price and foreign exchange controls. In addition, the government took important steps to de-regulate the economy and improve the business climate. Despite these positive measures, this first year was difficult, as the economy suffered a deep recession and high rates of inflation. But these effects were largely anticipated, due to the ‘tough’ policy measures that the government put in place. Inflation has now receded and has dropped from around 4.5 percent per month in the first half of the year to around 1.5 percent. The biggest concern is growth, as the economy remained in recession at least until last November. In December, there was scattered evidence of a recovery, and there seen to be green shoots in agriculture and even in consumption. Will they develop or dry-up? Most likely, the economy this year will enjoy growth, mainly because the factors that led to the recession have been reversed: interest rates dropped, public works are on the rise, inflation has stabilized at lower rates and real wages are up. The recent changes in the cabinet do not signal a change in policies, they are intended to achieve better teamwork. Dujovne is an experienced economist with an excellent reputation and who is likely to closely monitor government expenditures, while Caputo is well-known for his ability to manage debt. All in all, Argentina is likely to maintain a friendly investment climate, and the economy is up for a year of growth and much lower inflation.”
Paula Alonso, associate professor of history and international affairs and director of the Latin American and Hemispheric Studies Program at The Elliott School of International Relations at The George Washington University: “Argentina has lifted capital controls, agreed with holdout bond investors, improved economic statistics and published a set of targets on inflation and fiscal deficits. A road-show announced Argentina is back, relations with the IMF have been normalized and the country will chair the G20 in 2018. However, the previous government left the Macri administration with a massive fiscal deficit and a myriad of microeconomic problems, distorting economic incentives. Fearing their impact on the economy and on social cohesion, progress has been relatively slow on these issues. The new treasury minister, Nicolás Dujovne, is a highly respected economist, a fiscal hawk and a budgetary expert who will try to further reduce spending by enhancing efficiency. Dujovne is helped by better-than-expected results from the recent tax moratorium, reducing the financing requirement for 2017. However, the government faces a tricky juggling act. It must issue around $10 billion of debt this year and must continue to bring inflation down and reduce the fiscal deficit. However, at the same time, it needs to attempt to boost growth in the face of headwinds, as growth still falters in Brazil, global interest rates rise and U.S. trade policy may become more restrictive. The outcome will affect the mid-term election in October. Indeed, one of Macri’s main political achievements in his first year has been his success in negotiating (with costly concessions) significant laws in a Congress where ‘Cambiemos’ only has 87 out 257 seats in the lower house and 15 out 72 in the Senate. He has also succeeded in establishing good relations with key provinces, including those in the hands of the opposition. The election will be a decisive political battle; it will not only define Macri’s power and the future of ‘Cambiemos,’ but it will also begin to define the leadership of the fragmented Peronist Party. The government is betting that the economic recovery will be strong enough at polling time”
Daniel Artana, chief economist at FIEL in Buenos Aires: “The new economic team should be more focused on achieving gradual improvement in the fiscal accounts. Last year, the government was able to comply with its target for the primary deficit, but with the help of one-off fines collected from the tax amnesty. The target for this year assumes an additional improvement of 0.6 percent of GDP. It would be a very positive signal if the new team achieved this fiscal target in a year of crucial mid-term elections, without using creative accounting. The economy will rebound in 2017. However, to consolidate medium-term growth, Argentina needs to increase investment and to raise productivity. The government is working slowly on reforms to improve productivity.”

In 50 years, the region near where I grew up, Cameron Parish in south-west Louisiana, will likely be no more. Or rather, it will exist, but it may be underwater, according to the newly published calculations of the Louisiana government. Coastal land loss is on the upswing, and with each hurricane that sweeps over the region, the timeline is picking up speed.
As a result, Cameron, the principal town in this 6,800-person parish (as counties are called in Louisiana), could be the first town in the US to be fully submerged by rising sea levels and flooding. So it’s here one would expect to feel the greatest sense of alarm over climate change and its consequences.
Instead, Cameron has earned a different kind of fame: it’s the county that, percentage-wise, voted more in favor of Trump than all but two other counties in the US in last year’s election. (Nearly 90% of registered voters did.)
Why would some of the people most vulnerable to climate change vote for a politician skeptical of climate change’s existence? Why would people in Cameron Parish support policies that could ruin them?
To get to the root of this question, I slipped my tennis shoes into knee-high marsh waders, navigated the ropes on a rusty shrimp boat, and ate mountains of fried seafood. I spoke to people living different and yet parallel lives in Cameron Parish, where timelines are defined as pre-storm or post-storm, and where people kindly addressed me as Miss Shannon.
In rocking chairs and over lunch specials, I asked them about their seemingly contradictory views. I asked them why they voted for Donald Trump. And I asked them how they felt about being the proud residents of what may be America’s first drowning town.
Tressie Smith: ‘If a hurricane comes, I’m screwed’

Tressie Smith is a 44-year-old mother of two and a business owner – her seafood restaurant is the most popular lunch spot in town.
That popularity is aided by the fact that her would-be competition was all destroyed in hurricanes Rita (2005) and Ike (2008). The population of Cameron dropped a stunning 79% between 2000 and 2010. When the hurricanes hit, Smith was working for a cafe down the road. When it closed after the storms, Smith saw an opening. She bought a barber shop, tacked up naval-themed decorations and named her new business Anchors Up Grill, a wry nod to the local conditions. Her special is the “dynamite shrimp poboy”, a sandwich with jumbo shrimp grilled in a spicy sauce and covered in melted cheese and bacon, for $11.
“Oh yeah, I’m concerned,” Smith says when asked about the future. “And the bad thing is they won’t give me any hurricane insurance. They said my building don’t qualify.”
Her structure, with its glass and metal garage and creaky wooden trailer steps, stands out among the remaining buildings on the street, which are mostly bunker-like big cement city offices. If another storm hit, Anchors Up looks like it’d be the first to go. “They did insure me the first year we were open, but then, for no reason, they wouldn’t renew it,” she recalls. “But this is all I can do, because I had to mortgage my house and my land to get this. Because of the rules and regulations, it costs so much to live here.”
Many locals in Cameron repeat this phrase – “rules and regulations”. They’re referring to the strict construction rules placed on residents who wanted to return to Cameron and rebuild after Rita and Ike hit the town. As a result, all structures needed to be raised in order to qualify for hurricane insurance. The result is a humble town whose homes appear strangely grandiose: single-story modest brick houses now rest on top of large, grassy man-made hills, a kind of south Louisiana castle.

For 10 years, Smith was a truck driver, which gave her a particular vantage point from which to observe the coast. “I think the coast is disappearing, I really do. Because I traveled this road so much, driving for the oil fields. By the way it looks, it looks like the water is getting closer and closer.”
But Smith stops short of offering an explanation. “I really don’t know what is causing it, I don’t know what you’d call it – erosion? I guess it’s probably caused by climate change, but I don’t really believe in the concept.” She pauses to sip her Coke, and reconsiders. She looks east down the road, where an $11bn- liquefied natural gas plant is slated to be constructed, once federal approval comes through. “But why would they be spending millions of dollars on those liquefied natural gas plants if the coast’s going to disappear? And they probably know a lot more than me.”
As for her politics, Smith thinks Cameron’s residents voted for Trump because “we think he could help the oil field out, and hopefully stop the imported seafood from coming into our country so our people can make a living,” she says.
Smith, like most of the residents of Cameron, has been highly dependent on state and federal assistance programs to recover after the storms. But what if, in Trump’s push to shrink the size of the government, recovery programs are cut?
“We’d be screwed,” she says frankly. “But that doesn’t change my opinion about Trump,” she quickly adds. “Outsiders think that everybody is just looking for a handout down here, but there is hard-working people that live here. There are just not many jobs right now, especially if all you know is commercial fishing. Even if Trump cuts those programs that helped us, we gonna make it one way or another here, with or without help. Down here we survive.”
Brandon Vail: ‘You can’t wait around for some bureaucrat to tell you what you can and can’t do’

Standing in green wading boots in shin-high water about 40 miles north of the Anchors Up Grill, Brandon Vail wipes the nitrogen pellets off of the inside of his glasses. A fertilizer plane has just passed over his rice field.
Vail is a young, highly educated self-employed rice farmer who makes about $35,000 a year from farming. He works on 4,500 acres of land – corn, crawfish, cattle, hay, soy beans and rice – which he leases from 22 different landowners. But the arable land around where Vail farms is disappearing, as development sprawls and coastal loss creeps northward.
“With the ground losses we have here, it doesn’t really pay to be really big for us. I do better to be diversified. I been losing ground to residential and commercial development, and also to mitigation land to make room for that. So over the last four years, I’ve lost about 1,000 acres. Some people have lost more.”
He’s not optimistic about the future of farming. “This year is my 19th crop. I probably picked a poor career choice because I can see the writing on the wall. If I had kids I wouldn’t want them doing what I’m doing in this area. I don’t think farming will be a viable industry in this area 50 years from now. I may be wrong. I hope I’m wrong.”
Vail is a registered Republican, and he gets heated when he thinks about how his fellow Trump voters are perceived from the outside.
“Everyone thinks just because you’re from the south you’re a Confederate flag-waving drunk idiot. We’re not all like that. Some of us are educated. We just see things different from you.” He added: “My parents busted their ass and cut corners for me to go to private school. My sister is a complete Democrat. We’re Catholic. But I’m looked at like some kind of racist slaveholder. I’m lumped into that category. But we don’t fit.”
Vail says he’s pleased with the drawdown on environmental restrictions that Trump has instituted since taking office.
“When he took office he stopped the EPA’s Waters of the US rule, where anything that would flow into a navigable tributary would have had jurisdiction under the EPA. Well, navigable tributaries go through half the land I farm. So you’re saying a ditch I put in my field to drain the water off, then that the land comes under your jurisdiction? You can tell me when I can go into it, and what I can use as fertilizer?”
He shakes his head in disgust. “Residents can go buy RoundUp, can send out their detergents and soaps and all this kind of runoff into downstream water, but then they want to blame the farmers?”
Vail adds: “There’s not a farmer on earth that is going to ruin soil or water. We learn best management practices, and most of us will use those practices because it increases the bottom line. You can’t wait around for some bureaucrat to tell you what you can and can’t do.”
Benny Welch: ‘If you go by what the real scientists say, there’s no proof’

“I’m gonna let you in on a little secret,” Mr Benny says, as he leans close enough that his worn white baseball cap shades the afternoon sun on my face. “I’m the luckiest man in the world.”
Seventysomething Benny Welch lives across from the oceanfront marsh in Cameron Parish, just behind a big oak tree, whose limbs he clung to through the night in 1957 when Hurricane Audrey hit, sweeping his family out of their home and him – fortuitously – into a wishbone-shaped crevice of branches, the only thing left standing when it was all over.
Mr Benny – as everyone refers to him here – spends his days strolling through a garage packed with boxes overflowing with severed alligator parts.
He and his family make their money hunting alligators, and then selling the otherwise discardable pieces of the alligator bodies – the styrofoam-like handles of perforated jawbone, the scaly claws with ladylike fingernails, the phallic-shaped teeth stained brown with age. The Welch family have done well for themselves thanks to a number of contracts with gas stations around the south, whose clients impulse purchase the alligator-tooth necklaces as they pay for their Big Gulps. He shows me one of the most popular pieces: an alligator tooth surrounded by rectangular beads stamped with the Confederate flag.
But business wasn’t always so good. The double-hit of hurricanes in 2005 and 2008 “turned the marshes upside down”, he recalls. “We didn’t know what what to do, there was no alligator eggs for three years.”
Mr Benny’s son lets me know that their alligator hunting business has brought in a high-end clientele. He brings out a photo of a grinning Donald Trump Jr taken during an alligator hunting trip. That personal connection has helped inform Mr Benny’s politics. “I’m Donald Trump all the way,” he says with a smile.
Even though Mr Benny’s family has been directly impacted by hurricanes, and even though the state mapping agency indicates that his home will be submerged within 50 years due to coastal land loss, Mr Benny isn’t buying it.
“I don’t believe it,” he says, shaking his head. “I don’t believe that the tide is gonna rise 10 feet and that the Ice Age is coming and stuff like that.” Like many of the residents here in Cameron, Mr Benny sees time on a longer horizon than others might. “I been here 75 years, you understand?,” he reminds me with gentle force. “And I’ve lived on the water and guess what? The tides still come up almost the same way, and there is no flooding. And today our front marshes aren’t underwater.”
“If you go by what the real scientists say, there’s no proof. In the last 10 years the average temperature of the world hasn’t even risen a half degree. And if you listen to everyone talking it, it’s up five or 10 degrees. And it’s not true! It’s a political thing. How much money has Al Gore made off global warming?,” he laughs, shaking his head with a cackle. “It ain’t happened yet!”
Bronwen Theriot: ‘I think the data is incomplete’

Bronwen Theriot is the 36-year-old science teacher at South Cameron High School. She’s also a member of a group colloquially called the “die-hards”: residents who had their homes destroyed by Hurricane Rita in 2005, managed to rebuild, and then had their new homes destroyed again in 2008 by Hurricane Ike. And still, she made it home. “I came back every time. To the same place,” says Theriot, proudly.
Theriot’s boyfriend works for the state, and so state policies on coastal subsidence are regular dinner conversation for the couple and their kids. “I’ve looked at those maps a million times,” she says, referring to the maps recently published by the state of Louisiana that show Cameron 50 years from today in the “red zone” – underwater. “I’ve looked at the aerial photos. I see how if we don’t do something to protect our coast we will have no coast to protect,” she says, matter-of-factly. “And it is evident if you take a ride around here.”
To the right of her home are a line of weed-bedraggled cement slabs, where her neighbors once lived; empty plots left by those driven away by the uninhabitability of this coast.
“From a scientific perspective,” she says, putting on her high school science teacher hat, “the map is showing you – look, this is going to happen. Compared to other places where they have stopped the erosion versus here where they haven’t, it’s clear that not enough is getting done.
“But I don’t know what is causing the coastal depletion,” she says. “When it comes to depletion and subsidence, I feel like there are so many items it could be attributed to, and perhaps it is not one individual thing, but a lot of things adding up.
“Do I think it is climate change? That’s hard,” she says, smiling. Theriot seems caught between her job as a science educator and her life as a longtime Cameron resident, tasked with teaching about the environment in a fiercely red town.
“From a scientific perspective ... data is manipulated all the time. So whoever is interpreting the data, as much as you try to not have a bias, you could still have a bias. Of course, I am going to be more proactive about coastal restoration and protections because it is directly affecting me, so for me, looking at the data, I am very very worried.” She relents: “But I think the data is incomplete. And I am still not sure about climate change. I am still researching it. I feel like I don’t have enough good sources to say yes or no on if climate change is a real thing.”
Now, from her elevated balcony overlooking the old slabs, she takes a clearer position. “I’m a big proponent of the oil industry, because that’s how my family and my community made a lot of its money. So that is my livelihood. So it is hard for me to point that finger.”
Leo Adley Dyson, Sr: ‘If I thought global warming was real, I’d be the first to admit it’

The Louisiana shrimping season just opened this week, and as a lifelong shrimper and the owner of a couple boats and a dock, today should be a busy day for Leo Dyson, not a slow one. But the wind’s been blowing too hard to take out the boats, and so here he sits, perched on a pile of barnacle-crusted wood pallets.
Dyson cares most about shrimp. “In these countries like China and everything, they work under communism where the government owns everything – the boats, the factories. In China, they raise their shrimp in sewage ponds they load with antibiotics, and that can cause cancer. We are one of the few countries that will even accept shrimp from China, and it doesn’t make sense that the FDA even allows that. But we gotta produce shrimp for the same price as them under free enterprise.”
“So I think Trump will help this. I think he will make changes to the FDA and import tariffs and all that. I think he will make a more even playing field where everybody will still be able to make a living. So I voted for him because I thought he was the best man for the job.”
Dyson is not particularly concerned about the forecasts that show the coast disappearing over the coming decades. He thinks global warming is a gossipy scam.
“Too bad you’re not writing for the National Enquirer,” he teases, “because then you could say ‘fisherman sleeps with alien and causes global warming!’
“The fact is I’m 68. I’ve seen cold weather and I’ve seen hot weather. And you know the earth’s been through some ice ages. And when the ice ages was over, did they think it was global warming? A planet that doesn’t change becomes a barren waste, so that’s why it’s changing.”
Instead, Dyson says that what worries him most are the environmental regulations ostensibly intended to save the coast. “The laws are already there to protect the coast. And I understand Trump is not 100% environmentalist. But I think it’s a good thing to get the government out of our lives. I don’t want any more environmental regulations. I don’t want any more fishing laws. And I don’t want a lot of restrictions where people can’t make a living.”
Dyson says hurricanes aren’t all bad news in his line of work. “The wetland restoration is doing more to harm the ecosystem than if they left it alone. After [hurricanes] Rita and Ike we caught a lot of shrimp, because the levees were washed away and nature worked the way it was intended to, where man didn’t mess with it. These structures – the levees and all – are making it get worse every year. So for me having a hurricane would be good for business – for a little while.
“If I thought global warming was real, I’d be the first to admit it,” he says, looking out across the rough water. “Because I’d be the first to see it. I’m here on the water after all. I could see how in 3,000 years we could be underwater, because I mean who knows, but in 50? I don’t think so. I was told that 50 years ago. Things don’t change much here.”
This article was amended on 28 August 2017. A previous version incorrectly identified Cameron Parish as the US county with the highest percentage of Trump voters in the 2016 presidential election.

Canada, France forge united front ahead of G7 summit with Trump as the U.S. president’s tweets grow strident
By Tonda MacCharlesOttawa Bureau
Bruce Campion-SmithOttawa Bureau
Thu., June 7, 2018
QUEBEC CITY—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s turn as host to a gaggle of the world’s most powerful leaders has turned into a diplomatic tapdance of epic proportions.
Key summit players acknowledged profound differences ahead of what promises to be an acrimonious face-off with U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 summit.
The prime minister was asked Thursday how leaders will negotiate with U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 summit, where disagreements on trade will be front and centre. Justin Trudeau says finding “common ground” is important. (The Canadian Press)
As the G7 leaders and more than a dozen other invited heads of government and key financial leaders arrived here under heavy grey skies, several hundred anti-globalization protestors took to Quebec streets.
French President Emmanuel Macron portrayed the other countries as bigger than the U.S. and the U.S. as not just truly embodied by its current leader.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, warned the tensions put at risk the G7’s ability to protect “the free world against those who disrespect our shared fundamental values: freedom and dignity of the individual, equal rights for people and nations and fair rules.”

Tensions were on display early.
Trudeau and Macron publicly staged a united front on climate change, trade and the deal to deter Iran’s nuclear proliferation. They denounced Trump’s trade tariffs on steel and aluminum as “unacceptable,” “counterproductive” and “ridiculous” in Trudeau’s words.
Trump shot back in response late Thursday on Twitter.
“Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.”
Trump followed up that tweet with a more personal shot at Trudeau, mocking him for “being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things … but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300 per cent on dairy — hurting our farmers, killing our agriculture!”

A senior Canadian government official who briefed reporters played down the impact of Trump‘s tweets on the tone of the coming talks. He repeated Trudeau’s insistence that the two leaders have often had frank discussions, and that’s what the G7 is for. “We’re not sugarcoating the fact there’ll be strong differences of opinion.”
Until Thursday, Trump’s attendance was in doubt, his reluctance framed as indifference and an unwillingness to be ganged up on.
Article Continued Below
Reporters pressed Trudeau and Macron, who have until now adopted a respectful and cordial approach to relations with Trump, if it was time to change tack, as they’d failed to persuade Trump to reverse course on trade. Macron shrugged off a question about whether Trump can or should be isolated, saying he would continue to work closely with the U.S. President.
“When you’re saying that President Trump doesn’t really care, perhaps that’s the case. But no one lives for ever,” Macron responded. “Our countries, the commitments we have made go beyond us.”
The French president said the group of like-minded leaders should not hesitate to speak their minds even at the expense of failing to reach a joint communiqué at the end of it all.”
“The six other countries of the G7 — that’s a market that is bigger than the American market,” said Macron. “So we must look it in the eye,” he said, launching an impassioned defence of multilateralism.
Trudeau said the two-day G7 gathering is a chance for more “frank” discussions. He acknowledged that questions swirl about the “dynamic” at the summit, but said frank discussions are its very purpose.
On Thursday evening Trudeau met with Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker who that day highlighted the G7’s existential angst in a column for The New York Times.
Tusk said the “crucial question” on everyone’s mind is whether Trump’s tariff moves “are only incidental changes to current American policy (to which, of course, every president is entitled) or the beginning of a new strategic trend.”
“Simply put: Are they merely seasonal turbulences or rather the first symptoms of the breakup of the Western political community, which the G-7 represents and informally leads?”
Tusk defended the value of the G7, saying “our community cannot be blown apart by aluminum tariffs.” But he added, “it’s clear that something may have changed.”
“Europe should, in a way, be grateful to President Trump. His decisions have made us realize that we need to depend on one another,” Tusk said.
Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Trump in Washington before both arrive here Friday, with an eye to shaping the U.S. President’s approach to North Korea.
Trump heads straight to the June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore when the G7 ends Saturday.
Abe went to great lengths to portray himself as an ally of Trump, stressing the two were perfectly aligned on how to deal with the North Korean leader.
However, Abe, too, is deeply concerned about Trump’s tariffs which have hit Japan as well.
John Kirton, head of the University of Toronto’s G7 research group, said if this summit ends without a final joint communiqué, it will have been the first time in the 43-year history of this particular gathering that the leaders failed to land on an agreed statement.
It wouldn’t, of itself, constitute a failure, said Kirton, but Trudeau is at risk of a diplomatic failure if he attempts to portray a consensus where the U.S. would happy to point out there was none.

'WHITE PRIVILEGE'
US university launches new course teaching staff ‘how to deal with being white’
The "Conversations on Whiteness" was designed to teach them "how to fight for social justice"

THE University of Michigan offers its employees a two-day course aimed at helping them deal with their "whiteness".
The "Conversations on Whiteness" conference is reportedly designed to teach them how to "fight for social justice causes".

The University of Michigan held a conference for employees to help them "deal with being white"
Its December 5 meeting was created to help attendees "unpack whiteness', according to a post on the university's website seen by the College Fix.
Those who attended the session were taught to "recognise the difficulties they face when talking about social justice issues related to their White identity, explore this discomfort, and devise ways to work through it".
It was based around the "White Privilege Exploration" (PIE) model created by University of Iowa professor Sherry Watt.
She highlighted "defences" people use to ignore their privilege including "denial", where they refuse to accept they are, and "minimisation", when they do not realise the impact it has.

The PIE model also groups heterosexual, male and able-bodied people in the "privileged identities" category.
In 2016, the University of Vermont held a three-day retreat "specifically for white people", where they could talk about privilege in a safe environment.
Those attending the "White Identity Retreat" would be taught to 'recognize and understand white privilege from an individual experience", the university stated.
The free program was hosted by the university's African, Latino, Asian, Native American and Bi/Multiracial Student Center (ALNA).

The organisation said students would be given guidance on 'the impact of white privilege on the University of Vermont community and beyond".
The same year, more than 1,000 students travelled to Philadelphia for a "White Privilege Conference" aimed at "dismantling white supremacy".
Oregon State University has also held a number of 'Social Justice Retreats' aimed at promoting "campus dialogue about race and racism".

US and China, Trade Issues Still Drawing Concerns
Asian stocks inched higher to one-month highs on Friday, after comments from the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
HONG KONG, HONG KONG, HONG KONG, January 11, 2019 /EINPresswire.com/ — But the rally's momentum slowed partly as investors sought more clarity on whether the United States and China could make headway on their talks on trade as well as intellectual property (IP) rights. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier on Thursday said that Washington was having "tremendous success" in its trade negotiations with China.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged 0.2 percent higher, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei advanced 1.1 percent in early trade.
Wall Street extended its rally into a fifth straight day on Thursday in a whipsaw trading session as investors responded to mixed comments by Powell, while a warning from Macy's pummeled retail stocks.
At the Economic Club of Washington, Powell reiterated the views of other policymakers that the Fed would be patient about interest rate hikes.
Major U.S. stock indexes also quickly recovered from brief losses after Powell said that the Fed's balance sheet would be "substantially smaller".
"The word 'patient' is used often when the Fed's policy direction is still tightening but its next rate hike can wait for a considerable time. So risk assets now enjoy support from what we can call Powell put," said William Cheung, economist at Altrice Investment Co. Limited.
"Similarly, Trump also softened his stance on China after sharp falls in stock prices. He has offered an olive branch to China and there's no reason China would not want to accept it," he said.
U.S. and Chinese officials are working on arrangements for higher-level trade talks after mid-level officials this week discussed U.S. demands on issues that would require structural change in China to address issues such as IP theft, forced technology transfers and other non-tariff barriers.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late on Thursday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will "most likely" visit Washington later in January for trade talks.
In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar rebounded after hitting three-month lows against major currencies.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six of its peers, rallied from its three-month low, after the Powell comments.
The euro last traded at $1.1515, while the dollar fetched 108.39 yen.
U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and in reaction to Powell's comments on the Fed "substantially" reducing the size of its balance sheet.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield last stood at 2.737 percent.
Crude prices held near one-month highs, but a more than week-long in oil rally slowed as optimism surrounding
U.S.-China trade talks faded a little.
In early Asian trade, West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) slipped 0.7 percent to $52.23 per barrel.

How Will Autonomous Vehicles Help People with Disabilities?
Posted on November 9, 2016 by Troutman & Troutman
It has been 16 years since an accident left Sam Schmidt paralyzed from the neck down. Before that, he was a race car driver who competed all over the country. However, an accident ended his racing career. That accident also stopped him from ever driving to the supermarket, or travelling on his own, but a one-of-a-kind license is changing that.
How are Autonomous Vehicles Going to Help People with Disabilities?
Schmidt’s license is unique in our country, and it has several restrictions. The foremost restriction on his license says that the vehicle he drives must be autonomous. Luckily for Sam, there are a few self-driving vehicles out there now-a-days. Most major automotive manufacturers and a few tech companies are creating cars that can drive themselves. A company called Arrow created Schmidt’s autonomous 2016 Corvette Z06, and Tesla and Google have their own consumer vehicles in the works. These cars will allow anyone to get behind the wheel and drive to wherever they need to go, and people in the disability community are getting excited.
Many people with disabilities are quite familiar with the limitations of today’s transportation. Most can’t even take a trip to the supermarket without hours of preplanning, but autonomous vehicles can change that. One wheelchair accessible van could take a person across town with just the push of a button. Plus, if the vehicle is autonomous enough, they wouldn’t be required to have a license to operate it.
Sam Schmidt’s Corvette has cameras and computers that steer based on Sam’s head movements—he controls the throttle and braking by breathing into a tube. That means Sam’s car is only semi-autonomous. It even has pedals and a steering wheel on the passenger side so a backup driver can take over if something goes wrong. However, many companies are developing systems that don’t need that kind of input from a human driver, and it’s those machines that we could start seeing on the roads in the next five to ten years.
Are you excited by the prospect of autonomous vehicles? What other features do think these cars should have? Tell us what you think on Twitter and Facebook, and keep checking in with your Tulsa disability attorneys right here on our blog.

90.5 WESA's "The Confluence" for Friday, Dec. 29, 2017
It’s been a eventful news year in the Steel City, from hospital booms to repeated flush and boil orders to President Trump's impact on Pennsylvania.
Where have policies and politics divided us? How will new infrastructure and transportation plans affect us in 2018? And where will the fallout from revelations of sexual assault and harassment leave us next year?
90.5 WESA's Kevin Gavin discusses all this in a special two-hour edition of The Confluence looking back at the year's biggest headlines from across the Pittsburgh region.
Joining this week:
Rebecca Addison, news editor at Pittsburgh City Paper
Jeremy Boren, digital managing editor for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review
Kim Lyons, freelance reporter
Brentin Mock, reporter for CityLab
Chris Potter, reporter at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Halle Stockton, managing editor for PublicSource
Mike Wereschagin, freelancer and investigative reporter for The Caucus

Connecticut Supreme Court Affirms Appellate Court Decision Reversing a $6.2 Million Judgment
On January 17, 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court issued an important decision on governmental immunity for Connecticut municipalities. In Ventura v. Town of East Haven, an appeal handled for the Town by Aaron Bayer and Tadhg Dooley of Wiggin and Dana, LLP, the Supreme Court affirmed an Appellate Court decision reversing a $6.2 million judgment against East Haven. The judgment was based on a police officer's failure to tow a vehicle that had invalid registration and the wrong license plates. That vehicle subsequently struck the plaintiff, causing him serious injuries. The trial court had held that the Town was not protected by governmental immunity, because the police officer had a “ministerial duty” to tow the vehicle based on police department towing rules. A jury awarded the plaintiff $12.2 million, which was later reduced to $6.2 million. In reversing, the Appellate Court held that the towing rules did not impose a ministerial duty on police officers and the Town was therefore entitled to governmental immunity.

NASA tries to recreate life (abiogenesis)
All scientists, no matter how smart or well educate, never create life that walks out of that jar. All they create is a reason to be in denial of God. The problems of actually create life remain the same. They have to remove oxygen to do this. The problem is, without oxygen you cannot make rain that rains on the rocks and creates the primordial soup.
They would have to change the laws of physics and chemistry because H2O is how you make water. No O aka oxygen and you get nothing. Why remove the oxygen? Because when the supposed amino acid come together tho start the creation of life process, oxygen becomes that newly formed life’s enemy because oxygen break the DNA down.
Evolutionists claim that abiogenesis has nothing to do with evolution. but if you break down what has to happen for life to form it’s proven otherwise. Non-living matter becoming alive is a biological change process that matter has to go through to become living. Which is one of the very definitions of evolution. Let’s not forget the *name* of Darwin’s book..,.
Origin of Species aka the Origin of all Life. So yes Darwin even agrees. But the main reason evolutionists deny abiogenesis being a part of evolution is because it exposes the truth about evolution and that is that it fails before it even gets started.
Evolution, since it’s conception, has always been about removing God from the equation. Why? Because atheists need a reason to deny God. This is the reason they used evolution to remove God from our public schools. Those who helped Darwin agree with this as their comments on the issue are recorded in history.
When all the amino acids are created in the lab, the one problem they never mention is that they only created a little over 80% of the amino acids needed to create life. Not all amino acids occur naturally in nature. So when the experiment is done to the near fashion of looking like what would happen in nature, in the results, they never show you a check off list of what needs to be created to create life aka hiding the truth. So they need to come up with 20% more amino acids but no matter how many times they repeat this, they never get closer. So nothing new here.
This is why the idea called Pamspermia has been thought up. It’s the idea that we were either seeded here by aliens, or our DNA and Amino Acids arrived here from another planet that had life. As if what cannot happen here naturally occurred somewhere else. Or that it took intelligent beings (aliens), just not God.
The fact of the matter is, is that without God science always falls short of creating life from lifeless matter and always will.
Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and *breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul*
God on purpose, made this a *supernatural event* so that those who do not believe will have no excuse not to believe. Man cannot recreate this supernatural event. For if man could do it then God is not God. Understand? Do you have the breath of life? And that’s why you’ll never create life from non-living matter, ever.
There used to be a time when aliens and spaceships were tin foil hat time. Today it’s now science and you are considered scientific if you accept that. So crazy went to being smart without any evidence that can be tested using the scientific method all because atheists are desperate to have an excuse to always deny God.
So if creation is true and evolution is a lie, why does God allow evolution to exist?
Easy, in the Bible it called sifting the wheat from the chaff. Freewill means that you have a choice. So God gives that choice just like in the garden with Adam and Eve. The choice exists because during judgment you can never claim you were forced to do anything. Which makes you responsible for all that you do.
Some memes you can use to debate with.

Dunedin’s non-student problem
Dunedin students have copped a lot of flak over the years for couch burning, rioting and general mayhem and alcohol abuse.
There’s no doubt that a minority of students cause trouble – I think first year students in their first year away from home and old enough to buy alcohol will always be a bit of a problem.
But some of the problems are not students. Non students from Dunedin and also from provincial towns are known to be attracted to scarfyville to stir up mischief, burgle, and assault, and confront authorities.
There is another example of this in the court news this week.
Stuff: Police arrest two teens after Dunedin student quarter assaults
A pair of Dunedin men have been arrested for the alleged assault of two students in Dunedin’s student quarter.
The men, aged 19, were arrested last week, following two assaults on Hyde St on February 18.
The notorious Hyde Street.
Both men were non-students, with one remanded in custody and the other on strict bail conditions, Detective Sergeant Chris Henderson said.
Police were continuing to investigate two other assaults from the same night, which happened on Castle St and Dundas St.
Students come to Dunedin to further their education, and most also try to have some fun while they are here. A few do stupid and sometimes illegal things.
Local low-lifes take advantage of the concentration of young people and the social events that take place.
Most people in Dunedin courts are not students.

I remember a situation in Dunedin a couple of years ago making sensational headlines which invited, and got, all the anti-student rhetoric and prejudices.
The arrested ones got to court and ‘ullo, ‘ullo, no students.
