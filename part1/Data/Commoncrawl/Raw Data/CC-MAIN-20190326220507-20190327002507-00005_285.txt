It’s Tim Ferriss’s most soulful interview yet: Jack Kornfield, a guru who talks the talk, walks the walk, sat the sit. With a great selection in the shownotes of links and people mentioned.
As these two leaders discuss morning practices, I’m struck by how many of the perspectives and attitudes they hope for are nicely handled by the Jewish morning prayers.

A 21-year Finnish study (not that they’re biased) has concluded that the sauna is great for middle-aged men’s health, the UK Daily Mail reports. Among 2,315 men aged 42 to 60 from eastern Finland, a sauna 2–3 times per week was associated with a 24% lower risk of death and 4–7 times per week with a 40% lower risk!

How great to see some persuasive pundit prophecy: At the Bar-Ilan University’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, Jordan-born translator Abe Haak argues that the Palestinian Authority’s collapse is coming and in the ensuing violent anarchy Palestinians will rush to safe haven with friends in family in Jordan — and soon enough Jordan will instead come to them.
A Jordanian return to the population centers of the West Bank may seem merely wishful thinking, though it does seem to me the most likely long-term scenario (though perhaps will remain so indefinitely). By holding Area C and being patient for two generations Israel will have widened its narrow waist to a more defensible size without having to swallow a couple of million hostile people; shame Israel and Jordan couldn’t have come to such an arrangement during the aftermath of the Six Day War.

The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success
Albert-László Barabási

This book seems like one for our times: a self-improvement topic given fresh life by being supported by social science data. There are sufficient surprising results — similar to say Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow — to warrant reading, despite, when stepping back and taking it on the whole, the thing feeling largely self-evident. But it is not, and probably deserves a reread.

Facts on Aging
Per Sherrie Mcgregor, Ph.D. (PsychCentral), exercise programs do generally produce improvements, often dramatic ones, even among very elderly participants. For example, one researcher reported that 80-year olds and 90-year olds who had completed a 10-week strength-training program showed more than a 100 percent increase in their strength, and significant increases in their walking speed and stair climbing ability.

Real Women who count.
Hilary Butler - Monday, January 23, 2017
Sydney Elizabeth Parkin
Born 8 August 1879
Died 5 November 1955
While watching the “pink” marches, my thoughts turned back to my grandmother. A real woman. Fiercely independent; well educated, who had the backbone and the guts to do the unthinkable. First she married my grandfather, but to get to him, traveled through Russia (trans-Siberian rail) on her own – something no “young lady” would do.
Sydney married Harold, whose work took him into many Asian countries where danger abounded. When they lived in India, a typhoid epidemic raged for seven years, and for the four years they lived there, Sydney nursed the sick locals, teaching them how to survive typhoid. Every country she lived in, she nursed the supposedly fatally-sick, and developed a reputation. No-one nursed by Sydney died. In their last year in India, Sydney got typhoid along with three children, and the locals abandoned her. She was too sick to nurse herself or her children properly. She survived, though her hair changed colour, and two of the three sick children died.
In July 1911, six months pregnant with my father, Sydney took a passenger ship from Amoy in China to Kobe in Japan, sailing ahead of her husband and children, to prepare their home-to-be. Near Kobe, the ship was over-run by pirates. The pirates killed the men, and launched all the small boats without oars into the water with two women in each. One woman was shot dead in each boat, then the boats cut adrift.
Sydney survived along with a few of the other women. When her husband arrived, the law enforcement in Japan rolled their eyes and said, “Nothing doing”. China just laughed. Sydney and Harold tracked down the pirates, they were brought back to Japan, tried, and executed. I suppose the snowflakes would consider these photos to be cruel….
The First World War intervened, and the ship taking them home was diverted to New Zealand,
so they made the best of it, and decided to travel up to Northland via the coast. In doing so, they got caught in a storm, were pretty much shipwrecked, and landed up on Kawau Island, where they licked their wounds, just as the Spanish Flu arrived in force.
Sydney turned Governor Grey’s house into a hospital with the men upstairs and the women downstairs.
For months, she and the kitchen maid nursed everyone on the island, and yet again, not one person died. Only two people on Kawau Island didn’t get the Spanish flu. My grandmother, and the kitchen maid.
This was the woman who brought up my father. No surprises, but I learned two things at home. There are two words that don’t apply. “Can’t” and “Never”.
Strong women grow strong children. Strong women know who they are, what they are here for, and they make the very best of every opportunity handed to them. Strong women are not doormats. Strong women keep men accountable. Strong women make their own choices, they speak, and are heard. They work, and they control their own lives; defend themselves when they need to, and nothing stops them doing what needs to be done. They teach "pussy grabbers" manners, and put them in their place, without drama. Unless of course, they perpetuate it because they want it and seek it out… THEN they are part of the problem.
Ironically, coming to New Zealand in 1961, turned out to be a huge challenge for me, but the bullying and viciousness of my peers, had the same effect on me as the hardships of Asia had on Sydney.
It gave me a backbone built on discernment, control, knowledge, learning wisdom, resoluteness, and never backing down in the face of injustice.
I’ve spent the last 35+ years, helping others to do the same thing, in diverse situations. Real women change the world. They stand strong in who they are, become knowledgeable and astute, and see the female flake a mile off.
As I watched the marches yesterday, three things came through loud and clear…. First, they don't know how lucky they are, second, they have no idea what oppression really is and third, away from their handlers and emboldened by the mob mania, most of these people haven’t a clue what really matters. If they did, they would have focused on protesting about real issues for women in the world ..., instead of sounding like ignorant asses. What they said shows their ignorance,
and what they left behind proves that they don’t care,
and are just in it for the moment… the media …. or… is it for the money?

The Seduction of Satire.
Hilary Butler - Sunday, January 22, 2017
The Onion, which calls itself “America’s finest news source”, filled space with another vitriol variant on Mike Pence today. “What Hilary? You don’t like satire? It’s just words Hilary. Humour makes the world go around didn’t you know?”
What I know is that death and life are in the power of words, and those who love words, will eat the fruit of them, and by their fruits you will know them.
Satire isn’t humour. Satire is writing lying words as if they are coming from another person’s mouth. Satire is written from a veneer of hatred, and its purpose is to shame and humiliate. It’s also a subtle variant of public fear mongering. Hidden beneath the cloak of people’s laughter, satire is designed to plant into people’s minds perceptions about people which are a stereotype, assumed, or even fabricated.
Oh, we’ve all heard those words, “Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can never hurt you.” Never was a bigger lie written than that one. Words are seeds, which are planted and grow.
Words have started wars which have killed millions of innocent front-line soldiers on both sides, because someone took offense to words. Historians who know the effects of words, will know which words were spoken, that so riled Hitler, that he decided to take matters into his own hands, giving us the holocaust and World War II.
But did the people who spoke those words which resulted in shame and humiliation for a country after World War I, ever dream that those words would become the fuel which would set fire to Europe as the Second World War, and also result in ethnic cleansing?
But back to Trump.
Is satire funny to those who are at the butt end of it? Those who are crying in their beards about Donald Trump being president should perhaps consider the impact that satire can have, particularly when it’s done publicly, deliberately, and cynically.
America is now eating the FRUIT of the words spoken by President Obama who chose to use satire to relentlessly humiliate and shame Donald Trump in front of the nation.
America can also thank the previous and ONGOING serial lying out of the mouths of the main stream media, for the election of Trump, by people who saw the previous satire and the lies for what they were.
Listening must be followed by analysis, then a choice. Believe it, or not. Then comes the action.
I see the outcome of voices, choices and consequences whenever parents come to me with a vaccine-damaged child. The story is always the same, every time. Parents listened to lies, believed the lies, and never bothered to read the vaccine data sheets in the doctors’ hands, which usually detail exactly the problems their children now have. They made a choice based on trusting a doctor, believing the lies, which resulted in the damage to their child.
The system of course, calls the vaccine damage “coincidence”, then labels the parents “anti-vaccine” idiots, and throws them off the cliff.
The parents then become angry at the system for lying in the first place, lying again, and then leaving the parents to pick up the mess that resulted from them believing the system’s lies in the first place.
After the lies, damned lies and statistics used by the pro-vaccine zealots, SATIRE mixed with as much dripping sarcasm as possible, (which amounts to character and intelligence assassination) is considered by the pro-vaccine to be the best way to sow all the propaganda you can imagine into the minds of parents who are thinking about vaccines. “Oh, but anti-anti-vaccine satire is only humour, Hilary!”
Dream on.
This last year has been a revelation to me. We can’t complain we live in boring times. It’s like the curtains have been pulled back to reveal the many faces of deception and mind manipulation everywhere.
Hopefully, those with eyes to see, will take note, and understand, because the satire and lies on all fronts, are the ways of the world, and part of a universal, well-orchestrated escalating campaign.
Those who know the truth, also know that evil communications – or as some would say – bad company - corrupts good manners. The words you listen to and believe, have a defined outcome. The words you speak can result in consequences.... ... Continue Reading
Rocking the boat
Hilary Butler - Saturday, November 12, 2016
I’m astounded at how many Americans say, “Shut up Hilary, you haven’t got a dog in this race.” I'm also astonished at the number of American people who think that because I have plenty to say about the American elections on Facebook, that I'm pro-Trump.
Where does anyone get that dork idea from? If I had to pick a worthy candidate to vote for, to clear the Washington swamp from bottom up, it would be Trey Gowdy. “Oh” but you say, “ . . . he wasn't on the ballot.” No. “Oh” but you say, “ . . . the popular vote went to Hillary Clinton.” Right. It went to Al Gore (and others) in the past, as well.
You know the system. You vote (or not) by the rules you have. Same as us. And when a decision is made, the losers have to suck it up and not behave like whining babies or make the situation worse. As to the Soros funded rioters,…. so much for all the predictions that Trump's supporters would be the bad losers! And what about the " When they go low, we will take the high way!" Michelle Obama directive?
Have you no idea what you just escaped from?
Wake Up America. You didn’t just dodge a bullet, you dodged a Clinton neutron bomb. Do you not remember 1992? Of course not. Some of you weren’t even born then and obviously didn’t think to check the history.
Oh yes, the critics and naysayers (who just sit around spouting hot air) are now saying, “I didn’t vote. Elections are a mirage, and if they mattered they wouldn’t be legal” or “But Trump will bring the environmental desecration that exists in China and India here, with his anti-climate change policies!!”
Well first up, if you didn’t vote you have no right to complain, because you benefit every day from the system, or people who work with the system that you criticise. You have to live under that administration. Doing nothing will get you nowhere. Whining will get you worse than nowhere.
If you are really concerned about the environmental future, look at what YOU OWN. How many of the things that you have bought are made in China? Why haven’t you been buying “Made in the USA”?
Oh right. Because… most of your industries were relocated to China, because you – the people - wanted everything cheaper. And…. because your manufacturers just wanted to push environmental degradation on to China and keep fresher air for themselves. And if you bought into that? That’s hypocrisy.
Do you think Trump wants to repeat the mistakes of a regime in China which has a moral deficit the size of a sucking black hole? Do you think that Trump wants to love a country that he is about to environmentally shit in, industry wise and ecologically?
Do you think Trump is totally dumb?
Or are you just trailing along behind the ….
To those who would rather I shut up because I'm not American, or because it's none of my business because it doesn't affect me, -- it does, so here is my reply to the ongoing criticism from afar:
I have more than one dog in this race. All my dogs are in this race. I went to the USA twice during the Clinton years and watched with disgust as Hillary Clinton excoriated your ‘health care’ system and was the driver behind mandatory vaccines, and supported "Every child by two" and supported removing vaccine exemptions. Had she got in this time, it would have been curtains for any parental (and eventually adult) vaccine choice.
More than that, I've spent my life dealing with the fall-out of vaccines and seen how they destroy life at ground zero. So I know that in order for people to really have freedom, they need both control and choice at a ground zero level. Freedom to choose is something that Hillary Clinton only wanted in areas where it didn't really matter for her politics. Where it really mattered, her rule has always been, “My way or the by-way.” She has never believed in family control, and firmly believes that no children should go to any other school than a state mandated one. She thinks all children should be in daycare and that the state appointed “experts” should make all decisions on behalf of all children.
How does this election affect me?
The influence of the USA goes far beyond its hundreds of military bases, its interference in other countries or use of drones, or when the USA’s politicians try to force other countries to comply with "policies". The term "global powerhouse" is not without foundation.
I've spent my married life working for families in USA, here in NZ, and elsewhere. Those families have been torn apart as a direct result of USA's 1986 vaccine legislation, which has impacted every country in the world. That legislation is solely responsible for the huge increase in vaccines world wide, because what the CDC does, the rest of the world follows.
In New Zealand, girls are being injured and crippled by Gardasil at a huge rate, all because of a 1986 piece of American legislation that President Reagan was against, didn't want to sign into law, which a certain parent group campaigned for, and basically mounted public pressure to force President Reagan to agree to. He didn't want to, but was forced to. If that legislation had never been enacted, we wouldn't have Gardasil today, or any other of the long list that has been added from that time and are waiting in the wings to be added in the future. If that legislation hadn’t been passed we wouldn’t be facing the ever-creeping invasion of adult vaccines, which the industry will also try to have mandated through government policies.
Vaccines cut to the heart of individual freedoms and choices, for every individual. When I was in the USA during the Clinton era, I watched Hillary Clinton like a hawk, because compulsory vaccination, no exemptions, and "Every child by two" were her babies.
Make no mistake. Hillary’s 2016 agenda for children was far reaching. It looked benevolent and was understated. Believe that at your peril.
The direct actions of the Clinton family and American people who couldn't see beyond their pockets, continues to affect New Zealand and the rest of the world.
The American vaccine manufacturers lobbied Governments worldwide, and licensing medical authorities were delighted that suing vaccine manufacturers had become impossible. Of course all the shareholders and “stake-holders” got on the bandwagon and new vaccines were developed to become the new El Dorado with 1998 headlines like, “Drug companies revel in heady time of unrivalled prosperity” (NZ Herald Wednesday July 22) and “The Vaccine Business Gets a Shot in the Arm” (Wall Street Journal, February 25, 1998.)
The Wall street journal article was straight to the point in saying, “The climate slowly began to change again in 1986, after passage of a federal law that shields vaccine producers from all liability not relating to manufacturing error. … this law “turned the industry around” and encouraged biotech companies to jump into the vaccine field, says Mr Williams of Pasteur Merieux Connaught”
My life which has been spent trying to help people directly affected by the original decisions of American leaders in 1986, who thought controlling everyone was the right thing to do, and if Hillary Clinton was your new President, the recipe would be more mandates, no exemptions, and parents be damned.
So yeah, I think I have more than one dog in the vaccine discussion as to why a Hillary Clinton presidency would have been a disaster for me as a New Zealander, and for the rest of the world too.
What will the Trump presidency bring? History will be the judge. But whatever your view on the issue, Hillary Clinton got one thing right in her concession speech, even though she means it differently to how I took it. We should never stop fighting for the things that are worth achieving, and at the core of that, is the freedom to make informed choices about anything to do with our bodies, our faith, our education options and our family lives.
Lose that, and nothing else matters. Continue Reading

You show us pictures of the connected babies, and say that these pictures were taken in Amsterdam, Holland where the family had a child nurse 8 hours a day teaching her parents how to respond to her needs and how to organise their home. Of course. Parents are dumb, right?
What you neglect to say is that the Holland scheme is an OPT IN scheme, which offers a raft of other programmes which the NZ parliament would never agree to, but are far more valuable than the "8-day care.
I know people in Holland, and asked them about this service. Yes, it's there if mothers want it, but most thinking parents usually part way with this system within 48 hours because their advice can be laughable. And frankly, most parents don't need to be taught how to organise their houses or lives, and neither do they need to be taught how to respond to their child's needs. However, one thing Dutch parents don't like, is the huge emphasis that all mother must be back at work when their babies are 1 year old. They tell me lots of stories of distraught stressed babies basically torn away from parents, who do not cope with that separation.
Are you wanting that too Johan?
Then as if 8 hours a day for a week has any relevance, . . . as if Northern Europe is some utopia to show up New Zealand's failure, you say, "A country like Holland is closing it's prisons, at a time when New Zealand is building them."
Such a remarkable assumption.
Simple as that?
Did you only read the first bit of this article Johan? Err...isn't that called cherry-picking?
Because if you did, then you missed these bits.
" However one Dutch MP Nine Kooiman, told Telegraaf newspaper: “If the government really worked at catching criminals, we would not have this problem of empty cells.”
Frans Carbo, head of FNV, said there was another story. “The ministry puts everything down to a decrease in crime in the Netherlands, partly related to the ageing population,” he said. “Actually, the ministry of security and justice is already cutting back and reorganising the whole chain. This starts with police, where reorganisation is failing, so they are not as good at detection and a lower percentage of crime is solved than ever before…"
So maybe, it's not quite so simple. Shame about the police force losing it's crime solving ability. Even though Holland is a big brother state which tracks its citizens on data bases which you apparently envy, the Netherlands is also, in other regards, a very permissive and liberal society which allows many things in society, which would land New Zealanders in jail. In Europe, women had much more political input, and jail policies have long been very different to our. While one jail might have been made into a tourist hotel, in others, business is booming as those prisons contract to take prisoners surrounding countries that still have a compentent police force.
The declining numbers of Dutch prisoners in Dutch prisons, might have nothing at all to do with eight days of a state mandated nurse giving state-mandated sound bites. It might be that definitions of crime are different, sentencing policies are different and rehabilitation more successful. But it also might have everything to do with the ability of a new IT breed of more intelligent, totally cyber-savvy criminals who now easily outwit the police.
Criminals, all over the world, are turning to cyber crime, because the tools are now there to do it so easily, and not get caught doing in-the-flesh crime.
But the rhetoric fits your clarion call, because your ideas are basically all based on more money for your systems:
•	Big Brother: community child health services are seriously underdone.
•	Big Brother: antenatal education is almost unavailable to those families that need it most.
•	Big Brother: we don't have the midwives, child health nurses, social workers to identify and support the families that need it.
•	Bigger Brothers united: all our services need to work really well together.
•	More money for Big Brother: We need to throw more money at the issues.
•	Big Brother prohibition: reduce access to alcohol, cut methamphetamines off at the border is critical. (as if prohibition ever worked, right? who exactly runs the NZ meth factories Johan?)
•	Big Brother: sorting poverty in New Zealand's increasing gap between rich and poor is critical.
(Read your own history Johan... start with Macleans 1964 book ("Challenge for Health, a History of Public Health in New Zealand), and consider just what has REALLY made the biggest improvements in the past.
•	Big Brother: sorting housing is critical.
•	Big Brother. Children's ministry with aspiration and responsibility to sort this.
•	Big Brother: children's minister to be front bench minister of finance.
•	Big Brother: Treasury can help to sort this.
•	Big Brother: Banks and corporations legislated to "give back" to a country and the communities that they benefit from.
According to my analysis , neither the banks or corporations benefit from the marginalised community group who, according to you, have nothing to spent and no homes to live in. Perhaps the money grabbing legislation should be directed at the drug smugglers, the millions of forced "entitled family" payments to Samoa/Tonga - and other "elements" who leach the money and soul out of these groups?
Perhaps you should just say it as it really is: You expect the law-abiding, hard working taxpayers who responsibly look after their own families, to be doubly taxed so as to pick up the tab for all those who can't, or won't. That's what it amounts to, because you know full well that corporations and banks, simply pass the costs on, and their profits never blip.
Neither is there any recognition of the responsibility of previous generations of families of these parents who don't make the grade, to have an active part in solving the problems they created. Where are they held accountable or being "educated" in all this?
•	Big Brother: Can we have a plan - a 10-yr plan for maternity, for your people for children that crosses all the political boundaries, and outlives the political cycle beyond our three years?
Seriously, Johan, what country are you living in? Hasn't New Zealand had to suffer the last 36 plus years at the hands of ineffective long term maternity/birth/CYPS plans crafted by you lot, which dragged on way too long after the horse was dead while you kept flogging it and saying, "give it time, it will work"?
Then you say, "When you go home, go and talk to your politicians. Make sure they understand the seriousness of the issues and that they commit to THE SOLUTIONS.... it's going to take an "all-of-the-country" approach to solve the first thousand days."
Everything in your impassioned plea, adds up to more money for you, for big brother boys, for monitoring services to teach parents you portray as dumb and in need of education.
Never once in all this rhetoric was there any mention of where the real solutions lie, nor was there any dawning in your consciousness that YOU and all the systems you have previously put in place, are part of the problem.
Not once is there consideration for research into the real reason as to WHY there is a housing shortage, and what really lies behind that. That might have everything to do with political policies which encourage the buying up of properties, and inflating the prices of them for their own gain.
But even worse, never ONCE in your rhetoric, and ideas, was there any thought of, mention of... ... God forbid .... asking the major stakeholders of this country - mother and fathers, . . . what THEY NEED.
Sitting down and talking to them. I understand your reticence, because you might discover one size does not fit all, and your ideas are extremely simplistic. Not once do you ask: "How has the medical model failed you?"
AS in the 1980s, your kite is just another idea to get more money to enforce more control, compliance and conformity. You have embraced consultation with Maori and organisations - because you see that as your “solution” to problem children. Is it?
The last big elephant in your room, is that there is no analysis, discussion with, or the embracing of the needs or aspirations of the people you don’t see in your clinic, who are equally disenfranchised. They love their children…. who also happen to matter.
Like the teacher focusing on problem children, your focus is on the tiny minority. The solutions you cite to solve that problem parents will not be welcomed by the ignored majority who don’t need even the present big brother breathing down their necks.
Your solutions, Johan, are all about the medical model, that can only be achieved through the dollar sign. It looks like its about money, to achieve your goals, your standards... and satisfying your theories, and dare I say it - making a name for yourself?
You ignore the mother's integrity and heart. You censor information. You regularly negate the right to decide, and treat those whose choice is not yours, as criminals. You ignore a mother's right not to be bullied.
You don't consult with us.
You don't "hear" us.
When will you ever learn?

Johan Morreau - the ugly
Hilary Butler - Sunday, October 16, 2016
Johan Morreau. Let's talk about the real elephant - the reality you sweep under the carpet.
. You say, "I'll never forget a child I once saw. Dad was at home looking after this baby of just a few months of age, mum was at the supermarket. The child was crying CONSTANTLY. he was holding the baby like this. The child was crying and he couldn't cop, and he shook the child (light shake). The child continued to cry. he shook the child again. The child went pale, stopped crying, and a few minutes later, had a convulsion. He brought the kiddie straight to the hospital. When I explained to him that his child had just had a brain bleed, he leant over his baby and he wept, and he wept. No-one had taught him how to deal with the situation he found himself in. I wonder if he had ever met a child health worker."
Let's analyse this. The unspoken message is: Shaken baby syndrome because dumb dad caused a brain bleed with that little jiggle you demonstrated.
Typical medical assumption. There are a few problems with that assumption. If that baby was on your watch, why do you "wonder"? Shouldn't you know the care provided to that baby?
For a mother to go to a supermarket alone without her baby tells me one thing. That baby had been screaming, not just for an hour. Or even an hour or two. That baby was probably a vaccinated SERIAL screamer.
So let me ask you some questions. Was the baby a premie baby, born under your watch?
Was that premie baby immediately cord clamped by you, depriving it of stem cells and the blood it so desperately needed to have a better start?
Did you load that premie baby with vitamin K immediately at birth?
Have you ever wondered why it is, Johan, that all babies are born with low vitamin K? Or do you just assume it's a mistake, and that every baby must immediately have it's blood made many times thicker than that of an adult? Did you know that low vitamin K levels is a trigger to switch on the body and brains ability to mobilise stem cells, to fix damage which is inevitable during birth? And that by whacking in vitamin K that actually, you just might PUT some babies at risk in a way you have not thought about before?
Was that mother told her breast-milk wasn't good enough, so that in NICU you could use fat-enriched formula on the monstrous myth that that is much better for a premie? Did that baby also get serial clusterbomb antibiotics, because - as we all know - formula often leads to necrosing enterocolitis in neonatal units?
Did that formula, then antibiotics, also lead to microbiome destruction, disabling the normal immune system priming of that baby and leaving him behind the 8-ball from then on?
Even if the mother maintained any semblance of breastfeeding, was her diet so inadequate that her vitamin D levels were rock bottom, and vitamin C levels undetectable, so she didn't have in her, what it takes to make healthy breast milk? Do you talk to your parents about REAL health, Johan?
If that baby had everything I wrote above, done to it, then that baby's bones weren't laying the collagen down properly, the collagen throughout the body was poorly knit and the whole vascular structure fragile and at risk. And if that baby was fully formula fed, were they using the cheapest one they could afford and watering it down too much? You have to know, as a paediatrician, that weight and height charts only tell you about chubb, NOT about what's really going on inside a baby.
Did you do full skeletal xrays looking for Harris lines, bucket fractures and all the other tell tale signs that Emery so passionately explained in the older medical literature when he proved that the VAST majority of babies THEN called SIDS, (but who would now be called "Shaken babies") were malnourished even in utero?
Did you just blame a father for Shaken Baby Syndrome, because your conformed thinking means you didn't do the tests needed on the baby or the mother to discover that actually YOU were asleep on your watch? Do you think that had you been awake on your watch, that not only could that baby have still been alive but the father wouldn't be living with your accusations that he had ignorantly killed his own baby?
That's another elephant in the room isn't it. It's not just parental ignorance, its paediatric assumption, leading to a circus investigation, which results in a pre-ordained judgement. As Emory said, you can't get the right answers, if you ask the wrong questions.
You talk about suicide rates and going back into NEWBORN NOTES and finding that the situation was predictable, and preventable. Predictable by who and preventable by what?
Johan, since 1981, every few years you guys present parliament with your latest and greatest green paper on children's issues with plans to "fixitall". I've read them all. And made submissions to most. Every single one of them misses the point and ultimate misses the mark, as you have pointed out. You no doubt put your two cents worth into all that lot as well. Think of the flip-flops and roundabouts, that culminated in CYPS which is now about to be disembowelled - because it's unworkable. What do you have to show for your previous ideas, other than a serial "fail"?
To be continued - Part 4. Continue Reading
Johan Moreau: the elephant.
Hilary Butler - Sunday, October 16, 2016
Johan Morreau: You talk about US going to our politicians and asking them to commit to THE SOLUTIONS. The “elephant in the room” according to Johan Morreau. Presumably… “the solutions” that you espouse. You use the term “we”, therefore I am assuming that you are speaking on behalf of your colleagues and the system, and that the presentation isn’t just your personal opinion.
You say, this needs to be an “all-of-the-country” solution.
Don’t you think , therefore, that your first move should be consultation with “the-whole-of-the-country”?
What about sit down with people like me and discuss the problems in the medical model that are already identified? Are you willing to do that? And maybe considering a local trial, to see whether or not empathy, compassion and connection can start first, in your house?
We have plenty to discuss. First your satisfied youtube review of the medical model: ( transcript )
"In health we've done lots of good things:
1) Improved standards of care in our maternity hospitals:
Hmmm.... good things... improved. Ummmm. For whom? The nurses? The doctors?
Every email or message I've had says it's worse in 2016, not better. Even midwives are disgusted at your comments.
2) Our newborn department.
What planet do you live on? Since I hit the publish button on the first blog I've been deluged with ongoing dramas ranging from the fact that Motueka maternity hospital does NOT allow skin-to-skin except for brief breast-feeding, to a family, in a mainstream hospital with a baby forced onto IV antibiotics on the say-so of a doctor. Not one symptom of significance, no fever, just episodic heavy breathing ONLY when the baby is separated from the mother and forced into the hospital plastic baby holder. No consideration that the problem might be a version of separation anxiety.
3) Our surgical care of children is fantastic.
I will give you a bit on this one. Comparing what is done now, with what was done in 1981, SOME things are better. At least no-one is now told, as I was told, that "newborns don’t feel pain" Remember that day? You were standing there, when the head paediatrician said that, and you didn't even wince. However, today, newborns are traumatised by far more tests, tubes and assaulted with vaccines because you think it's good for them, YET before babies are vaccinated, NICU is warned because you know that after you give sick babies vaccines, particularly premies, your staff are going to get extra practice with bradycardia, oxygen sats dropping, breathing irregularities and monitors going off twice as often. But that doesn't matter does it. Policy is what matters.
4) Care of children with cancer is beautifully done.
Again, is that your view, or the children’s' views? Parents are basically held hostage to a system and know no different. But I will give you one thing. The support services are very compassionate, because they know that the most likely outcome WILL be death.
5) Immunisation has changed the face of child health medicine. We don't see a fraction of the sick, dying and damaged children that we used to.
I have three views on that Johan.
First, I have the mortality and morbidity data available since 1872, therefore know the facts, and you are dreaming. Do you realise that the NUMBERS of NZ cases of polio in this country between 1872 and today just about matches the number of cases of preventable medical error you guys cause in 18 months? Do you realise that the numbers of polio deaths equates from 1872 - today, equates to the number of preventable medical error deaths in this country in 3 months? My grandparents and parents lived through the worst of the polio outbreaks. I was born in the middle of on, and not one person in our extended family actually got clinical polio, but, as your literature admits…. most got natural immunity.
Oh but Hilary, you're talking pears and apples. Really? Not really. The crux is – what caused the most damage in each era. So, we’ve got rid of polio. But what are the real dangers to us, and our children in 2016? You.
The fact of the matter is that in this country, someone going into hospital now, has around a 1 in 20 chance of coming out with an additional problem caused by you guys doing something wrong. I know. I've seen that happen too. Personally I’d rather take my chances with Polio, because in New Zealand, the published nicely rounded out, estimated risks used to be one per 2,000 to get sick and 1 person out of each hundred sick people, ended up with paralysis.
When my son was in ICU for a week as an adult, THREE other patients were there at the same time because of preventable medical error committed in the previous few weeks. Whether they got into the data-base detailing your mistakes is another matter. And if it hadn’t have been for my eagle eyes, my son could have landed up joining them.
And that's another thing. You know, don't you, that the data for your preventable medical error, nosocomial infections etc, aren't publically available? When I asked the Statistics department why, I was told that "it might confuse people". In what way, Johan?
Secondly, since I first met you in 1981, there have only been subtle infection shifts... like Hib - a bit of pneumococcal, and measles. You say it’s changed the face of child health medicine. True. Now you have a generation with such serious chronic and allergic illnesses, that you’re running out in circles with no real solution to offer. Have you thought about why it is that acute disease has been swapped for chronic ill-health?
In the time you've been a paediatrician, whooping cough has increased hugely, and the small drop in the other infectious diseases has been replaced by an explosion in MRSA - largely of your making - cellulitis, child cancer, child chronic diseases of rates never seen when you first studied paediatrics. In fact, children's hospitals are still run off their feet with infections in fully vaccinated children, which are actually getting worse and harder to treat, like childhood cellulitis. Isn't that right? I have plenty of nurse friends, who give me running monologues.
Another thing they tell me is that many of these problems stem - not from the government funded systems not working properly, but from parents who think that daily nutrition is comprised of a meal balanced on the knee. Twisties, lollies, white bread and coke. Even worse are the streams of intelligent people posting pictures of what is supposed to pass for hospital nutrition, on Facebook. It seems you guys have no clue of nutrition, so what incentive do parents have to change their ways?
Since 1981, it's been my experience that you rarely see the children of responsible parents who understand nutrition except for accidents - but the irony is - and please tell me if I'm wrong - the vast majority of your patients in your hospital are fully vaccinated good little medical doggies. Right? Who all have no clue what real health is all about, because neither do you.
6) Then you say, "So you would think we would feel pretty good about this, and we sort of do, but there's an elephant in the room"
So plainly you do feel good about how the system operates today. Delusion number one. The real elephant is the one you studiously ignore.
Then you show us pictures of babies, uncles, fathers and connections. (All white pictures. Why is that?) You talk about love and connection from the first day of conception through 1,000 days that grows and develops an infant's brain. That their primary attachment figure is their mum, and they will learn empathy and understanding etc etc. (transcript) Then you say, "We in child health are increasingly seeing the impacts of poverty - financial poverty, poverty of parenting, poverty of spirit and hope... struggling stressed tired parents - no time to give to their children. Often young, sometimes addicted, lacking their own parental models and lacking parental support.”
Now, I agree about this current generation. Their own parents are often addicted to TV and video games, and ignored them, so it’s little wonder their primary linkage is IT. These kids don't connect well face to face, and even in their own groups primarily converse phone to phone. Take them out in the bush where there is no wifi and they cremate emotionally, because they have no idea how to survive without their blue screens.
Bullying is rife. Ignorance is rife. They are fearful to the max because they are ignorant which is actually good for you because you can scare the pants off them once they are in your office and they buy it, hook, lie and stinker. You actually like this malleable group because they don't give you much trouble. They just roll over and do what you say. It’s the ones in this group that are also drug addicted and have gone off the rails that are the real problem, right? And most of their children are fully vaccinated. Ironic really.
Some of those less addicted to their Ipads, are instead, addicted to their friends, coffee cliques and live off the backs of the opinions of their groupies. You like this group too, because they also just do what you say as well.
The group you really hate though, (and hardly ever see, but blame for all your immunisation woes) are people like me. Who brought our kids up in the garden and the mud - who fed their children really well, so that when they did get sick it was nuisance value only. No, we didn't vaccinate.
Neither did we put our children into school where you have so sneakily corrupted the hearts and minds of the children and teachers, by acting as vaccine and thought police .
At first our kids may have thought they were deprived, but as time went on they realised the plus side of not being forced into your moulds. They achieved things that wouldn't have been possible if we'd put your handcuffs and balls and chains on their thinking processes.
7) You say, "No money means accessing health care is difficult"
For us, "No money” meant finding easier and better ways to heal our children. “No money” gave incentive to find answers "outside of the mould", even if wooden apple boxes were part of our furniture.
8) You say, "Food is often inadequate". Well, that's sort of right and wrong.
Right, in that often these parents are ignorant and think that junk food wouldn't be sold if it wasn't good for you. Food for their children COULD be adequate, but often these parents priorities go like this: Drugs, alcohol, smokes, disposable nappies ... oh.. and the cheapiest food they can buy.
The ultimate drug addicted "ME" generation which has accidental "add-on" children, who just don't feature in their priorities, are your problem children.
And just like the problem kids in the classroom who suck up 90% of the teachers attention leaving everyone else ignored, these parents also suck up 90% of your attention, leaving the silent ones ignored. The problem is that the numbers of those who have lost the plot, is starting to grow alarmingly. Their parents are truly on a planet of their own.
But so are you on another planet, because you are the system and you still think the system can fix it. The problem is the elephant in the room isn’t the one you think it is.

Which elephant is that, Johan Morreau???
Hilary Butler - Wednesday, October 05, 2016
Johan Morreau. (Part 1 of a FOUR part series) Yes, I watched your 3rd October 2016 Ted talk.
But guess what. You (both "you" personally and "you" the medical system) missed one group you don't talk about, yet it's a very big issue. It seems to me "you" are only looking through reductionist narrow blinkers. The elephant in the room isn't just "connection and protection" of the groups you describe, in the way you describe. There is more than one way to be deprived of "connection and protection".
The biggest ignored elephant in the room, sits in YOUR room; YOUR system, and is YOUR problem. Are you too scared to look at it Johan?
You probably don't remember me, Johan. You, and Elizabeth Wilson, were involved in my first labour and delivery in Middlemore. You were personally "charged" with explaining to me what would happen to my son after birth, while I was in active labour, in a situation that would become a total nightmare of medical mismanagement.
Neither you nor Elizabeth made any attempt to support me, or my son in the face of a brutal senior paediatrician on a power trip, whose aim was NOT the protection of my child. Seemingly you were too scared of him, to be a human. Continue Reading
Anne Mae Braiden
Hilary Butler - Saturday, June 18, 2016
Today, the Herald posted this article from another person saying, “"Do not tell me that not vaccinating your kids isn't hurting anyone but your own kids," ( Annie Mae Braiden's facebook page ) ( pdf )
I have some questions for Annie Mae Braiden, who says she is provaccine and would never consider not vaccinating.
1)	Did you, or did you not have the whooping cough vaccine scheduled for 36 weeks, which the medical profession alleges prevents babies getting whooping cough?
If you received it, did it occur to you to ask the medical professionals in the hospital, why it didn’t work?
2)	Are you aware of the research which clearly shows that it’s the people VACCINATED against whooping cough, who each time they encounter whooping cough,carry and incubate it in their lungs and spread it around for 42 days? ( Warfel)
3)	Are you aware that it is these incubating vaccinated people who are RESPONSIBLE for the development of the new pertactin deficient strains which are much harder to treat than the common garden varieties?
4)	Did you have the whooping cough type that your baby had, tested to see if it one of the pertactin deficient mutated strains created ... courtesy of the acellular vaccine?
5)	Did you know that the majority of whooping cough cases are now happening in fully and appropriately vaccinated children and adults? (And actually, they always did - - at least in New Zealand....)
THEREFORE…
6)	How are you so sure that your baby caught whooping cough from someone who is walking around, healthy and unvaccinated, rather than all your baby's aunties, grannies and your friends, whose vaccines long since wore off and who are carrying the bacteria and spreading their silent infections far and wide?
Seems to me that there are sweeping assumptions being made here, by both the mother and the Herald.
If either Annie Mae or the Herald, want to promote the current propaganda party line, the story headline should read either:
“Gutted that I didn’t get the 36 week pregnancy whooping cough vaccine!”
Or
“Gutted that the 36 week pregnancy whooping cough vaccine didn’t work!”

Polly Gillespie - when truth matters
Hilary Butler - Monday, May 16, 2016
Polly Gillespie is not one for letting the facts get in the way of an emotive story, even when it concerns the tragic death of her sister. Polly got her sister’s cause of death wrong, her sister’s age wrong, the day she was admitted to hospital wrong, and the day she died wrong. In addition, Polly thought nothing of dishing out hate and literal threats of violence to individuals who dared to question the integrity of her story or don’t get vaccinated. If the provable facts were wrong, what information was correct in the article which was a jock-shock attempt to use emotion to get people to have an influenza vaccination?
The usual ‘skeptics’ accepted her error-ridden story as fact, and lauded her for her courage, perhaps unwittingly, embracing woo-science to promote their cause. Her flawed story was spun around cyberspace by so-called objective experts, such as staff at IMAC, in the hope of scaring a few more folks into having their annual shot at the flu vaccine altar.
On Monday 9 May, 2016, a formal complaint was lodged with the New Zealand Herald in the matter of three articles present on their website:
1) Twelve Questions: Polly Gillespie 1 May 2014 . . . . PDF
2) Polly Gillespie: Losing my Sister 2 May 2016 . . . . PDF
3) Polly Gillespie: Messages of Support over Flu Death 6 May 2016 . . . PDF
PDF of Detailed complaint to the Herald.
Why did I make the complaint? Because:
The Herald and Polly Gillespie, are supposed to be bound by the New Zealand Press Association standards. Both the Herald and Polly have breached those standards. Although there are three more working days left before the New Zealand Herald is due to reply (this blog made live on 18th May) , the Herald has not even acknowledged receipt of the complaint. If the Herald has not replied by 5 p.m. on Friday, or if they consider there is no basis to the complaint, an additional complaint will be laid with the New Zealand Press Association. Polly's incorrect Herald facts continue to be quoted by other publications as if they are the truth, so in the interests of the public, here are the facts relating to the three articles in the Herald.
Everyone who ran off and got vaccinated with the flu vaccine in a total emotional panic, because they believed Polly's columns, ... should wake up to the fact that not everything written in a paper upholding the New Zealand Press Association standards will meet those standards.
Most importantly, perhaps Polly embellished her story hoping that no-one in the crowd would use a mouse to check her facts, and relied on the crowd to believe every word that dropped off her pen into their heads.
Ever heard the statement that, "Crowds Lie. The more people, the less truth"? SØren Kierkegaard explored this theme from many angles in all his writings. On pages 320 - 22 of his book "Concluding Unscientific Postscript", he said that when we "admire and blubber" in the presence of what we regard as superior human achievement, we turn ourselves into spectators and connoisseurs and neatly avoid the call to live as humans ourselves. Admiration, in other words . . . can be a dodge.
Blind belief in the face of such admiration, can also suspend, or prevent critical thinking.
The third column by Polly is a chilling example of what happens when the gullible crowd chooses to admire someone being sparse with the truth. "But," you say, "what if we didn't know that a lie was told?"
On what basis should the crowd believe Polly? Because she has a big mouth, literally and metaphorically? ‘Buyer beware’, doesn't just apply to things obtained with money.
History through the ages is a sorry story of the unreliability of crowds to discern or even reflect the truth. You would think in an age when it's so easy to check people's facts, that the Herald, or its readers might have asked a few questions. Particularly from someone who admits to having such a creative imagination as Polly Gillespie, and who admits to being "naughty". But no.
Some questions:
Why does the participation by the majority in something - anything - , equate to uncritical legitimacy, and reduce the thinking of the crowd to mindless passivity?
Why does being a columnist, confer an impression of excellence, importance and pontifical scientific rightness?
Any student of history can show that truth can often be compressed to fit into a slogan, which is reflected in Churchill's quote, "In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies."
Unfortunately, the issue of vaccination is also talked about with a "wartime" mindset, and is similarly attended by a bodyguard of lies.
On this occasion, Polly Gillespie is not an unwitting victim of those lies, though perhaps she might believe a complaint against her, makes her a victim. She was the creative perpetrator.
The victims who were abused by her articles, were not only the unwitting listeners who believed her lies, and rushed to the doctor for a jab . . . but her sister, and the anti-vaccinationists who were publicly villified by an extraordinary torrent of invective.
So let’s look at the problems here. In the last few years, Polly has publicly bared her soul about how her sister Jeanette, was her very best friend for life, the light of her life, - always there for her - paid her bills etc etc . . . the list of expanding extollations grows with every retelling.
The core point of Polly's stories have always been that if her sister had been vaccinated, she would never have died.
Jeanette, according to Polly, "caught the flu and died five days later."
In 2014, when this story first came to my attention, Jeanette died in her "early 30's".
In the Herald in 2014, according to Polly, Jeanette was 38 when she died.
In 2016, the graphic description of Jeanette's death, and a unbridled vicious raging at non-vaccinators, was exceptionally callous, so a warning light went on in my head.
Add to the warning light, the fact that in 2000, the year Jeanette died, the flu was pretty much non-existent, and nowhere in the official death databases was there such an influenza death in the 30 - 40 year age group.
Knowing that Polly's description did not match the clinical picture of a death from "influenza", OR the data, I researched Jeanette's death using various combinations based on known facts, and the web threw up an obituary, written by one of Jeanette's colleagues (who cannot remember who actually told him that Jeanette had the flu).
Jeannette's obituary dates informed me that she was 41 at her death, not 38. So I went back to the Health Department database for deaths from the flu in 2000, in people from 40 - 45, and still found nothing.
A search of Hamilton City council's cemetery records confirmed Jeanette's age to be 41 at death. Ah ha. Now, I had a proper date.
So I picked up the phone to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and ordered a certified copy of her death certificate which says;
I studied the manual written in 2000, directing doctors how to fill out the patient’s death certificate, and discussions with Ministry of heath staff confirm that had Jeanette had the flu, it would have been written on the doctor’s certificate, and on the top line of the death certificate.
Furthermore, even in 2000, if influenza had been suspected, Jeanette would have been tested, and the samples sent to ESR in Wellington.
Severe coinfection with flu and Staph. aureus is possible, as shown in a CDC publication dated
April 27, 2012: "Severe Coinfection with Seasonal Influenza A (H3N2) Virus and Staphylococcus aureus — Maryland, February–March 2012 " which described illness and death in three family members as a result of Staph. aureus and the flu:
"All three family members had confirmed infection with seasonal influenza A (H3N2) virus. Patients B and C had confirmed coinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which manifested in both patients as MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.... Two of the three had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza."
As you see, the flu vaccine did not prevent two of those deaths.
So what provable facts do you know now?
That according to her death certificate, Jeanette did not die of the flu, she was 41 at her death, the death certificate stating her birthday as 29th August 1959, not 28th August (no year) as asserted by Polly on her facebook page on the 4th May 2016 PDF
It seems that since the complaint was filed, Polly has played catch-up, and changed her sister’s birthdate to what it should be . . .
Polly was also very specific about some things, such as, " my sister's sudden fatal bout of influenza … She got sick on the Tuesday and was dead on the Saturday."
Except that published information shows that her sister got sick on Friday and died on Wednesday. So the above quote from Polly is also incorrect.
What else were we told?
"My sister was a brilliant artist too, who sold her work when we were in college together in the US, to constantly get my sorry ass out of debt. She would pay off my dental bills, and my rent. … and when she'd finished her fine arts degrees, became a scientist."
That didn't mesh with the time frame mentioned in her obituary. PDF Jeanette's obituary said that Jeanette was a dancer and tour guide for five years at the Polynesian Cultural Center at Laie, Hawaii. Jeanette enrolled in the University of Waikato in 1987, to study for a Bachelor of Social Science degree in Geography, and the following year converted her degree to a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Earth sciences. She graduated her BSc in 1989, taking the full three years.
Jeanette Gillespie then spent another three years to graduate with a Master of Science in 1992, and in 1993 enrolled for part-time PhD study, which seemingly had not been completed by 2000.
Surely someone with multiple degrees would have been cross credited, had time remitted, and those degrees listed in her obituary?
According to Waikato University, Jeanette never asked for, or received cross credits. Her colleague who wrote her obituary has no knowledge of any other degrees. Are arts degrees something to be hidden?
More research brought up public records of both Jeanette and Polly attending a Mormon college called Christ Church New Zealand at Templeview in Western Hamilton, and Polly’s passing School Certificate in 1977, which places Polly's birth year at around 1962.
Using clues from Jeanette's obituary, more research placed both Jeanette and Polly at the Mormon Brigham University in Hawaii, which is where the Polynesian Cultural Center was located . . . yet apparently there were no degrees which came out of this particular time period.
We were then told that: "I've seen the result of not getting a flu vaccination. Jeanette told me she didn't think she needed one because she was fit and healthy.”
Yet in this 2001 ESR report , we read:
Immunisation Coverage "In 1997 influenza vaccination was made available free to those ≥65 years of age, and in 1999 free vaccination was extended to risk groups <65 years."
In 2000, it was neither the norm, nor was it expected for healthy 40 year olds to have the flu vaccine.
Plainly, Polly disagreed with Jeanette . . . by implication. Does that mean that Polly who would have been around 39 at the time, had the flu vaccine, and disapproved of her sister’s comment?
Polly claims she was on air/in the studio (presumably in Wellington) when the call came through that her sister was very ill in hospital in Hamilton. It would have taken the best part of a day to make arrangements and get to Waikato Hospital, even if flying. Jeanette had pneumonia, Staph. sepsis, renal failure and coagulopathy for 5 days, and Polly said that Jeanette's body was on life support and being dialyzed:
"The wonderful staff at the hospital hooked her up to a machine that removed her blood, cleaned it, and pumped it back through her body."
So her sister's body was shutting down. She was bleeding from her eyes, nose and ears, her lungs were full of fluid, her hands and feet turning black. With Jeanette in an induced coma a skeptic would have to ask, when could such a rational conversation with Polly asking, “Why didn’t you have the flu vaccine” and Jeanette saying, “I didn’t need it”, have taken place?
Who told Polly this was "the flu"? It would be instructive to see the medical files, but those would only be released to the executor of the estate.
So instead of a factual representation of her sister’s death, the public was bombarded with a story, some of which is verifiably false, and some indeed implausible, in order to form some kind of authenticity and legitimacy to allow Polly to say this:
The last of the three articles was about the feedback from the rant above. Polly again ranted about wanting to send the anti-vaccine crowd for an IQ test:
And Polly was delighted to report that:
“People from the health sector thanked me for my responsible position. Cool. That felt good.”
Perhaps the health sector can go and look at Jeanette Lea Gillespie's hospital file, doctor’s certificate and death certificate, obituary, and research the case. Then maybe they can explain to me, exactly what is responsible about anything Polly has said about her sister since 2014.
Or is truth not important when it comes to needling people?
Seemingly, Churchill was correct. "In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies." Continue Reading
The deadly shadow of Measles and Michael Mina
Hilary Butler - Thursday, February 04, 2016
Over the last few months since July, 2015, I’ve had a few emails from parents who have had to face down their GP’s who have been saying this to them:
1) When they refuse to have MMR, they are putting their child at grave danger because
a) measles disease eliminates all prior immunity to any diseases the child had before the illness, or to any vaccines they before measles.,
(Above quote from here . ) AND CONSEQUENTLY
a) undermines herd immunity and creates the potential for new epidemics when children with wiped immunity get those diseases again.
(Above quote from here.) The doctors told the parents who contacted me, that their scientific facts came from peer reviewed medical literature, “which wouldn’t be approved if it wasn’t correct”.
Here is the Mina article and supplementary material to this article. Reading the article and supplementary material was challenging, because the arguments are so complicated and convoluted, that even Einstein could have suffered a migraine and possibly a seizure.
To get my brain around the concepts and work out the biological plausibility (or in this case the non-plausibility of the arguments), I had to read all Mina’s references, AND all the related work that Mina did NOT reference.
Or perhaps he read them and realised that that tsunami totally undermines his immunologically illogical hypotheses. Continue Reading

Are you looking for the best Medigap insurance in Battery Park, VA? We can help you find affordable and quality Medicare Supplemental Insurance in Virginia. You can either call 888-602-5343 or enter your Zip Code above and fill out the form. We will help you find the best Battery Park, VA Medigap insurance options.
Buying Medigap, or Medicare Supplemental Insurance, is the key for many people over age 65 to be able to afford to use their Medicare coverage. Medigap is a separate policy that is sold by private insurance carriers that adhere to Virginia laws.
For the most part, Medigap covers co-insurance, co-payments, and even includes medical coverage if faced with an emergency when traveling outside of the United States. Older Medigap plans also covered deductibles, though those were mostly phased out in 2010. Medigap covers costs seen in Medicare Part A and Part B Plans. Medicare Advantage plans are also available though not in conjunction with Medigap benefits. Likewise, be aware that it is illegal to sell a Medigap holder Medicare Savings plans.
The reason people in Battery Park, VA buy Medigap is to cover where an individual’s money will fall short. Buying a Medigap policy will require monthly premiums in addition to Part A and Part B Plan premiums. Though, the fact is that there are still ways to save on Medigap coverage.
For one, apply for policies while in the first 6 months of your Medicare Part and Part B plan policies. During this period, guarantee issuance is extended to anyone over the age of 65 within the first six months. It means that there are no denials or increases in premiums because of pre-existing conditions, based upon past medical history, or current medical problems that spring up.
If an individual waits they may pay higher rates and fees for extending past the deadline. It is better to shop around and compare quotes and do so during the open enrollment period. The majority of Medicare Supplemental insurance plans are standard and demarcated by letters A through N. Each plan covers benefits but have added benefits. For instance, part D covers prescriptions.
Some plans are decommissioned already, and others are set for being phased out by 2020. Fortunately, the unavailable policies are not marketed any longer. And, if you were concerned that you are missing, know that most of the old plans are actually more expensive because the policies have fewer subscribers than today’s active plans.
That means that while cheap Medicare Supplemental Insurance plans A through G charge higher premiums, costs that are out-of-pocket are not as expensive as for Plan K through Plan N. Those carry lower premiums and like benefits but at the trade-off of costing more at the time of service.
Employer Retiree Benefits
The next way to save money beyond following the open enrollment dates is to find out if a former or present employer has a Medigap policy of its own. In general, these will be less costly than an individual policy that you buy on your own. Though, the warning and word to the wise is to carefully consider if the company is financially stable or not.
Determining Eligibility
Whenever purchasing many types of Medicare plans, you actually cancel the old policy before instating the new policy. That is not the case where Medicare A and B are concerned. The reason, recall, is that affordable Medigap insurance plan is meant to fill the gaps of conventional original Medicare policies.
It requires still being covered under Medicare. The other benefit is to know when shopping around that the policies are the same whether you buy with Humana or Aetna or BlueCross BlueShield, for instance.
What is worth looking at is the reputation of the health insurance company, the quality of the coverage they offer, and the credit worthiness rating of the insurance company. The reason to look at the credit worthiness of the company offering up the insurance is to ensure that they are likely to have the money to pay out benefits and claims as agreed in the policy paperwork.
In addition to looking for insurance carriers that have an A or greater rating in the creditworthiness area, it is important to find out about the customer service and the customer satisfaction ratings of the companies you are comparing as well. It pays to have the company that pays claims within a timely manner, without a heroic effort on your part or the part of your doctors.
Otherwise, you will spend time having to contact the Virginia insurance department or commissioner to file official complaints to get the claims paid within the acceptable two-month window. All of the Plan C Medigap coverage will be the same as that same plan from another insurer. Look at service quality and price. Look at comparing insurance company offerings to locate a cheap medicare supplement insurance plan in Battery Park, VA .
You will also need to look for separate prescription drug coverage, which is designated by Medicare Part D. This will add in an additional premium in addition to other costs. The key is that the majority of people who qualify for cheap medicare supplemental insurance are 65 and older, and look for their Medigap during open enrollment.
In addition , the other requirements stipulate Medicare Part B and Part A participants are eligible. Once you choose a cheap Medicare Supplemental insurance plan it is as if it is written in stone and can not be altered.
To be eligible for cheap Medicare Supplemental insurance plans in Battery Park, VA apply for coverage offered by insurers within your state. All policies are available in each state, though most states will have one single policy available for Medicaid plan holders.
Everyone at age 65 and older and who is also enrolled in the Medicare Parts A and B is eligible to purchase a supplemental plan. It is advisable to decide on a plan during the 6 months of open enrollment to pay the most favorable policy premiums. When comparing costs during the open enrollment, it means pre-existing conditions are not factored into the pricing for the premiums. It is the hands-down best way to save money on a Medigap Supplemental plan in Battery Park, VA .
Always find out the Virginia laws prior to shopping. They can vary a bit, though it is important to recall that the policies are uniform across states.

ABSTRACT
The First Crusade was inaugurated by the invitation of the Pope Urban II in the Council of Clermont in November 27th, 1095. Influential propagandas of the clergy among whom the leading figure was Piyer Lermit moved the people and a great army was recruited in a short time. It was composed of unprofessional grups who sought solely booty and moved without waiting the main body and arrived Constantinople in August 1st, 1096. Numerous crusaders caused a great disorder and Byzantine emperor Alexius transferred them to Anatolia and settled in Civitot. Thus they reached to the border of Anatolian Seljukids and marched near the capital city, Nicaea and gave a big damage on the region. Seljukid army had a struggle with the Crusaders in the Drakon Valley and got a victory.

Demonstration against Trump in New York
Apr 15, 2016International
Like
NEW YORK: Several hundred people gathered in New York demonstrating against Donald Trump outside the smart Manhattan hotel hosting the Republican frontrunner and his rival candidates at a lavish gala.
The crowd held up posters comparing the Republican presidential frontrunner to Adolf Hitler and accused him of being racist and anti-immigration amid a heavy police presence.
“No Trump, no racism, immigrants are welcome here!” members of the gathering shouted. “New York is a no hate zone!” another slogan said.
“The GOP platform is hate and fear,” said Jason Hurd, a former soldier who founded the pacifist movement Iraq Veterans Against the War, referring to the Republican Party.
“It’s all the same: be afraid of those people over there,” he added.
Hurd said he had come with a group of other former military personnel to protest against the Manhattan tycoon in the name of veterans.
The largely peaceful gathering broke up without significant incident although demonstrators mocked a journalist for TV channel Fox News. AFP

9-year-old girl seeks clean air for her generation, sues Indian government over pollution
Date: 09 Apr 2017
By:
Comment: 0
Ridhima Pandey is living proof that no one's too young to fight climate change.
The nine-year-old girl recently filed a legal case against the Indian government for failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions from factories, vehicles, and agriculture. The petition accuses officials of neglecting their duty to protect Indians young and old from environmental harm.
"My government has failed to take steps to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing extreme climate conditions," Pandey said in a recent statement. "This will impact both me and future generations."

What Gayle King was REALLY thinking during explosive R. Kelly interview
10/03/2019
King later said that Kelly was present in the room as she spoke to the women and that he coughed loudly as certain topics were brought up during the conversation.
The parents of Joycelyn Savage, one of two women living with R. Kelly, are speaking out a day after their daughter attacked them on national television and accused them of exploiting her for money. "That's at least one that we do know about", she said. All you have to do is push a button on your phone and say so and so did this to me, R. Kelly did this to me.
"That's our relationship. We both have our individual relationships with him".
Meanwhile, Kelly returned to jail on Wednesday due to unpaid child support. "But I never thought that he was going to hurt me". After being acquitted of child pornography in the past, a recent Lifetime documentary, "Surviving R. Kelly", led to fresh criminal charges of sexually abusing four victims, three of whom were underage at the times of the crimes.
Jussie Smollett's Case: Chicago PD Launch Internal Investigation Over False Info
On Jan. 29, Smollett arrived at Northwestern and claimed he was attacked by two men while walking home from a Subway around 2 a.m. The police department is looking into who was the culprit leaking information, which they state is "inaccurate", to the media .
In response to Azriel Clary's claim that her parents encouraged her to start a relationship with Kelly in hopes to blackmail the singer in the future and that they're now only after receiving money from Kelly, Avenetti stated, "Azriel's parents never attempted to blackmail anyone and never suggested their daughter take nude photos or sexual videos. It's real and I've known guys all my life to have five or six women, ok, so don't go there on me because that's the truth".
R. Kelly denies all charges against him and said the accusations are lies.
The Savages are still not convinced that their daughter is not brainwashed after seeing the interview and they continue to fear for her safety.
Alice explained how much of an effort she and her husband have made to get their daughter back. She said her parents wanted her to do these things for the goal of blackmailing the singer.

Feng Shui Long Island and Manhattan Team In Training asks for your help.....
Feng Shui Long Island, Inc. and Feng Shui Manhattan, Inc. have always been involved with community projects and volunteering when able to. The love for motivating and inspiring others is a core key element to Feng Shui. This past year I have been consulting and personal training with many clients that have been recovering or going through treatments for Leukemia and Lymphoma. To honor them and their family members I have recently teamed up with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s (LLS) Team In Training for the Grand Canyon Hike for a cure in May of 2012.
I have a mission-to help find cures and more effective treatments for blood cancers. To accomplish that mission, I’m participating in a sports endurance event as a member of The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s (LLS) Team In Training. Like the other members of TNT, I will be raising funds to help find cures and better treatments for leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease and myeloma. I’m improving the quality of my life by participating and with your support; I can help improve the quality of life for patients and their families as well.
At no set amount, Ms. Cerrano asks for your help and if you can please make a donation in support of her efforts with Team In Training and help advance the research for cures. You can donate $10, $15, $20 or up, it's what you feel comfortable with.
The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Team in Training asks to please have all donation in by March 28th, 2012.
*All Donations are tax deductible* If you would like to make a donation please click on: Feng Shui Team in Training with Laura Cerrano
It will only take a moment of your time to make help transform a life
Thank you and many Blessings,

ICAN’s Mission Statement
Posted on April 19, 2011 by admin	
The fundamental mission of ICAN is to provide a voice for Idahoans committed to progressive social change and to develop the power necessary to create those changes. We are dedicated to the following principles:
Empowerment of disenfranchised people and development of new leadership. We recognize that empowerment may mean different things to each of us. However, we share a commitment to developing community, acquiring and using skills, reinforcing active involvement, developing a common sense of responsibility and taking action for change.
Everyone is welcome to participate – we are steadfastly dedicated to diversity.
A stable, membership-driven funding base.
The democratic process within and outside the organization.
Non-violent action in the spirit of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. These activities may include direct action, rallies, lobbying, public education research, street theater or community meetings.
ICAN’s members elect the ICAN Board of Directors, which sets policy for the organization.

Medicaid Expansion: Restoring the Power of our Vote!
Posted on May 2, 2018 by Terri Sterling	
After years and years of working to bring health care access to Idaho’s working poor and uninsured, our voice has developed the power necessary to be heard loud and clear! Volunteers and grassroots leaders from many groups across Idaho, frustrated with political agendas that have denied all Idahoans from the benefits of Medicaid Expansion, took to the streets early in January with the answer.
A ballot initiative was circulated asking that Idahoans be allowed to vote on whether the state should expand Medicaid to cover the working poor up to 133% FPL. The process was made challenging by many requirements including collecting a qualifying amount of signatures from 18 districts. In addition, even more signatures were required.
ICAN members have long known the benefits Medicaid Expansion would bring to Idaho. In addition to saving thousands of lives, the expansion would also create new jobs, and save taxpayers money.
Several reports located in our archives indicate that Medicaid Expansion could create an estimated 13,000 new jobs. These jobs would likely be living wage jobs that offer good wages and benefit packages. These jobs would also address the overall shortage of health care providers across the state.
Medicaid Expansion will also lower our tax burden. When the ACA was implemented, it authorized Medicaid Expansion for states cover lower-income families. Part of the plan included removing funding for indigent care to pay for the expansion. Idahoans having been paying federal taxes for the program, however by not expanding the program, our representatives have essentially been giving our money to all the states that chose to expand their programs instead. In addition, we still have indigent care costs that result in higher state and local taxes, including property taxes!
Well in case you haven’t figured it out yet, after months of hard work by a large, spontaneous, and organic group of amazingly fabulous and fearless humans, the vote will go to people!
One of the greatest outcomes of all of this, up to this point, is restoring the belief in democracy and the power of our vote. Many people believe that their vote doesn’t make a difference, yet 60,000 signatures had the power to do this! In November, Idaho voters will be heard on this issue and all votes will definitely count.
Clearly, the outcome we care about is saving lives. While the ballot initiative is a milestone, the work is not done. Voter registration and voter education is critical to bringing health care home for all Idahoans.
Will we build the power to build do it? Stay tuned and watch us!

The Power Gap – ICAN News – Fall 2016
Posted on September 7, 2016 by Terri Sterling	
In this issue we will cover:
*Date Change* Annual Meeting / Karen McWilliams Memorial Brunch is September 24th
Member Spotlight: Kathryn McNary
Institutional Member Welcome
CFPB Comment period ends October 8, 2016
Voter Registration 2016
College Scholarships for undocumented students
Health Care Workgroup seeking testimony September 28, 2016
Annual Meeting 2016: September 24, 2016
Calling all ICAN members! **DATE CHANGE**
ICAN’S Annual Meeting 2016 will now be held at the Boise ICAN Building located at 3450 West Hill Road, Boise Idaho on Saturday, September 24, 2016 from 2:00-6:00 pm. All ICAN members are invited to attend as we set the issue priorities for 2017 and members will vote for ICAN’s Board of Directors 2017! As always this is a family event where your issues are our priority and your vote really makes a difference! Register here.
Karen McWilliams Memorial Brunch
Please join us on Saturday September 24, 2016 from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm for a delicious brunch and an inspirational conversation as we remember ICAN’s fearless heroes. Please register here.
Member Spotlight: Kathryn McNary
Kathryn McNary has been a member of ICAN for more than 15 years. Kathryn has previously served on ICAN’s Board of Directors and was instrumental in leading a campaign in Caldwell that won a City Ordinance that restricts the number and location of predatory lending businesses within the city limits.
Kathryn has door knocked on issues, made phone call to legislators, shared her personal story with the media, testified at legislative hearings, registered voters, recruited members, tabled at events, and spent tireless hours in the kitchen preparing food for large ICAN events. Kathryn has done it all and keeps coming back for more.
Part of Kathryn’s motivation comes from being uninsured. Kathryn is one of the more than 78,000 who are caught in the health care gap. The struggle is real; with severe health conditions that require expensive medications, Kathryn’s husband covers the cost for some of the most critical medications on his fixed income. Unfortunately some medications she simply cannot afford at all.
We are highlighting Kathryn because in spite of her challenges, her dedication and commitment is the heartbeat that moves our work. Kathryn called the office last week and asked how she could volunteer. She read the last newsletter and knew we needed volunteers to help register voters and wanted to know how she could get involved out in Caldwell. She set a personal goal to gather 10 new voter registrations each week. Thank you Kathryn!
Institutional Membership
We are excited to report that the United Methodist Women in Lewiston have joined ICAN as institutional members. We would like to welcome these women along with their commitment to social justice work.
United Methodist Women (UMW) involves all women in the congregation. We are a part of the largest community of Christian women in the world with over 2.5 million members dedicated to social justice. For more information follow the link: www.unitedmethodistwomen.org
CFPB Comment Period
Have you submitted your comment yet? You may comment up to four times during the comment period.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) wants to hear from you! The CFPB has proposed a new rule designed to stop the debt trap created by predatory lending and they have opened up a public comment period to hear what we think about the proposed rule.
Please take one minute and go to: www.stoppaydaypredators.org/ican/ and support a strong rule that ends the financial drain created by predatory lending. The comment period was recently extended to October 8, 2016, but don’t wait – it only takes a moment.
Voter Registration 2016
ICAN’s voter registration 2016 campaign has started and we are on our way to reaching our goal! This year ICAN has a goal to register more than 1,200 voters and we have six weeks left in this drive. We have hired a new intern in Boise and are working with our allies at Community Council of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Idaho CAMP program. We are excited to offer a few scholarships to students who exceed the goals. In addition, ICAN staff and leaders are all out in the community working to reach our goal.

In Honor of ICAN Board Member Karen McWilliams
Posted on July 21, 2016 by Terri Sterling	
The smile says it all. Karen McWilliams, senior leader and Board Member, fought for justice with kind words and a loving heart. Karen lifted everyone up believing in Justice For All and she committed her life to working for racial, social and economic justice. On July 12, 2016 Karen left us and moved on peacefully, yet she leaves our hearts a little bit bigger from all the love she gave us. She gave so much to help others through her testimony at the Idaho Legislature, letter writing and phone calls. Karen leaves behind her twin sister Sharon who remains committed to the fight for justice. We will miss Karen. Please consider making a donation to ICAN in her honor.

Environment Canada issues statement for the Maritimes about Tropical Storm Chris
09/07/2018
Tropical Storm Beryl (center right) moving across the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean Sea, and Tropical Storm Chris (top left) off the US East Coast.
"Swells generated by Chris are expected to increase and affect portions of the coasts of North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic states into early next week", the advisory said, adding that some of the resulting conditions could be life-threatening.
The NHC forecasts the storm to meander off the coast for the next several days.
The Barbados Meteorological Services reports that at 11:00 am today, Tropical Storm Beryl was 14.4N, 57.9W which is about 130 miles or 210 km to the northeast of the island.
"However, due to the continuing uncertainties associated with Beryl, any possible motion towards the north could bring the system closer to the islands, thus, watches or warnings cannot be ruled out", the Department of Disaster Management (DDM) said in its 11am update on Sunday.
U.S. Navy warships sail through Taiwan Strait
Navy ships conducted a routine transit through the worldwide waters of the Taiwan Strait on July 7-8 (local time)", said Capt. Taiwan's top China policy planner urged Beijing Sunday not to overreact to the recent passage of two U.S.
The next hurricane advisory is scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday. Martinique, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy; Saba and St. Eustatius; and St. Maarten remain on a tropical storm watch.
Interests in the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic areencouraged to monitor the remnants of Beryl.
Chances of formation are low, near zero percent within 48 hours and near 30 percent within five days.
The tropical storm, which was named Sunday morning, is expected to continue gaining strength as it hovers over the Gulf stream's warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean, AccuWeather.com reports.
A flash-flood watch was in effect for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from late Sunday through Monday evening, NWS San Juan said on Twitter.

The Significance Of The Hemp Industry To Iowa Farmers
The Iowa Senate just passed a hemp farming bill for Iowa farmers unanimously. While it’s doubtful the Iowa House will take the bill up without popular support and pressure from the public, the educational opportunities for how low THC hemp products can provide pain relief for Iowa’s farmers abound…while also increasing their profit margins and restoring their soil nutrients.
In order to understand how important hemp is to Iowa you have to understand that hemp was one of Iowa’s top crops during World War II.
The US government used to require Iowa farmers to grow hemp, and if they refused they had to pay a fine. Under Linda Upmeyer’s tutelage our history in Iowa has fallen by the wayside regarding hemp, and as future articles will outline.
http://globegazette.com/news/local/legislative-leader-upmeyer-s-son-arrested-in-creston/article_104ae196-c543-11e1-b0de-001a4bcf887a.html
For now, representatives like Upmeyer avoid rational science based drug policy to avoid embarrassment over passed decisions. Please write Linda Upmeyer as well as your Iowa House representatives and encourage them to allow the hemp bill from the Senate to be brought to the House floor for debate. While you’re at it, tell them to research what hemp is. It would have been nice if the House had worked on this and sent it over to the Senate, but the two wings don’t always work well together. Linda Upmeyer’s fear is a big part of the House’s resistance to rational, compassionate, science based programs, and this fear has lead them to make a program so terrible, nobody wants to partake in it.
While hemp CBD may be illegal at the federal level – a lawsuit challenging this assertion is due for a ruling here soon against the DEA — hemp products are still legal at the state level. So while you can still buy legal hemp products at roughly 10,000 stores throughout Iowa, Iowa farmers cannot reap the tremendous profit windfalls that come from growing it until Upmeyer’s scandal riddled legislature decides that they will grant extremely limited permission from on “high” to Iowans to be healthier and more productive agriculturally while the rest of the nation skips ahead and lets farmers discuss this openly to resolve some current agricultural issues throughout the industry.
Tremendous thank you to each and every Iowa Senator who voted to approve agricultural hemp. I’ve been told recently that my dismay at the inability of the community to come together and address the lack of education, caring, and Christ-like concern around marijuana and other racially charged drug war issues is unfounded, and to have faith that Iowans will truly care here very shortly. My ten years as a marijuana activist says otherwise. When it comes to marijuana, Iowans seem to enjoy victimizing and terrorizing those who wish to medicate in peace, while hiding any embarrassments that are virtually universal and should be seen as health issues instead of being sanctioned criminally.
You can find your legislator’s email to email them to support hemp here: https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find
Please also follow Iowa NORML and the Iowa Hemp Association on Facebook as they are taking the lead in lobbying for and promoting hemp education around the state.

Carroll Police Breaking Laws To Seize Legal Hemp CBD
Carroll Police Breaking Laws To Seize Legal Hemp CBD
Carrie Bluml has been slandered. Paperwork filed Friday, April 13th in court says she is in the right, and that the town of Carroll has some accounting to do.
People in Carroll have been saying Carrie’s shop, Nature Ammil, located at 820 West 8th Street, has been growing marijuana. Located right next to McDonald’s, Nature Ammil has been accused of having cannabis oil as a dispensary in violation of new laws (the store wasn’t). While at a firefighter fundraiser, Carrie was approached by multiple saying they heard she was selling marijuana out of her store.
Meanwhile, an 86 year old man with Parkinson’s has been going to the County Attorney’s office asking when he can use hemp CBD, without THC, so he can function.
This whole thing stems from Carroll Police and their unwillingness to cite any valid law for their warrantless seizure of non-THC hemp products since December 27th of 2017.
Denison police have confirmed that hemp CBD is fully legal. Ames Police have confirmed that hemp CBD is legal. While hemp CBD is legal, CBD sold through Iowa licensed medical marijuana dispensaries is not. That CBD, which unlike hemp derived CBD does contain THC, will be available for Iowans with a multitude of medical conditions from chronic back pain on the farm to clients with more severe medical patients, such as the 86 year old Carroll man who keeps asking for relief in a town that seems to have no compassion.
Carroll Police refuse to speak to reporters citing an ongoing investigation that is now nearly four months old. Carroll Police Sergeant Officer JJ Schreck told stated by phone that, in spite of the separate laws concerning hemp CBD, that “CBD is CBD is CBD” and that as experts on laws they cannot cite or explain, they do not submit to any authority other than themselves. That’s plain wrong.
Without adequate police oversight, communities suffer. While Carroll Police have gone undercover against local newspapers to attack freedom of speech, failing to follow proper police procedure seems to be a regular problem at the PD. While other police departments executed search warrants and followed due process requirements in other towns throughout Iowa before confirming the products sold at Nature Ammil are legal as long as there’s no THC, no warrant was served on Nature Ammil when Nature Ammil’s products were taken.
To compound the situation, the supposed drug tests cited on the December 27th police report don’t seem to have ever happened. Worse yet, the products were not properly catalogued. It appears the police are telling newspapers different stories that don’t add up.
Other town citizens have advised Nature Ammil to just let the cops abuse them. Reports of citizens saying that Carroll PD has been like this for years, and “this is just the way it is” have been frequent.
That’s why I’m writing this editorial.
As Executive Director of Iowa’s largest medical marijuana lobbying group it is my job to make sure that good hearted, value driven Iowans are defended from bullies. When 86-year old men with Parkinson’s are asking for help, someone needs to listen and respond accordingly.
CBD is a miracle. Children with epilepsy have had their lives saved when everything else failed. Older people with arthritis have found relief from the products that will likely continue to be sold at Nature Ammil post investigation with no side effects and no “high.” Opiates, which cause drowsiness and make people uncomfortable, have been replaced with CBD in many states. Iowa will be one of them in December.
But before state authorized CBD is available – for details, see Iowa Code Chapter 124 as well as House File 524 from the 2017 legislative calendar – unauthorized, non-medical CBD is available throughout the state. This legal product has always been legal. Carroll Police mistakenly thought that the new CBD law outlawed the legal hemp products. That is simply not the case.
In order for a community to be protected and well served it’s citizens must demand accountability. Before any more rumors about illegal marijuana activity are permitted to percolate, please be aware that hemp CBD is not the same plant source as marijuana CBD, and that there are two different statutes governing the substances. For further questions feel free to email me at playsoccer711@gmail.com. I have recently gotten word that COMPLETELY LEGAL FEDERALLY, STATE, AND LOCALLY, CBD OIL was seized from a number of businesses in Des Moines in the last few months as well. Please let me know if this can be confirmed.

Democrats Should Not Abandon Their Populist Roots
Trump supporters love their country. They care about whether people are getting a reasonable wage from their employer. Trump supporters are skeptical about corporate America. Fear is struck in the heart of rural America because of the corporate policies and advocacy of the World Trade Organization.
The people of West Virginia, Kentucky do not hate people of different races. They believe in the words of Jesus Christ and simply would give anyone their last dime if they know someone that happened to be their neighbor needed it.
I will always have more love in my heart for Trump supporters than I will Jeff Flake, Jeb Bush or Ben Sasse because I understand that the Trump supporters are misunderstood. The Flakes, Bushes of the world are certainly more polished and diplomatic. There is no doubt that their style is more “acceptable” on a world stage. It is difficult to be civil with people like Sasse who do not fear the loss of their own income due to an industrial revolution. I would ask Ben Sasse to go to the most rural parts of Nebraska and ask himself again whether humanity has truly dealt with the concept of an industrial
revolution in a humane fashion.
Patriotism has been confused with statism, and economic nationalism has been tied to racism or tribalism. Capitalism is a beautiful thing, but you have to realize that capitalism can and does put communities at war with each other. That competition is a great thing, but to call someone a statist due to the fact that they seek economic development for their community is not statist, it is nowhere close to the concept of statist thought.
Political consultants like Rick Wilson can call people statists until he’s blue in the face because it is always safe to presume that Rick will have the skill set to survive in this economy.
There is no doubt that the free market strategy pushed by Flake, Sasse, and Bush looks better on a chart and makes a lot of practical sense. Their approach to economics simply takes profits into account and does not factor in people.
Let me be straight with the immigrants that are coming to this country and seeking new opportunities. Ben Sasse and others may make it easier for you to get into the country originally, but they DO NOT care about you. They care about companies making money on the global stage. They care about shareholders, and truly a concentration of opportunity the likes of which we have never seen before.
Why in the world do you think some of these groups on the left and the right are so against a merit-based immigration system? Sure. Many of them are very concerned about human rights violations, genocide, etc. The truth is though that there are others who just do not care about the living situation for immigrants here in the United States. Some people will make it harder for immigrants to work in the energy sector.
So the reason that I am writing this is to offer an olive branch to Trump supporters. To urge them to stay away from the party of corporate profits, and to come back to the party of the people. We have plenty of disagreement within the Democratic Party, but the number one principle that we have is that people matter. Life is much more than an academic exercise with stats and data, despite what Ben Sasse says.
This open letter isn’t meant to be an anti-corporate rant either, the fact of the matter is though if we want this country to be great, great again, whatever you want to say we need serious commerce from sea to shining sea and everything in between.
Democrats owe Trump supporters an apology as we offer this olive branch. Appalachia is not a shithole. Middle America is not flyover country. We are talking about strong people with time-tested values, the most important value of all-being compassion.
I understand your frustration over the energy sector, and how the Democratic Party has abandoned you on this issue. I know that we as Democrats have NEVER done enough and in some people’s valid opinions anything to help replenish commerce in part of the country that has been damaged by idealistic energy policies. I supported Jim Webb for President of the United States in 2016 because I was looking for a candidate that struck the right balance between all forms of energy production. Period.
We have already seen people abandon solid people like Nick Rahall, Lucas and the Blue Dog Democrats to become Trump supporters. The truth of the matter is that the spirit to make America more economically vital again is something that Blue Dogs and President Trump have in common. I would plead with the people of West Virginia that supported Donald Trump not to abandon Joe Manchin. Evan Jenkins himself was a Democrat not very long ago.
This not an anti-profit, anti-company manifesto either, this is about patriotism and whether or not we want our country to thrive. People in the media are ready to chalk this all up to racism and want to go it alone in the world. Populism should always be a part of the Democratic Party. Questioning BAD trade agreements should always be a part of the Democratic Party. Yes, violating the human rights of workers may give some employers more freedom in life, but when did this become a principle that only this new brand of populist Republican can focus on?, It isn’t. This matter has nothing to do with race or gender.
Unethical business people like to attack blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. and women as well. Trump supporters understand this, and so do many, many members of the Democratic Party.

Paying my respects to Chief War Eagle by Gubernatorial Candidate Marco Battaglia
Paying my respects to Chief War Eagle
By Gubernatorial Candidate Marco Battaglia
“TERRITORY, It’s just the body of the nation
The people that inhabit it make its configuration
PREJUDICE, Something we all can do without
Cause a flag of many colors is what this land’s all about”
Anthrax- Indians
Wambdi Okicize is commonly known as Chief War Eagle. Chief War Eagle is best remembered as a person who believed in peace and worked his whole life toward that goal. Because of his leadership among the tribes, the Indians and the whites learned to work together without having to resort to violence. As I was touring around Western Iowa last week I was able to stop by Chief War Eagle’s burial site. Other members of his family are also buried there, including Dawn and Blazing Cloud. The vibes and the views are breathtaking. An impressive monument honors the great chief, and depicts him with the eagle feather bonnet and ceremonial pipe, symbolizing his brave leadership and his commitment to peace. Housing projects on the east base of the bluff also bear his name. I was also able to chat with Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna and watch him perform live in Sioux City. Belladonna is part Iroquois on his mother’s side. I spoke to a number of people present at the concert that were from the Winnebago Reservation and it was just an unforgettable trip all around.
The War Eagle site is awesome. The 31-foot monument of Chief War Eagle overlooks three states from atop a bluff along the Missouri River in Sioux City. His contribution to the peaceful settlement of what was later to become Sioux City has gone down as most excellent and beautiful American history. War Eagle was born a Santee Sioux in a dim Minnesota forest about 1785. He left his own tribe, the Santee, to avoid bloodshed in a fight as to who would be chief. As a young man, War Eagle spent considerable time working among the white Americans. During the War of 1812, he carried messages for the United States government, and worked among the native peoples to promote the cause of the United States against the British.
War Eagle eventually was elected chief of the Yankton Sioux. He established and maintained a good feeling among the Yanktons for the early white traders. It was during the 1830s that War Eagle was pilot on the upper Mississippi and dispatches for the early trappers up and down the river. Later, his warriors escorted U.S. mail between trading posts. During this time, War Eagle met and became a very good friend of Theophile Bruguier, a well-educated trader who came from Canada and was one of the first white traders in Sioux City. Bruguier found a fascination with Indian life and culture. He deserted the white man’s civilization and joined the Sioux tribe. Many lasting bonds were created between War Eagle and area American settlers, which set a tone of friendship that spread through the area. War Eagle refused to send his warriors on attacks against whites and this brazenness in the face of hostile and overwhelming odds marked him as a man of great courage.
Once when Sioux tribes gathered at what is now Riverside for the New Ulm, Minn., attack, War Eagle refused to let his warriors join the warring Indians. And when the Sioux were on the warpath and camped in what is now Stone Park on their way to the Spirit Lake massacre, War Eagle adamantly refused to allow his warriors to take part. War Eagle received a silver medal from President Martin Van Buren in 1837 in honor of his work in Washington, D.C. to negotiate peace treaties. War Eagle was especially proud of this Peace Medal. That visit to Washington marked the largest gathering of chiefs and warriors of different nations and tribes in history. Several treaties were signed, and these resulted in peaceful settlement of Indian tribes along both the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Aside from the wonderful monument, Chief War Eagle is also memorialized with human rights awards bearing his name, given to recipients in Sioux City that continue to demonstrate his spirit today. I believe that many Iowans would love to continue to live in the spirit of the great chief.

“It is gratifying to me, of course, to hold the undisputed world’s title. I am glad it is held in America, glad that I brought it here. But I mean my life to be more than a mere wrestling exhibition. I expect to be an Iowa farmer all my life, and make my life worth something. I hope that every year may find me a little better man in some way than I was the year before.
I want to be a good citizen and a helpful, useful man.”
Frank A Gotch
The best thing the government can do right now in regards to advances or alternatives to burning coal and natural gas for energy, or to the internal combustion engine or transportation in general, is get out of the way. We can allow for a freer market for energy and transportation. We can allow for the fairest possible competition between biofuel, gas, and electric. One day electrical vehicles may be ideal but as of the moment about 30% of our electricity in the USA still comes from coal and we make another 34% by burning natural gas. It doesn’t matter if your electric car has no emissions if the electricity it uses is still coming from burning coal or natural gas.
Hydrogen powered vehicles are another alternative on the horizon that are very appealing to me because hydrogen can be produced domestically and it burns cleanly. I feel that a freer market would allow for hydrogen powered vehicles to become a familiar competitor much sooner! There is also the potential for photo-voltaic cells powering public transportation using solar energy directly. I see great things on the horizon in terms of earth friendly transportation! Iowa can help ensure the horizon comes sooner rather than later.
Government subsidized agribusiness pollution is a leading cause of the dead zones that plague waters from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock in subsidized CAFO settings and soil cultivation practices in regards to subsidized mass monoculture are among the biggest ways that humans negatively impact the environment. They also threaten Iowans economic and agricultural freedoms in terms of recreational opportunities, water quality, and free market competition. I propose that we phase out large agricultural subsidies on mono-culture and CAFOS. We should end the renewable fuel standard. Corn has not proven to be an ideal crop for bio-fuel or animal feed and the production of corn ethanol has actually had a negative impact on the environment. To protect farmers that have invested in government aided markets we can ease away from them with subsidies for farmers that agree to meet soil conservation and water quality goals. I also believe that we need to investigate cronyism in terms of eminent domain abuse and that we need to reform civil justice so that farmers that contribute to issues such as excessive nitrates can be made to build additional costs into their business models. I have both hemp and raw dairy freedom built into my agricultural freedom plan. Hemp and raw dairy could help reverse trends in many of our counties that are declining in population. Hemp and raw dairy freedoms are good starting points that would both provide additional ways to make income for farmers that want to try new things.
My father grew up on a farm in Minnesota and I have worked my own acreage when I have been able to make the time to. I believe that hemp and or cannabis farming would be best combined with a multi-cropping plan and to mix a cash crop, cover crop, and animal feed crops (Hemp Seed products), with other grasses, rye, and prairie restoration efforts. Something like this would provide the most sustainable situation. To me if you have the acres why would you not want to find perennials that can both make money, restore pollinator populations, and help with the nitrogen problem? A comprehensive state-wide strategy for reducing nutrients would have economic benefits, as well as show improvements to drinking water, recreation and health. I wholeheartedly believe more people would already be doing this if not for the way that the government has impacted the family farm.

Gubernatorial candidate Marco Battaglia on the Clubhouse Model of Mental Health Rehabilitation.
I learned so much from my tour of Passageway mental health clubhouse in Des Moines, Iowa. I met some wonderful people that have overcome great obstacles. I encourage the other gubernatorial candidates to visit. Passageway would be very excited to give you the tour. Many people I have spoken with, who have struggled with mental health, claim finding a place that will not turn them away and help them re-enter the workforce, is invaluable to them. Passageway does these things and so much more.
The Clubhouse Model of Psycho-social Rehabilitation is a comprehensive and dynamic program of support and opportunities for people with severe and persistent mental illnesses. In contrast to traditional day-treatment and other day program models, Clubhouse participants are called “members” (as opposed to “patients” or “clients”) and restorative activities focus on their strengths and abilities, not their illness. All participation in a clubhouse is strictly on a voluntary basis.
There are four guaranteed rights of membership, which are at the core of the Clubhouse Model:
A right to a place to come; A right to meaningful relationships; A right to meaningful work; and A right to a place to return.
The members and staff of a Clubhouse work side-by-side to manage all the operations of the Clubhouse, providing an opportunity for members to contribute in significant and meaningful ways; therefore, a Clubhouse is operated in a partnership model with members and staff working side-by-side as colleagues. The Clubhouse Model seeks to demonstrate that people with mental illness can successfully live productive lives and work in the community, regardless of the nature or severity of their mental illness. I believe that it would do wonders for people to have access to this model in every community in Iowa. A year of Clubhouse rehabilitation is akin to two years under hospital care. The Clubhouse Model has proven to reduce incarcerations, reduce hospitalizations and recidivism, and it is cost effective compared to the other existing mental health care approaches. I think we need to adjust the way that we fund mental health to better align with this model. I see it as very realistic that with some start-up help from state and local government clubhouses could take off all over the state and work towards independence from state funds.
Please check out www.passagewayiowa.org when you have a chance. They would be happy to give you a tour whether you are a candidate running for office or you are just interested in the Club House model. I am actually raising money for Passageway and you can donate to support the Club House Model at this link. Marco Battaglia’s fundraiser for Passageway and the Club House Model of Mental Health Rehabilitation.
I recently sat down with a citizen concerned with the mental health crisis in Iowa. He was open about his own struggles. We decided to film our first in person meeting and conversation.

Families United Action Network in Support of Shared Parenting Bill – SSB 3154
On Tuesday, a Senate Subcommittee meeting was held to discuss SSB 3154, a bill that would create a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parenting in child custody cases. I spoke as an associate of the organization Families United Action Network in support of this bill.
Currently, when divorcing parents walk into a courtroom, it is assumed that one parent will “win” and one parent will “lose” custody of the couple’s children. This societal standard has left generations of people suffering emotional turmoil all of their lives. According to fatherhood.org, children without their fathers are twice as likely to drop out of school and seven times more likely to become teen parents. They are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol and suffer poverty. I cannot overstate the importance of a child’s own father in their lives.
These heavy statistics are painful to accept when I look at my step children. My family is a blended one, where my husband and I both have children from previous marriages, as well as our own. I ache for my husband’s children each time they hug their sobbing siblings goodbye for yet another long absence. Four days per month is not enough time to create family memories, enjoy hobbies, and impart important values. What good reason is there for two empty seats at the dinner table most nights? Their mother does not wish to share parenting and fought their father vigorously in order to keep him devalued as merely a visitor in their lives.
I have another perspective to offer, that is as a mother who does share parenting, disregarding our divorce papers to do so. My two teenage children have enjoyed living as equally as possible with their father and myself for the entire ten years we’ve been divorced. Well-adjustment in having both parents involved in their daily lives is obvious. Their father and I have each had the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with our kids, offer emotional stability and maintain trust. Shared parenting works. My children wouldn’t have it any other way.
My ex-husband and I are far from friends. It’s a misconnection that shared parenting to work requires there be no conflict. Shared parenting does require maturity and cooperation, which can learned over time after the pain of a separation. Resources exist to help high-conflict situations, such as apps like My Family Wizard, which aid communication between parents. Money spent fighting in ugly litigation for control could be spent instead on counseling to learn better co-parenting skills. In the long run, two divorced parents learning to co-parent, sharing equally in the lives of their children, without one parent being the “loser” and “visitor” is certainly in the best interest of children.
But you don’t have to take my word for it. Dr. Linda Nielsen, a professor of Adolescent and Educational Psychology at Wake Forest University, agrees with over 110 other social science experts and has reviewed at least 54 studies that overwhelmingly show that “children in shared physical custody families—with the exception of situations where children need protection from an abusive or negligent parent—have better outcomes across a variety of measures of well-being than do children in sole physical custody.”
Don’t let another generation of kids grow up missing half of their families. Don’t let another generation of kids become prizes to be won in a war where they can only lose. I urge our legislators to pass a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parenting bill so that the next generation of Iowa’s children, who must endure a divorce or separation, can maintain strong familiar bonds that will benefit them for a lifetime.

Marco Battaglia’s response to the Governor’s Condition of the State
Condition of the State Response
January 19, 2018
Marco Battaglia
Iowa is in dire need of Comprehensive Tax Reform
Governor Renyolds said that she wants to lower taxes but she has been hesitant to say what exactly her plan is. I’ve heard politicians from the right and left of me say my whole life that they were going to lower taxes. Studying the past administrations in Iowa I’ve heard these promises and this debate ongoing throughout the previous century. I am willing to say right now that my tax plan works to eliminate the income tax entirely while reducing property taxes for all Iowans. Instead of using the markets that we are working to open up, to spend more of your money, I want to use them to systematically decrease the size of Iowa Government and to simplify and reduce taxation for all Iowans; Not just ones that participate with my political party, that donate to my campaign, or that belong to a specific tax bracket.
Iowans need and deserve real solutions not “Reynolds-Care”
The Governor has doubled down saying that she believes in the current crony capitalism regarding the state’s medicaid. This is not a classic republican or a classic liberal position nor is it the right thing for Iowans at this time. I believe that true free market solutions will not leave the most vulnerable Iowans without assistance. There is this unfounded fear mongering about Libertarians that we would not look out for special needs or low income individuals and I am running in part to show that this could not be further from the reality. My platform actually works to restore access to services in regards to mental health, special needs, and low income peoples. It is my belief that that we can work to move towards a much freer market without making haphazard and dangerous cuts that effect these peoples and their loved ones.
I believe that Bill Dix should resign.
In regards to Majority Leader of the Iowa Senate Bill Dix I will go as far as to say that he needs to step down. Bill Dix, I am asking you to step down. I think that you should resign immediately. A majority of us that come from the private sector would be fired if we would have handled such behavior in our workplace in this manner.
Spending more and more money for worse and worse results?
Governor Reynolds said that we invested in our kids at a record level, committing $735 million more for education since 2011. Reynolds also said that over the last 10 years, only three states increased education funding at a higher rate than Iowa. I am not proud of this. The state’s growing contributions to K-12 don’t translate dollar-for-dollar to districts’ budgets. For decades—and as recently as 1992–Iowa students either led the nation in student achievement or were right at the top of the pack. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills began, not surprisingly, right here in Iowa. So did the ACT assessment. No state can afford to be self-satisfied and to perpetuate the status-quo and I am afraid to say that our administrations since have done just that. Over the last two decades, Iowa has stagnated educationally. Many states, and even other nations, are now outperforming Iowa. I beseech the Governor to take a look at the fact that Iowa is the only state in the nation that hasn’t made significant progress in early math education since 1992. Iowa now ranks in the bottom ten states in the percentage of high school seniors who take and pass an Advanced Placement course.
I believe arguments that more English as a second language students, or that more poor students, play a role in this, are entirely bogus. More than 80 percent of Iowa’s students are still white kids that were raised knowing English only–and these students are no longer among the best in the nation. In fact, reading scores for non-poor, white students in Iowa on the NAEP assessment are now below the national average for their peer group. Students in 29 U.S. states are more likely to be advanced in math than these students in Iowa. And all students in 30 nations and provinces are more likely to be advanced math students than just these students in Iowa. In the knowledge economy, that is not nearly good enough–because Iowa students are no longer competing just against their peers in their community or in their state. They will be competing with students for jobs and admission to higher education with students from places like China, South Korea, Canada, India, and Russia. I actually believe that being bi or multi-lingual is an amazing thing for children to be and actually an early indicator that one is going to grow to be very intelligent. I need everyone that wants to participate to consider what kind of return we are getting on our investments here? Are there true school choice and free market solutions that could move us in a better direction at a much lower cost? Is there any excuse for a child with educated guardians and connection to the internet not to have access to a world class education in the year 2018?
I believe that Iowans should be able to set their own high bar in terms of education standards. State and local governments should be able to lead the way on raising standards, measuring and supporting teacher and leader effectiveness, re-evaluating the skills that children are taught, and closing achievement gaps. Iowans need the freedom to be leaders in implementing innovation to increase and improve learning. Iowa has one of the weakest charter school laws in the nation, limiting educational flexibility and experimentation. Iowans need true alternative certification programs and options for true competition, creating incentives for teachers or else we will continue to export our top talent to other states and other countries. Reynolds was right that the state’s contribution to K-12 education has increased by about $735 million since 2011 and she was right that over the last 10 years, only three states increased education funding at a higher rate than Iowa, but I would not use these items as a bragging points myself. A vast majority of Iowans believe that every child in all parts of Iowa should have access to quality education. I believe that my vision is best suited to ensure us a path there and that it ensures that we are improving on education for years to come. I believe that we can work smarter to improve education and actually save significant amounts of our money while returning Iowa to being a state that churns out people with world-class educations and skills.
Make Mental Health A Priority
Governor Reynold’s actually had the nerve to brag about the status of Mental Health Care in Iowa during her address. Perhaps if she was at the Gubernatorial mental health forum that I attended, she would have heard what Iowan’s think about the state of mental health care in Iowa. I don’t see how she could feel positive about being complicit in the direction that we having been going for decades on mental health in Iowa. I believe so strongly in my medical freedom platform that I am willing to say that it will not only increase care access to levels never before seen in Iowa but that it will draw top mental health professionals from all over the world to Iowa.
End the War on People
Not only was Kim Reynolds inaccurate with her numbers in regard to opioids during her address but why does she or any other elected official even bother to keep talking about them without addressing solutions to the problems? My medical freedom platform works to end the war on drugs so that addicts can ask for and receive help in lieu of fines, imprisonment, criminal records, and forced labor. It gives those that need pain relief alternatives to opioids if they choose them. This gives medical and public safety professionals affordable access and the ability to use life saving measures in every instance of opioid overdose. Under my vision officers of the law, legal, and medical professionals will all be able to focus on the violent crimes that are going on in Iowa. By expunging the records of those charged with non violent drug crimes we will return many people to the workforce and allow many Iowans to work their way up the economic ladder.
Give Iowans their land back
I understand that a Governor is unable to touch on everything in such an address but I must say that I am also disappointed that the Governor did not touch on opening up new markets for Iowa farmers such as hemp and raw dairy, and with how did she did not address the pressing pollinators, soil, and water quality issues.

The Iowa Free Press Reflects on MLK JR DAY 2018
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.”
“I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”
“Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.”
Taken from
“Letter from a Birmingham Jail [King, Jr.]”
Last year we talked about the power of boycott and the right that we all have to peaceful protest. This year I thought that we would talk about individual liberty. The most damned, banned, excluded, condemned, forbidden, ostracized, ignored, suppressed, repressed, robbed, brutalized and defamed of all ‘Damned Things’ is the individual human being. No one can, nor should, ever take away from a persons struggle. I simply find that for the declaration of independence, the constitution, and the bill of rights, to be worth the paper that they are printed on, that they must apply to everyone in their bounds. In 2018 I see similarities in the plights of every type of minority. Religious minorities, homeless of every color, racial minorities, lgbtq peoples, refugees, immigrants, ect. ect. As we are finally in a position to ensure that the founding beliefs of this country apply to all within our bounds, I am reminded that Dr. King was more upset not with those that commit aggressions but with those that stood by idly and did nothing.
Iowa has played a prominent role in the civil rights movement going all the way back to the beginning. Dred Scott, whose legal fight for freedom was ruled on in the 1857 Dred Scott Decision of the United States Supreme Court, lived with his family in Davenport as he followed his master to various military postings in the Midwest. Scott and his wife based their appeal for freedom on the fact that they had been held for extended periods of time in free states and territories, including Scott’s stay with his master in Davenport in 1834-36. An historic plaque was installed at the site of Scott’s residence in Davenport. African Americans fleeing both slavery and the Civil War came to Davenport because it was a major port in a free territory on the Mississippi River. Though I am still greatly inspired by reading Dr. King’s writing, this year I thought that we would look at some of his peers that helped make the world a better place for those of us that were yet to be born.
Sister Rosetta Tharpe
Sister Rossetta Tharpe influenced Martin Luther King Jr, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, to name a few personages of historical significance. Robert Plant even immortalized her in a song of his own. I would say that it is tough to hear a popular song that is not influenced by someone that she influenced. Encouraged by her mother, Tharpe began singing and playing the guitar as Little Rosetta Nubin at the age of four and was cited as a musical prodigy. She rocked the Gibson SG before Angus and Tony and she also sang while doing so. Tharpe defied religious, gender, and race roles as they were and are typically depicted during her lifetime. Her performances both shocked and awed the crowds, and were controversial as well as revolutionary in several respects. At the time performing gospel music for secular nightclub audiences and alongside blues and jazz musicians and dancers was all but unheard of. You don’t exactly have to be Marty McFly to watch surviving footage of her and experience how far out she actually was. She could and did outplay many men of the time exemplifying her skills at guitar battles at the Apollo. Tharpe toured around the world representing a nation that she proved could be tolerant, caring, and a global leader in civil and human rights. Tharpe continued recording during World War II, one of only two gospel artists able to record V-discs for troops overseas.
James Farmer
James Farmer served along MLK JR as a civil rights activist and leader. He also pushed for nonviolent protest to dismantle segregation. He was the initiator and organizer of the 1961 Freedom Ride, which eventually led to the desegregation of interstate transportation in the United States. Farmer was a child prodigy; as a freshman in 1934 at the age of 14, he enrolled at Wiley College, in Marshall, Texas. He was selected as part of the debate team. At the age of 21, Farmer was invited to the White House to talk with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt signed the invitation. Before the talk with the president, Mrs. Roosevelt talked to the group. Farmer took a liking to her immediately, and the two of them monopolized the conversation. When the group went in to talk to President Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt followed and sat in the back. After the formalities were done, the young people were allowed to ask questions. Farmer said, “On your opening remarks you described Britain and France as champions of freedom. In light of their colonial policies in Africa, which give the lie to the principle, how can they be considered defenders?” The president tactfully avoided the question. She exclaimed, “Just a minute, you did not answer the question!” Although the president still did not answer the question as Farmer phrased it, Farmer was placated knowing that he had gotten the question out there. Farmer earned a Bachelor of Science at Wiley College in 1938, and a Bachelor of Divinity from Howard University School of Religion in 1941. At Wiley, Farmer became anguished over segregation, recalling particular occasions of racism he had witnessed or suffered in his younger days. During the Second World War, Farmer had official status as a conscientious objector. Inspired by Howard Thurman, a professor of theology at Howard University, Farmer became interested in peaceful protest. Martin Luther King Jr. also studied this later and adopted many of its principles. Farmer started to think about how to stop racist practices in America while working at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, which he joined after college.
Hosea Williams
Also depicted in the photo of King on the balcony the day before his death is Hosea Williams. Williams was arrested 125 times for his militant acts of defiance while working in service to the civil rights movement. Perhaps his passion for civil rights was a direct consequence of his having been beaten so severely he was hospitalized for five weeks because he had a drink at a “whites-only” bar. Not nearly as well known as King or Jackson, Williams nevertheless was a major figure in the civil rights movement with several triumphs to his credit. Because of his efforts, Savannah, Georgia, was the first city to ban “whites-only” lunch counters. He also led a march against the Klu Klux Klan in 1987 and won a $950,000 jury award after suing Forsyth County. He later became a senator.
Harry Belafonte
Actor, singer and activist Harry Belafonte has achieved lasting fame for such songs as ‘The Banana Boat Song (Day-O),’ as well as for his film and humanitarian work. Always outspoken, Belafonte found inspiration for his activism from such figures as singer Paul Robeson and writer and activist W.E.B. Du Bois. After meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1950s, the two became good friends, and Belafonte emerged as a strong voice for the movement. He provided financial backing for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and participated in numerous rallies and protests. Belafonte helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, in which King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, and met with the civil rights leader shortly before he was assassinated in 1968.
Moses Fleetwood “Fleet” Walker
Moses Fleetwood Walker was an American professional baseball catcher who is credited with being the first openly black men to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). Walker was born in 1856 in Mount Pleasant, a working-class town in Eastern Ohio that had served as a sanctuary for runaway slaves since 1815. Its population included a large Quaker community and a unique collective of former Virginian slaves. He was also a businessman, a newspaper publisher and a scholar. He received patents for artillery shells and motion-picture devices. He wrote a book on race relations. Many people know of Jackie Robinson and it is well documented that the two ball players endured their own trials with racism in baseball. While both breaking barriers, Robinson went on to become good friends with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Not satisfied with his work on the diamonds, Robinson became even more involved in the civil rights movement after he retired in 1957. When King gave his righteous and impassioned address on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, Dodgers great Jackie Robinson stood just feet away, looking on with his children.
Kenny Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GstE32yLhU
Jackie Robinson and Kenny Washington stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the athletic fields of UCLA, as both excelled at football and baseball. Washington broke the NFL’s modern-era color barrier as a member of the Los Angeles Rams in 1946. What Kenny had to go through from his peers was in some ways harder than what Jackie Robinson had to endure. You could dodge a ball in baseball. But the Rams handed him the ball. One time in a game against the Washington, the players held him down, piled on top and put chalk in his eyes. Washington actively participated in politics.
Bill Russell
In 1950 Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted when he was chosen by Boston; Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton became the first to sign an NBA contract when he signed with New York, and Earl Lloyd became the first to play in an NBA regular-season game because the schedule had his Washington team opening one day before the others. NBA legend Bill Russell was feet way from MLK JR. as he gave his “I Have A Dream Speech.” Russell was the in the middle of his legendary career — he had five championships and three MVPs at that point — and his presence helped some understand the need for equality that extended from buses to restaurant counters all the way to the basketball court. Russell lended his presence to the civil rights movement on multiple occasions.
Gil Scott-Heron
Gil Scott-Heron was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author, known primarily for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was “bluesologist”, which he defined as “a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues”. His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. In fact, Scott-Heron himself is considered by many to be the first rapper/MC ever, a recognition also shared by fellow American MC Coke La Rock. Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled I’m New Here. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, The Last Holiday, was published posthumously in January 2012. In an extract from this memoir written the year before he passed , Gil Scott-Heron talks about when he toured with Stevie Wonder to establish Martin Luther King Day as a national holiday in the US.

Disagree/Not Disagreeable
This week I had a difficult meeting. Going into it I knew that what I had to say would make others uncomfortable and they would disagree on some of my points. If there is one lesson I learned in the C-Suite from the two larger than life CEOs in my past, you must force these meetings. Without them problems fester and become existential threats over time.
But, you have to follow some basic rules:
Over prepare and pre-meeting question all your facts and opinions;
Assume the best about your colleagues;
Do not expect to win an argument, rather expect to solve a problem;
Breath and listen. Do not hold your breath and talk;
Read body language and listen for areas of agreement.
It was a great meeting. At times very difficult, but my colleagues and I agreed on a path forward. Pretty confident we are on the way to identifying the root cause of the issues and solving them.
Climate Change for Adults
I find discussions of climate change as frustrating as gun control. People immediately go into their corners, then come out swinging. But in the last Parks and Wildlife Commission Meeting and at the Colorado State University Short Course on Wildlife Management, I saw people across all political divides and geographies in agreement. Things on the ground are changing and we have limited resources to spend on mitigation and adaption.
Conservatives who ranch or have outfitting operations or liberals using trails in urban settings notice the change in flora and fauna. In both meetings the science focused not on temperature ranges, man versus natural change, and other science related to causation. Rather the science focused on where to deploy assets.
So, where are animals moving, where are plants regenerating? Using White Bark Pine mapping as an example, where are the trees naturally regenerating from pine beetle infestation? Focus management resources on those areas to help nature and log in the hopeless areas.
Journalism Ethics
Ever since my high school reporting days for the Highland Park Bagpipe media bias from all sides has bothered me. Once I was a lawyer regulated and constantly studying the ethics code, journalism ethics in one area has bothered me in particular.
Pause for readers to make lawyers and ethics jokes.
Lawyers are required to disclose to their clients and often the court their conflicts. This usually means, investments, opinions, other clients, and anything else affecting their independent representation of their client or their obligations to the court. Journalists instead pronounce themselves objective.
That has always struck me as silly. Journalists are humans too. Perhaps even more so than lawyers. So, why not have journalists declare their beliefs somewhere in their publications? Particularly with digital journalism, you could simply have a section where each reporter provides a brief description.
“Jane Smith is an economics and business reporter who personally favors government intervention in the free market to curb the excesses of capitalism, higher taxes to fund such intervention and social programs to support those displaced by capitalism.”
Then readers would consider that bias as they read the “objective” reporting. No longer would partisans pick apart articles over supposed bias, the reader could deal with the actual bias. Personally, I think this would improve journalism’s declining trust with large segments of the population.
I mean really are Dan Rather or Megyn Kelly objective? Of course not, but they are still good reporters most of the time.

Argument Against Voter ID Laws Is Itself Racist
By Richard Larsen
Published – Idaho State Journal, 03/23/14
Attorney General Eric Holder has been attempting to quell the rising tide of states opting for voter identification laws. Not even delving deeply into the issue raises the immediate question of why the top law enforcement officer in the country would be opposing efforts to maintain integrity in our election system. A government that is dependent on the electoral process should have a vested interest in ensuring electoral integrity. Contrary to the administration’s rhetoric, voter ID laws have nothing to do with racism even though their prima facie argument is entirely based on it.
This past week U.S. District Court Judge Eric Melgren ruled that Arizona and Kansas can, and have every legal right to, establish and enforce their new voter ID laws. Both states had enacted new requirements for voters to provide proof of citizenship with some form of government recognized identification. Holder’s Department of Injustice prevented the Election Assistance Commission from issuing amended federal forms in those states to reflect the change. The states sued the federal government, and have won, at least for now. After the ruling, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach exclaimed, “This is a huge victory … for the whole cause of states’ rights.”
In their court arguments, Holder’s DOJ claimed that voter ID laws suppress voter turnout and that there is “no such thing as voter fraud.” Such a statement is nothing short of hyperbolic coming from an administration with deep roots in Chicago, which owes much of its infamy to historic voter fraud and election tampering. Holder himself hails from New York, which has its own blemished record of election tampering, as any student of Tammany Hall could attest.
Holder argues that being required to display a photo ID at a voting booth is “racist,” since it’s discriminatory to poor people who may not have one, or be intimidated at the polling station if they have to present one. From a logical perspective, at best this can be deemed fraudulent and specious. Those who Holder et al claim to be the victims of voter ID laws must have valid government identification to receive Medicaid, be issued welfare checks, to have a bank account to cash welfare checks, board planes, register at hotels, drive vehicles, and just about every point of transaction where identity must be validated. If requiring a valid form of identification is an affront to our civil rights as citizens, why are all of those institutions and establishments not charged with civil rights violation? The answer is obvious: we must be able to verify that we are who we claim to be, and it is no violation of our civil rights to be so required.
Since it’s logical to validate identity at the polling booth, which increases electoral integrity, we can only wonder at the real intent behind the opposition to voter ID legislation.
The rhetorical tool they employ to demean and minimize voter ID laws is brilliant. When logic can be suspended, allege racism. It seems to work so well with the uninformed voter and the servile mainstream media. Pathetically, though, their very argument is fundamentally based on racism itself. For their argument infers that blacks and Hispanics are not intelligent enough, or somehow incapable of procuring government-recognized photo ID! It’s not a matter of poverty, as they claim, since such valid ID is required for receipt of government services. So inherently their argument is race-based, and by definition, racist.
And let’s not be so naïve to believe that this was all accidental. Going back to LBJ’s “Great Society” programs and the “War on Poverty,” the doling of governmental “freebies” and goodies was intended to buy fealty from the impoverished voter base. This was validated by LBJ’s own words when he said, “I’ll have those n****** voting Democratic for the next 200 years.”
Even the resistance efforts against voter ID laws is corrupt. Just this past week, according to the Associated Press, “Pennsylvania Democrats were caught on surveillance tape reportedly accepting cash bribes in return for opposing voter ID in the Pennsylvania legislature. Gifts of Tiffany’s jewelry were also given to Democrat legislators from Philadelphia, reportedly in exchange for “NO” votes on a Pennsylvania voter ID bill that passed in 2012. Despite this evidence, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane has not charged any officials. Kane is a Democrat.”
With as much damage as Obamacare is wreaking across the country, it’s hard to imagine anything in it being more nefarious than we’ve already observed. But believe it or not, a few months ago a more sinister aspect of the “health care” law came to light. As reported by the Washington Examiner, “Gregg Phillips of Voters Trust and Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote discovered that an organization called Demos, which is funded by leftwing billionaire George Soros, has published a document detailing how the Obamacare law is written in such a way as to help Democrats get elected by using the healthcare law to register multimillions of low income citizens to vote. This led Phillips to declare, ‘I think it is the biggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world.’”
The Demos document is titled, “Building a Healthy Democracy: Registering 68 Million People to Vote Through Health Benefit Exchanges,” and has been the topic of extensive discussion on many leftist websites, including Mother Jones, Daily Kos, Talking Points Memo, the League of Women Voters, and Project Vote.
This should be an affront to all Americans, regardless of partisan affiliation, that one major party would be so heavily invested in “gaming” the system. Perhaps we all should ponder the possibilities of why it is not.

About the Author
More than anything, I want my readers to think. We're told what to think by the education establishment, which is then parroted by politicians from the left, and then reinforced by the mainstream media. Steeped in classical liberalism, my ideological roots are based in the Constitution and our founding documents. Armed with facts, data, and correct principles, today's conservatives can see through the liberal haze and bring clarity to any political discussion.

STAY IN-NETWORK! DON'T LET OUT OF POCKET COSTS AFFECT YOU OR YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS!
As you know, Police Officers make it a habit to be aware of their surroundings and to constantly evaluate locations and situations for threats. It is unfortunate that the same mindset should be used when dealing with healthcare providers and facilities.
The best advice we can offer to avoid large out of pocket expenses is to stay in the Blue Cross network. If you refer to the LEHB website, www.lehb.org look at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Summary of Benefits and Coverage, click on "Summary of Benefits 2017" you will see that if you stay In-Network, there is NO deductible and the plan pays 100% of the costs unless otherwise noted.
However, if you go Out of Network, you will be subject to a deductible ($500.00 for Single and $1,000.00 for Family) additionally, the plan will only pay 50% of the In-Network allowable rate. The following simplified example will demonstrate how your costs could be significant. (This example does not include lab fees and other customary charges which can be very significant).
A member's adult dependent goes to an out of network addiction treatment facility. Their charge per day is $2,548.16 times 30 Days for a total cost of $76,444.80.
IBC will pay 50% of the In-Network daily rate. The daily In-Network rate is $454.00, 50% is $227.00 times 30 Days equals $6,810.00 The member will be charged the $500.00 Deductible, leaving $6,310.00
The Out of Network facility charged a total of $76,444.80 IBC would pay $6,310.00. The Out of Network facility could "balance bill" the member $70,134.80
NOTE: Per the Affordable Care Act, the balance-billed portion of your out-of-pocket expenses won't be credited toward your out-of-pocket limit.
Therefore, the member could be responsible for the full balance of $70,134.80
Specific Terminology: Always ask the Provider or the Facility if they are IN the Blue Cross Network. Some Providers/Facilities try to mislead the member by saying "we accept Blue Cross" or "we accept all insurance." That does NOT mean that they are "In Network" or will accept the Blue Cross payment as payment in full. You would be subject to pay the balance.
Flu Shot FAQ
Q: What is the most common reason that you hear that people do not vaccinate?
A: There are two main reasons people do not get vaccinated. First, they do not believe they are at risk or that getting sick would only be a minor inconvenience. While older people, young children and those with chronic diseases are at a higher risk of flu-related complications, it is important to remember that even healthy people can get very sick or even die. Plus, catching the flu often results in multiple days out of work, the cost of a doctors visit and treatment, as well as the risk of making family and co-workers sick. The flu is not a minor inconvenience. Secondly, they may think the vaccine does not work or can cause the flu. Currently, the flu vaccines effectiveness may vary from 10-60 percent from season to season, however, it is still the best single preventive measure that we have against this disease. (Researchers are working to develop a universal flu shot, but it is still in the early stages of development.) It is important to remember that the flu vaccine is manufactured from components of the virus and does not contain actual viral particles, so it cannot cause the flu.
Q: A lot of people say I do not get the flu, so why bother. How can they be convinced?
A: The past does not predict the future, and there is no way to guarantee that you will not get sick in a given flu season. Just because someone has not contracted the flu virus previously is not an indicator of future immunity because the virus changes year to year. It only takes walking by a sick person as they cough or sneeze in your general direction to get the flu. It remains important for everyone to take steps to prevent the flu and its spread.
Q: What is something you wish everyone knew about the flu?
A: Prevention is critical because you can pass along the flu virus before you show signs or symptoms. Once you develop the chills or a sore throat, you have likely been contagious for 24 hours, and you will be contagious until 5-7 days afterward. So, it is important to always practice good hygiene, because you never know when you might be spreading germs to others (and vice versa!).

Leaked Federal Reserve Doc: Go from paper homeowner instruments to electronic. Foreclosure fraud? What fraud?
10 July 2014 12 Comments
In Legalizing Mortgage Theft? I asked who was behind the push to eliminate paper mortgage instruments and move to an easily manipulated national electronic mortgage registry to the Uniform Law Commission (ULC). ULC is drafting the Home Foreclosure Procedures Act (HFPA).
This is important to ask considering that the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) has perpetrated widespread fraud against innocent homeowners through their national electronic registry. If you own a home or live somewhere, this probably affects you.
MERS, also known as MERSCORP, has been accused of being ground zero of a Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) fraud enterprise that contributed to the 2008 economic collapse. The mortgage bankers used MERS to commandeer the land records without any legislative approval. “MERS’s system is not an alternative to statutory foreclosure law.” (See: Eleazar Salazar, Bankruptcy No: 10-17456-MM13) Today, the damage continues. MERS has been named as a defendant in countless lawsuits nationwide for illegally foreclosing on homeowners.
Enter the Federal Reserve.
In an exclusively obtained letter from Thomas C. Baxter, Jr., General Counsel and Executive Vice President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to William R. Breetz, the Chair of the ULC’S HFPA Drafting Committee, Baxter wrote: “In contemplating a companion Federal law that would authorize and institute an electronic registry and transfer system for mortgage notes and mortgages, I envision legislation that supports the creation of a national system that moves the industry away from paper but remained information rich, is transparent and accessible to all stakeholders … is credibly governed (suggesting under the supervision of Federal Reserve or FHFA –Federal Housing Finance Agency, HUD etc.) and, where appropriate, freed from state law variations.”
*See NY Fed letter to ULC below
As previously reported, ULC’s current HFPA draft erroneously claimed: “A mortgage registry does not presently exist, but there is substantial interest in its creation.” (HFPA p. 29).
In a long, wide-ranging, phone interview with ULC’s Chair of HFPA, William Breetz, after I asked him how HFPA incorrectly claimed that an electronic registry did not exist, Breetz said, “If there is a mix up, we need to correct the text … Of course, I am very aware of what MERS is and does. One of their legislative liaisons has been very active with us from the very beginning.”
The Federal Reserve is not a federal agency, despite its misleading name suggesting otherwise. The American people cannot hold it accountable. It is not known for its transparency.
During a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) court battle with Bloomberg, for instance, the Federal Reserve clearly stated it was “not an agency” of the federal government and therefore not subject to FOIA.
Baxter’s letter is cc’d to ULC’s Lucy Grelle and John A. Sebert and dated October 29, 2012.
Baxter acknowledged the “voluminous litigation,” against MERS which Breetz is also very aware of. He confirmed that “MERS is a financial market utility that is focused on meeting the needs of the lenders who own and control it.” The “lenders” are the major banks.
Baxter wrote to Breetz: “Much attention is now being paid to ways of enhancing MERS to meet the needs of borrowers and the concerns expressed about MERS by some courts.” The “borrowers” are the homeowners.
He blamed the concerns, not on the fraud, but on “the basic foundation on which MERS was built (that it must operate within the current legal infrastructure).” MERS “is fatally flawed because of infirmities in the current legal infrastructure.”
Many would disagree with the NY Fed’s counsel. In an article for Huffington Post University professor L. Randall Wray wrote that MERS is flawed because its business model is illegal:
Wall Street wanted to transform America’s housing sector into the world’s biggest casino and needed to undermine property rights to make it easier to run the scam. The payoffs were bigger for lenders who could induce homeowners to take mortgages they could not possibly afford. The mortgages were packaged into securities sold-on to patsy investors who were defrauded by the “reps and warranties” falsely certifying the securities as backed by top grade loans. In fact the securities were not backed by mortgages, and in any case the mortgages were sure to go bad. Given that homeowners would default, the Wall Street banks that serviced the mortgages needed a foreclosure steamroller to quickly and cheaply throw families out of the homes so that they could be resold to serve as purported collateral for yet more gambling bets. MERS — the industry’s creation — stepped up to the plate to facilitate the fraud. [Judge Robert Grossman NY bankruptcy court] has ruled that its practices are illegal. MERS and the banks lose; investors and homeowners win.
In an interview with Jack Wright of MSFraud.org, who had his house stolen at gunpoint by rogue banks 20 years after his loan was fully discharged, and has studied illegal foreclosures since 1997, warned about the dangers of converting paper real estate notes to be electronic, “A computer or copy machine cannot duplicate or transfer the inseparable intrinsic elements of the original; namely the rights, authority, or monetary value embedded in the original. Yet many of our courts are allowing property to be transferred by entities known for fabricating negotiable instruments and other documents to falsely claim ownership. We just witnessed JPMorgan Chase getting caught for falsifying ownership documents again in Kalicki v. JPMorgan Chase Bank.”
Wright added: “The UCC requires physical possession of the note at commencement. You can’t take a photograph of an original million-dollar painting, print it out, falsely claim it as the original, and sell it for a million dollars. Yet courts across the country authorize and even authenticate the banks’ ‘altered’ copies. In a recent Oklahoma case, the servicer for an unnamed party in interest did not have the original note. In its attempt to prove standing, the servicer eventually submitted three markedly different versions of the missing original. Judge Carlos Chapelle ignored the defendant’s motion to strike and authenticated all three. So the servicer went from having no note – to having three notes on the same property; all done unlawfully with a computer and a printer.”
Homeowners: 2. Bankers: 0
Just last week a landmark decision was handed down by Honorable J. Curtis Joyner in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Nancy J. Becker v. MERS.
MERS lost. Going from paper to electronic lost.
The court found “that [MERS and MERSCORP] are declared to be obligated to create and record written documents memorializing the transfers of debt/promissory notes which are secured by real estate mortgages in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for all such debt transfers past, present and future in the Office for the Recording of Deeds in the County where such property is situate.”
Marie McDonnell of McDonnell Analytics, a forensic mortgage analyst, certified fraud examiner, and an expert witness in Becker v. MERS, said: “If the HFPA proposal becomes law, it will make the theft of real estate in America as easy as pushing a button.”
Another MERS defeat was recently decided in Bank of America v. Greenleaf. MERS was told it does not have the power to assign mortgages in Maine.
Breetz, the HFPA Chair, pointed out there have also been rulings in MERS favor which is true, and said while he has been accused of doing the bidding of the bankers that was not the case.
“We have extended the normal drafting time from 2 years to a third year because of the significance of the issues you raised and many others, and because of the controversy within the mortgage industry and homeowners.”
Breetz also said, “I think we have an enormously dangerous system as it is now.”
The Bankers’ MERS Money Making Scheme
Baxter, who has been with the NY Federal Reserve in his current position since 1995, recognized in his letter to Breetz that MERS was created “to make [the] “securitization process” more efficient and less cumbersome” for the bankers.
That’s true. Banks do not make giant profits on individual homes but they wildly cash in when mortgages are securitized, turned into residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and traded at lightning speed at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).
The DTCC’s depository provides custody and asset servicing for more than 3.6 million securities issues from the United States and 121 other countries and territories, valued at US$36.5 trillion, according to their website. As Business Insider and CNN reported in 2012, when the DTCC’s state of the art vaults failed and were flooded during hurricane Sandy in Lower Manhattan at 55 Water Street, trillions of stock certificates and other paper securities were damaged.
The DTCC reopened for business the next day “electronically.”
Despite court rulings finding MERS acted illegally, Baxter claims that the real problem is that the Nineteenth century laws needed to be modernized and rewritten.
“What exists does not allow MERS to address other problems, like the fact the legacy legal infrastructure locks us into a Nineteenth century paper-based world, where the written form is almost considered sacred,” he wrote, “It also holds the secondary mortgage market, a national market hostage to local variation in real property law.”
Breetz believes the Federal Reserve’s strategy for a national electronic registry is the correct path, because, “like it or not” we are in the modern age and we can’t go back and undo what has already happened but correct it for the future. Breetz honestly believes that ‘going electronic’ is not the problem.
“It all depends on how it is done,” Breetz said, “Electronics could do a lot to solve at least some of the problems.”
The issue here is multi-fold.
First, most homeowners did not know when they bought their homes their mortgages would be securitized by the bankers. Now, as a result of the fraud that occurred during the securitization process—the electronic transfer of their chain of titles, homeowners cannot determine who their lenders are.
“During the mortgage securitization frenzy, original notes were destroyed after they were scanned into a digital image. Now anything on that image can be altered. The image can be duplicated and transferred electronically to any number of recipients instantly regardless of any type of so-called security. But like a scanned dollar bill, the electronic data has no tangible value. At best, the possessor can only allege the image is the original, but without the original, there is no way to be certain,” Wright said.
The results have been devastating—illegal bank foreclosures across the country and worthless, junk RMBS. The repercussions are so vast that pension companies and countries who invested in them lost—big time.
And despite the carnage, no one has gone to jail for the fraud that contributed to the 2008 economic collapse that continues to hurt innocent homeowners today.
Given that Baxter’s justification is the need to keep a “secondary mortgage market” open for business, at minimum homeowners should be given an option as to whether or not their mortgages may be securitized— up-front, in bold lettering; not buried somewhere in fine print that few people read.
Borrowing from Baxter, homeowners should be able to choose whether or not they want to be held hostage to the bankers again in another national electronic registry as part of their lucrative money making “secondary mortgage market.”
Truth be told; the fraud, illegal foreclosures, and toxic, worthless RMBS would not have happened if paper mortgage documents were properly recorded. This is what the banks do not want people to see because the bankers make a financial killing off the securitized mortgages. Most homeowners simply wanted to buy a house.
Is the NY Fed exerting undue influence on the ULC and American homeowners? If so, there appears to be a pattern. Yesterday Congressman Scott Garrett (R-NJ) questioned the NY Fed role in U.S. regulatory risk panel.
Glass Steagall
Banks became casinos after the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was repealed under President Bill Clinton with the help of a Republican Congress. Since the Great Depression, Glass-Steagall kept traditional banks and banking separate from the high-risk investment banks known today as the “too big to fail” banks.
As I previously reported, politicians like Senator Charles “Chuck” Schumer (D-NY) warned against repealing Glass-Steagall for that very reason until he supported it, and his own warnings became a destructive reality.
Other politicians like Senator Elizabeth Warren want Glass-Steagall reinstated and modernized.
Baxter believes these law reforms are in America’s national interests. “Obviously an effort to introduce Federal legislation in support of a national electronic mortgage and mortgage note transfer system is a very ambitious effort,” he wrote.
“I believe that this is also an opportune time to contemplate complementary Federal legislation that would introduce a legal infrastructure that supports a movement away from paper …These ideas have the promise of making these markets more efficient and remedy some of the root problems that make the current system vulnerable to criticism and possible abuse, “ Baxter’s letter states.
The big question that nobody seems able to answer is why would a new national electronic registry potentially governed by the Fed bank not have the same problems as MERS which was also owned by the banks?
When I contacted Baxter for his thoughts on the ULC’s HFPA draft, the NY Fed’s Media Relations office said, “Thank you for the email. Mr. Baxter will not have any additional comments at this time.”
While Baxter says, his views do not “officially” represent the position of the Federal Reserve he granted that his views became “more informed following close consultation” with his “Federal Reserve colleagues.” He offered their assistance because the Federal Reserve has worked with uniform law and Congress to enact legislation in the past.
As he wrote, “One example was when they “reformed” UCC Article in the “Check Clearing in the 21st century Act” which allowed checks themselves to be electronified.”
For Breetz’s part, to his credit, he said that he has agreed to have some homeowners who are fighting the banks observe ULC’s meeting on HFPA in Seattle this Friday.
To help him draft HFPA, Breetz said what he needed but was unable to locate were reported cases that he could cite to the other lawyers which prove how the “bad guys” were able to foreclose on homes where the debt had already been paid off.
“These types of cases were easiest to justify a change in law— showing there was no, “he said, she said” to the facts.”
Within hours of contacting a couple homeowners I knew who are fighting the bankers in court, Breetz had plenty of cases to choose from.
Sometimes people do not understand the damage the unaccountable mortgage fraud has caused America and beyond until it happens to them.

Update: According to an attorney for a number of homeowners throughout the country, who was at the ULC’s meeting and rally in Seattle, William Breetz kept his word and met with a group of them after the conference. She reported that HFPA Drafting Committee Chairman Breetz appeared to be sincere and seemed very interested in some of what homeowners and their representatives had to say. Chairman Breetz has scheduled another meeting with some Washington State homeowners and their representatives on Tuesday, July 15, 2014 in Seattle. The ULC Drafting Committee will meet again in Chicago in November, 2014.
It is my understanding that HFPA is a year away from becoming law. In what form remains to be seen. Now is the time for homeowners to weigh in and make their voices known to the ULC, all the bankers and especially the Federal Reserve.

Resources for homeowners facing illegal foreclosures who want to fight the bankers
There are scores of homeowners nationwide who have been fighting the bankers in court for years—many pro se. As a result of their efforts, they are not only pushing back against the bankers but have amassed an abundant amount of information and resources for all homeowners to use (free and paid) to join the court battles and restore the rule of law.
Do your own research and follow the best route for your circumstances. Below are some mortgage fraud websites to help get you started. Some of the owners I’ve spoken with directly, other websites came highly recommended. They are in no particular order.

Comprehensive Roundup: Foreclosure and Mortgage Information
Update: Now for some good news… Do not lose heart. Not to speak is to speak, not to act is to act. In true David and Goliath fashion, it is everyday Americans making a difference and taking the masks off the bankers. Individual Americans are taking on the banks in courts across the country and fighting to expose and clean up the fraud in America’s economy.
In addition to the aforementioned homeowner court wins there are more. For instance, in Deutsche Bank v. Harrison, Deutsche Bank’s case falls to pieces and another homeowner sees justice.
“The witness admitted Ocwen had no involvement in the mortgage loan whatsoever for the first nine (9) years of the loan since 2004. She testified she had no knowledge of the prior servicer’s business records as she had never worked for them. The court finds that there was a break in the chain of assignments of mortgage contained in the court file.”

CPAC at the Bridge
by Michelle Malkin
Delivered March 1, 2019
Good afternoon. Thank you to CPAC for the invitation. My name is Michelle Malkin. I identify as an American. A proud, unhyphenated, unapologetic, fully assimilated American. My pronouns are U.S.A.
America is good and America is great. Of these basic truths, there is or should be little dispute among us here. But two questions loom large: 1) For how long will the America we grew up in remain good and great? And 2) To whom shall we entrust the existential responsibility of securing the goodness and greatness passed down peacefully for generations?
I wish I could stand here and chirp happily to you about positive news. Yes, unemployment rates are at historic lows, regulations and taxes are being cut, some stellar judges have been confirmed, and the reckless, feckless liberal media has finally, finally self-immolated like a slow-motion downing of the Hindenburg.
Yes, we have much to thank President Trump for as he battles the Beltway swamp, the deep state, the administrative state, and the fake news fourth estate. But there is no sugarcoating America’s long-term forecast. We face fearful odds. The game is rigged. The playing field is manifestly unlevel.
My first book Invasion in 2002, exposed how border failures and systemic non-enforcement of our visa program rules created a national security crisis that led to 9/11. My last book, Sold Out, which I co-authored in 2015 with former American computer programmer-turned-labor lawyer John Miano, documented how Big Business and Big Government created an economic crisis by exploiting the H-1B tech worker visa program and other foreign employment visas for cheap labor. I’ve been accused of being a grifter for wanting to inform and educate citizens about these destructive rackets. But it’s the GOP sellouts in bed with open borders – like the ones who hijacked the tea party movement to shill for amnesty – who are the real grifters cashing in and practicing deceit at the expense of their base.
Our shining city on a hill has become a much-abused doormat to the world. Building the border wall is just half the battle. The numbers tell all. Our future is dimmed. The odds are fearful.
We currently grant one million legal permanent residencies to people from around the world every year. The number of green card holders is expected to increase by 10 million by 2025. That’s more than the current combined population of Dallas, St. Louis, Denver, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Now multiply that number by at least three and a half. Thanks to our chain migration system, created in 1952 and expanded exponentially by Congress in 1965 and 1990, these new immigrants can sponsor their entire extended families: parents, spouses, adult children and their children, and siblings and their children. Princeton University researchers found that recently admitted immigrants sponsored an average of 3.45 additional relatives each.
An estimated 85,000 refugees and 20,000-plus asylees enter the country annually through an overwhelmed system so rife with fraud and abuse that the process is jokingly dubbed “refugee roulette” by immigration lawyers. In total, from fiscal year 2008 to 2017, the U.S. gave green cards to more than 2 million migrants for various humanitarian claims – a population larger than the city of Philadelphia.
Nearly half a million more immigrants in that time frame got in through the diversity visa lottery. Illegal aliens are eligible if a legal family member wins the jackpot. Tens of thousands are pouring in from terrorism breeding grounds through the lottery unvetted, unmonitored and unassimilated. Thanks again to chain migration, immigration lotto winners’ spouses and unmarried children under 21 all get passes into the country, too.
Nearly half of all illegal aliens in the country have violated the terms of their short-term visitor or work visas. More than 10.8 million people received such visas alone in fiscal year 2015, including 500,000 foreign university and graduate students on academic visas and nearly 700,000 total foreign guest workers (both skilled and unskilled, not to mention their spouses, many of whom are allowed to work here as well).
Congress has repeatedly mandated a nationwide visa entry-exit system to track legal short-term visa holders. But one has yet to be built—even in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which were perpetrated in part by several illegal alien visa overstayers. E-verify has been stalled. Sanctuary cities metastasized. And BOTH parties are to blame – yeah I’m looking at you, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the Bush family, Mitt Romney and the ghost of John McCain.
This unrelenting inflow of new green card holders, short-term foreign visa holders, legal temporary workers, refugees and asylees is supplemented by 13 to 30 million illegal aliens who expect amnesty and chain migration privileges from Washington despite breaking immigration laws governing everything from border jumping to ID fraud, benefits fraud, tax fraud, and marriage fraud, to human and drug trafficking, to employment rules, deportation orders, and visa overstays.
The feds have proved themselves serially unwilling and incapable of handling the lapses, backlogs, overload, and yes, invasion. The numbers tell all. Open borders anarchy, multiplied by endless chain migration, amnesty, and cheap labor pipelines, endangers our general welfare and the blessings of liberty. By every clear measure, the war is not on immigrants but on American sovereignty.
I’ve been called white for stating the facts. I’m not white. I’m just right. Both native-born and immigrant families like mine, which revere the rule of law, common traditions, constitutional principles, one identity and one tongue, have been replaced by militantly unassimilable and hostile generations…of future Democrat voters whose tribal allegiance to the Left has only hardened over time. It’s insane that we have elected Republicans on Capitol Hill doing the bidding of the illegal alien DREAMer racket. Until and unless we reclaim the right of self-determination over the numbers, we are doomed.
My fellow Americans, we stand at the bridge as Horatius stood at the narrow bridge over the Tiber River alone facing fearful odds as hordes of Etruscans marched towards him and cowards cut and run behind him. Like his enemies, our enemies are both foreign AND domestic.
Inside are flimsily defended borders, we are not at peace, or rather, the radical Left is not at peace with us. From the comfort of TV green rooms, Beltway backrooms, corporate boardrooms, and conference ballrooms, it may not look like civil war is imminent. But threats and outright violence against ordinary, law-abiding people are now regularized features, not random bugs, of political life in these dis-United States. College students are being punched, elderly citizens are being harassed, MAGA hat wearers are being kicked off planes and assaulted in school hallways and restaurants, conservative speakers are being mobbed and Molotov cocktailed, ICE agents and their families are being targeted, pro-lifers are being kicked and menaced, pro-Trump, anti-jihad moms on social media are being monitored and doxxed. The madness is beyond parody. Last week, social justice media warriors whipped up hysteria over a Mar a Lago pastry chef’s Instagram posts. Where are the sanctuary spaces for law-abiding conservatives who simply want to exercise their rights to free speech and peaceable assembly?
The divide in this country is between decent people who stand up for America and dastardly people who want to bring America to its knees.
We certainly should make common cause with others across the aisle who shares our values, but we should not rush to embrace those whose fundamental aim is to smear and destroy us all. That’s suicidal. Which is why I cannot stand here and stay silent about the role Van Jones has played in attempting to silence the Right. My objection is not to his support for criminal justice reform. I have dedicated much of my own time, energy, and money to fighting wrongful convictions, false allegations, and prosecutorial and forensic misconduct. Next time you need a conservative to talk about criminal justice reform, call me. You don’t need someone who’s going to spew fake news pro illegal alien propaganda to talk CJR to conservatives.
Fact check: The most recent research by the Federation for American Immigration Reform found that illegal aliens are up to 5.5 times more likely than Americans to be incarcerated in state prisons compared to Americans and legal residents.
But my most vehement objection is to this stage being used to lend legitimacy to the George Soros-funded organization Color of Change, which dedicated to censoring and sabotaging right-leaning groups for championing the free market, opposing radical Islam, and exposing open borders.
Seven years ago, Van Jones’ group pressured Pepsi, McDonald’s, Intuit and other companies to cut ties to the mainstream American Legislative Exchange Council(ALEC), a half-century-old association of state legislators who believe in “the Jeffersonian principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty.” What was ALEC’s crime? Crafting model legislation on voter ID to protect election integrity, immigration enforcement measures and self-defense legislation to strengthen Second Amendment rights.
Color of Change and the smear machine racket known as the Southern Poverty Law Center use the same playbook to marginalize and criminalize mainstream conservatives, anti-jihad groups, and immigration hawks as “hate groups” and push us out of the public square. They conspire with payment processors and Silicon Valley to deprive the Right of our voices and our ability to make a living. So many speaking up and fighting on the front lines for liberty and security are being detwittered depaypaled defacebooked deplatformed – people like Laura Loomer and Gavin McInnes and the Center for Immigration Studies and Robert Spencer and so many others. Many are in this room. Stand up if you are one of them. Many have been forced to beg for money to help them fight in court to restore their reputations. Many have been barred from this room.
Nice is not enough. Logic and facts and appeals to decency and fairness are not enough. Bemoaning double standards is not enough. Ultimately our future will not be secured in a Fox News anchor chair or a think tank office or on a cruise ship or at a cushy GOP retreat. The future is on the frontlines. At the edge of the bridge.
Then out spake brave Horatius, the captain of the Gate. To every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late. And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his Gods.
Instead of throwing allies under that bridge, movement conservatives who have preached so comfortably here in the Beltway about defending America while preserving the status quo need to help provide financial and moral support to the disrupters willing to fight fire with fire. Maybe it’s providence that I am privileged to speak here on the 7th anniversary of Andrew Breitbart’s death. He was a disrupter. We need more disrupters. We need legislative action at the local and state level. We need politicians who will DO SOMETHING to stop the sowers of hate and their handmaidens. Use the tools at your disposal. Don’t just stand there. DO SOMETHING.
Diversity is NOT our strength. Unity is. Our common purpose is the common defense of our nation. Good people make America great. Good people: Stand and fight.

Correctional Institutions
Jails, prisons, work camps and similar correctional facilities are included in this feature. Homebuyers and renters are typically interested in this data because they fear an increase in criminal activity such as burglaries, muggings, etc in areas near a correctional facility. Real estate values around correctional institutions also tend to be lower than in similar neighborhoods.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Daycares
Frequently, it is useful for parents to have a daycare center close to their home and this feature shows where the various registered daycares are located around the community.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Fire Stations
Fire stations are relevant because distance from one typically has some effect on response time.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Hospitals
Distance from a hospital can be important for persons with special medical conditions, the elderly, and the general population. Note that this is not a complete inventory of hospitals throughout the state; as such, additional medical facilities may be located in a community which are not shown by this feature.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Law Enforcement
The distance a residence is from the nearest law enforcement facility typically has an effect on response time to an incident. This may be an important factor for some renters or homebuyers. Facilities include police and sheriff’s departments, highway patrol stations, Florida Department of Law Enforcement substations and offices, and various other Federal offices/stations.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Public Parks
This feature depicts the locations of parks by type (beach, county-park, wildlife conservation area, etc) for the entire state. The map is made up of points, so it doesn't show how big the park actually is, but it is useful for people who want to know what specific kinds of parks are near their potential home. For instance, a person who wants to live near a golf course or a boat ramp would want to look at this feature.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Public Schools (Elementary, Middle and High Schools)
This feature shows not only the locations of public schools, but also the quality. Quality is assessed using the state of Florida’s Accountability Report, where each school is given a grade of A, B, C, D, or F. An "A" means the school did very well on the State's assessment whereas an "F" indicates it did very poorly. A school's grade is based primarily on its students' performance on the FCAT (which measures performance in reading, math, writing and science).

This feature illustrates shopping centers throughout the state. A "shopping center" commonly includes supermarket plazas, malls, etc.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Dumps and Landfills
As you might have guessed, this feature includes facilities such as landfills, trash incineration plants, recycling centers etc. Homebuyers and renters are interested in where solid waste treatment facilities are located because real estate values tend to be lower around them. Additionally, people living near some of these centers may experience higher truck traffic, aversive odors and other problems. Occasionally groundwater and soil contamination from seepage around landfills can occur.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Federal Toxic Waste Treatment Sites (SUPERFUND)
Federal Toxic Waste Treatment Sites also known as SUPERFUND sites are areas where the environmental contamination (due to hazardous wastes such as PCBs, dioxin, lead, mercury, etc) is bad enough that the federal government has to step in and take charge of site cleanup. These areas are typically fairly toxic and commonly have some soil or groundwater contamination present. These sites are more common than one might think and are of interest to anyone, but especially homebuyers who may want to rely on a well for their drinking water.

Colleges & Universities
Depicts the locations of community colleges, four year universities and vocational schools. Homebuyers are typically interested in this feature if they are planning on really settling in an area. The presence of a major university in community can indicate better educational and recreational opportunities along with more annoyances due to traffic, noise, parties, etc. Neighborhoods surrounding such a school can be expected to have a higher proportion of renters.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Marinas

Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Dry Cleaning Facilities
Most dry cleaning facilities in the United States use a chemical solvent called perchloroethylene to clean their garments. While having one close by can be convenient, living right next door to one might not be the best idea. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), short term exposure to this chemical can cause temporary impairment of the central nervous system. Long term exposure can cause liver damage, kidney damage, and possibly cancer. Fortunately, the chemical typically doesn't travel too far due to its volatility (tendency to evaporate quickly) . Perchloroethylene can also contaminate soil and groundwater if improperly handled.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Hotels
This feature shows all of the long and short stay hotels in the area.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Air Emissions Facilities
Facilities that are discharging some type of pollutant into the air and are regulated by the U.S. EPA. Most if not all of these facilities are completely law abiding and are not doing anything wrong, however, they are discharging some type of pollution into the atmosphere and as such, are regulated. Typical examples are electric power plants, factories, universities and the like. For regulatory purposes, air pollution is broadly defined; as such you will likely see a large number of air pollution points. Most of these are fairly mundane.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Petroleum Contamination
Areas that have been contaminated by a petroleum leak. These sites are extremely common in Florida and typically result from leaking storage tanks at gas stations or diesel generator locations.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Hazardous Substance Handlers
These are facilities regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Essentially the places in this feature are businesses that produce, transport, recycle, or otherwise handle some sort of hazardous chemical or material. Most if not all of these facilities are completely law abiding and are not doing anything wrong, however, they do handle materials classified as hazardous.
Want more information or have additional questions? Check out our FAQ or Extended Map Feature Descriptions.
x
Veterans Facilities
The locations of recreational, organizational, and medical veteran's facilities throughout the state are depicted. Clicking on a point will reveal its address and other contact information.

Kaneka enhances its biodegradable plastic manufacturing capacity
Kaneka Biodegradable Polymer PHBH is now actively getting applied to fruits and vegetable bags or compost bags in Europe
Kaneka Corporation (Headquarters: Minato-ku, Tokyo; President: Mamoru Kadokura) has determined to expand a manufacturing facility (Takasago Manufacturing Site) of biodegradable polymer (Product name: Kaneka Biodegradable Polymer PHBH). The production capacity will be about 5,000 ton per year with an investment amount of 2.5 billion yen and will begin operating in December 2019.
“Kaneka Biodegradable Polymer PHBH”, which is derived from 100% plants and has superior biodegradability, is now actively getting applied to fruits and vegetable bags or compost*1 bags in Europe where the restrictions have been tightened to reduce disposal plastic bags, contributing to the increase in sales. Furthermore, while microplastics*2 pollution emerges as a global concern, PHBH is not only certified*3 as biodegradable in seawater, but also registered as “Food Contact Substance*4” from FDA*5 in March this year. We expect increase in demand for a wide application of PHBH such as to sea material or food package in the future.
Global demand for biodegradable plastic*6 is predicted to be over a million ton in 2022 with huge market expansion. By the manufacturing capacity reinforcement of this time, Kaneka will establish a production facility which meets rapidly growing demands and at the same time develop further applications. For the next step, we have collaterally started considering a commercial plant with production capacity of 20,000 ton per year to realize the full-scale business expansion.
Example uses of “Kaneka Biodegradable Polymer PHBH” (Source: Kaneka)
*1 A processing method to decompose organic matter like garbage by the work of microorganisms into compost, or compost thereof.
*2 Fine plastic trash (less than 5 mm). The impact on ecosystems of the contained or absorbed chemical matter entering the food chain arises much concern. It is said that they generate from microbeads or plastic products used for scrub contained in face-wash or toothpaste which are crashed into pieces of less than 5 mm in the natural environment.
*3 Kaneka acquired the “OK Biodegradable MARINE” certificate in September 2017 from Vincotte, an international certification organization based in Belgium. Vincotte succeeded certification service to TÜV AUSTRIA Belgium NV in December 2017.
*4 Material which is used as a ingredient formulated to manufacture, package, wrap, transport or preserve food, and is evaluated its risk based on the actual amount of exposure to the applied food and is certified by EDA that it has no significant effect in use.
*5 A governmental organization of U.S. in charge of approval or conformity control of products which consumers have contact with in daily life, such as food or medicine in addition to cosmetics, clinical instrument, animal drug or toy.
*6 Estimated by Kaneka according to European Bioplastics, an industrial organization specialized in bioplastic matter in Europe.

Trump Delays Speech Until Government Shutdown Ends
0 Comment
Jan 24 2019 By AFP	
Angela Weiss—AFP
U.S. president submits to top Democrat Nancy Pelosi’s demand, agreeing to ‘do the Address when the shutdown is over’
U.S. President Donald Trump backed down late Wednesday in a spat with Democrats over his State of the Union address, agreeing to delay it until a government shutdown ends, although the more than month-long impasse dragged on.
The U.S. Senate prepared meanwhile on Thursday to hold two showdown votes on measures to reopen the shuttered federal agencies, but Trump’s toxic sparring with House speaker Nancy Pelosi essentially assured no solution was at hand.
An intensifying war of words between the president and Pelosi came to a head on Wednesday with the top Democrat effectively blocking Trump from delivering his annual address in Congress until the partial government shutdown, now in its 34th day, is brought to an end. But in a tweet sent after 11:00 p.m., Trump wrote: “As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative—I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over.”
As acrimony in Washington grew, lawmakers across the political spectrum were left searching in vain for an exit strategy for the longest-ever halt to federal operations, as furloughed government employees and contractors vented their fury on Capitol Hill.
The prospects for Trump getting to deliver his national address in Congress next Tuesday as planned were dim, with the Senate votes—one on Trump’s proposal that includes money for his border wall and changes to immigration policy, the other by Democrats seeking to reopen government before negotiating border security—bound to fail.
Traditionally the president’s annual speech is delivered before a joint session of Congress in the ornate chamber of the House of Representatives.
In an effort to force the hand of Pelosi, who had already urged Trump to reschedule due to shutdown-related security shortcomings, the president wrote to her saying it would be “so very sad for our Country” if his speech could not be delivered on time and in the chamber.
Pelosi, who has become the face of Democratic opposition to Trump in Congress, pushed back, informing the president that the House would only agree to host him for his speech “when government has been opened.”
Trump now appears to have capitulated.
After his tweet late on Wednesday agreeing to delay his speech, Pelosi tweeted back saying she hopes he agrees to a deal that opens the government.
The shutdown, which has seen some 800,000 federal employees left without pay for a month, was triggered by Trump’s refusal to sign funding bills in December, in retaliation for Democratic opposition to funds for extending walls along the U.S.-Mexico border.
With the closure of about one quarter of federal agencies affecting millions of Americans, hundreds of unpaid government workers used the power of protest to publicize their plight, holding a sit-in for hours at a congressional office building. Some held up paper plates with messages including “Will work for pay.”
With no solution in sight, many were bracing for Friday, when they expect to miss their second paycheck in a row.
The House, now controlled by Democrats, has passed multiple bills that would open government, but the Republican-run Senate is aligned with Trump’s push for border wall funding.
The Senate votes have the potential to break the impasse, but since each requires 60 votes to advance in the 100-member chamber, their passage is unlikely. With both sides locked in their positions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the chamber “it’s time to make a deal.”
Even the Senate’s chaplain Barry Black took the rare step of weighing in, somberly intoning in his opening prayer on Wednesday that “as some members of our armed forces seek sustenance at charity food pantries, and prepare to miss a second pay day, something has to give.”
Trump says he will not reopen government before his wall funding comes through.
Most Democrats oppose direct funds for wall construction, but some have begun publicly advocating for negotiating a solution that includes boosted border funding, including for border structures. “Look, I think physical barriers are part of the solution,” congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, told Fox News. “We want to make sure that people who come into the United States are authorized to do so,” he added. “We’re for border security and I think we can get there.”
Government shutdowns are a disruptive political ritual that have occurred in various administrations and are almost unique to the American system. This one is the longest on record, and has left a broad swath of federal workers unpaid—among them airport security officers, FBI agents, museum workers and U.S. Coast Guard personnel.

Plant soil interactions alter carbon cycling in an upland grassland soil

Abstract/Summary
Soil carbon (C) storage is dependent upon the complex dynamics of fresh and native organic matter cycling, which are regulated by plant and soil-microbial activities. A fundamental challenge exists to link microbial biodiversity with plant-soil C cycling processes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating soil carbon. To address this, we contrasted vegetated grassland soils with bare soils, which had been plant-free for 3 years, using stable isotope (13C) labeled substrate assays and molecular analyses of bacterial communities. Vegetated soils had higher C and N contents, biomass, and substrate-specific respiration rates. Conversely, following substrate addition unlabeled, native soil C cycling was accelerated in bare soil and retarded in vegetated soil; indicative of differential priming effects. Functional differences were reflected in bacterial biodiversity with Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria dominating vegetated and bare soils, respectively. Significant isotopic enrichment of soil RNA was found after substrate addition and rates varied according to substrate type. However, assimilation was independent of plant presence which, in contrast to large differences in 13CO2 respiration rates, indicated greater substrate C use efficiency in bare, Acidobacteria-dominated soils. Stable isotope probing (SIP) revealed most community members had utilized substrates with little evidence for competitive outgrowth of sub-populations. Our findings support theories on how plant-mediated soil resource availability affects the turnover of different pools of soil carbon, and we further identify a potential role of soil microbial biodiversity. Specifically we conclude that emerging theories on the life histories of dominant soil taxa can be invoked to explain changes in soil carbon cycling linked to resource availability, and that there is a strong case for considering microbial biodiversity in future studies investigating the turnover of different pools of soil carbon.

National Wildlife Federation Action Fund - House Candidate Schwartz Commits to Support of Public Lands
House Candidate Schwartz Commits to Support of Public Lands
Thursday, October 27, 2016
By: Judith Kohler
National Wildlife Federation Seeks Bipartisan Endorsement of Keeping Public Lands Public
DENVER (Oct. 27, 2016) – The National Wildlife Federation announced Thursday that Gail Schwartz, the challenger in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District race, has officially endorsed its statement of principles that seeks support from political leaders to keep public lands in public hands.
The National Wildlife Federation and its state affiliates have asked congressional and legislative candidates across the nation, if they are elected, to oppose large-scale sales or transfers of public lands or attempts to undermine the management of lands that belong to all Americans. Forty-two sportsmen’s organizations from across the country, including the Colorado Wildlife Federation and the National Wildlife Federation, also sent letters to the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns, as well as the other presidential candidates, seeking the same commitments.
The National Wildlife Federation has yet to receive a response from the campaign of Scott Tipton, the incumbent in the 3rd District, but will continue seeking one.
Sportsmen’s and conservation organizations stress the importance of bipartisan support for public lands. A small but vocal group of lawmakers at the state and federal levels is trying to dismantle the public-lands heritage built over more than a century by Americans from across the political spectrum.
“Defending America’s public lands shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Our public-lands heritage was built by leaders of both parties. People of all backgrounds enjoy our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, waterways and backcountry,” said Collin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund. “Working to protect our public-lands legacy and all it contributes to our nation’s economy, health and well-being is a great antidote for the divisiveness that has afflicted politics and our public discourse.”
In Colorado, public lands help drive an outdoor recreation industry that annually generates $34.5 billion in economic activity and supports 313,000 jobs. A bipartisan poll released earlier this year by Colorado College found that 77 percent of Colorado voters believe national public lands contribute to the state economy and a majority of voters of all affiliations say a candidate’s stance on conservation matters.
And amid the controversy over public lands, state lawmakers this year passed a law creating an annual Colorado Public Lands Day.
“A lot of us live in Colorado for the hiking, rafting, fishing, hunting, skiing, camping and the chance to see wildlife, from bighorn sheep to herds of elk streaming over hills,” said Bill Dvorak, the National Wildlife Federation’s public-lands organizer and Colorado’s first licensed rafting outfitter. “A majority of Coloradans spend time out on public lands. What we have here is special and we need political leaders to work with us to keep it that way by defeating attempts to sell or remove public lands from public hands.”

Trump Tells Neocons to Fuck Off. It Ain’t Your Party Anymore	
May 6, 2016
ELDER PATRIOT – The neocons who have run the Republican Party since they seized control of it after Ronald Reagan left office threw a hissy fit yesterday as many of them refused to endorse Donald Trump insisting they own the party, not the voters.
George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Mitt Romney have all stated their intentions to boycott the party’s convention this summer. Really, who cares? Under their guidance the party has been complicit in running up $20 trillion dollars in debt, bankrupting social security and Medicare, out-sourcing millions of American jobs, encouraging corporate inversions, creating dependence on government, and engaging in endless wars.
Perhaps most damaging to our republic has been their embrace of virtually limitless and unregulated immigration that is resulting in the Balkanization of our society. These bastions of the neocon movement profess fidelity to the Constitution while at the same time inviting new voters into our country who have no idea what that document means, don’t embrace it, and overwhelmingly vote to dismantle it.
Word to the ex and wannabe presidents: Before Trump entered this race the Republican Party didn’t have a single candidate capable of defeating Hillary Clinton. Your embrace of the globalist agenda allowed the Democrats to win elections solely on social issues so that the American people were facing the prospect of a Democrat inhabiting the White House for 24 of the past 36 years by 2024. Under your leadership conservatism became synonymous with globalism and corporatism. Now, thanks to Donald Trump Americans can now close this sad chapter in our nation’s history.
Trump dismissed these failed leaders when he said, “it would be nice to unify the party but it’s not necessary.” Trump will gladly trade the votes of a couple hundred thousand strident crybabies for the millions of new voters he’s bringing to the Republican Party.
But the biggest slap at Trump came yesterday when Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he wasn’t prepared to endorse the people’s choice to be their party’s presidential nominee. Can you imagine? Ryan has led the Congress to an 11% approval rating and he wants to dictate terms to the man who, if voter counts are the barometer, is the most popular Republican candidate in the history of the party.
During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper Ryan was asked if, after months of saying he would support the party’s nominee would he now support Donald Trump? Ryan answered: “Well, to be perfectly candid with you, Jake, I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party. And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.”
It appears Ryan’s inflated view of his importance has him expecting the future president to court him. It also appears that Donald trump has no intention of kowtowing to the Speaker as he made clear in a statement that he issued in response:
“I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan’s agenda. Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that is about time for politicians to put them first!”
Ryan’s appeal is limited to the First Congressional District in Wisconsin and even there he is facing a primary challenge by a local businessman. Ryan couldn’t even deliver his home state in 2012 when he shared the ticket with Romney running to be the V.P.
Trump has correctly read the mood of the electorate and has been willing to spend his own money to redefine and realign the Republican Party so that it is in line with the interests of the citizens. He has not hesitated to prove his willingness to challenge the party’s establishment and throw them overboard if they insist on continuing to screw the people he is coming to represent.
Every indication is that Trump is prepared to craft his agenda around the wants and needs of the people who have voted for him. It’s becoming evident that he has no intention of lording over them as the party he now leads has become accustomed to doing.
We may finally a presidential candidate who says what he means and means what he says about putting the American people first.

HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM
“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas Jefferson
ELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.
Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.
Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.
Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”
Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?
After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.
So, what gives?
Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”
As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”
The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.
Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.
One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.
Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.
Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.
These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.
No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.
So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.
And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.
Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.
EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.
HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP
“Impeach!” It’s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama’s administration – but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it’s back with a vengeance.
Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “I” word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”
Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.
Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America’s new Richard Nixon.
“Watergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. “Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I’m not going to stop asking them.”
Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.
The posters read: “If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. … Resign now.”
But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?
At this time, there’s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.
“The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,” Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:
For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.
However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.
A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”
However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.

Protect Groundwater from New Bottled Water Permits
Water is a basic human right but, with a new provincial government that believes Ontario is open for business, access to water for the common person just became that much more precarious.
By Doreen Nicoll
Published November 02, 2018
Before November 30, let the Ontario Ministry of Environment Conservation and Parks know you agree with their proposed extension to the current moratorium on new permits to take groundwater for bottled water.
For over 15 years, Nestlé has been extracting water for profit in Wellington county. Wellington Water Watchers (WWW) campaign Water for Life, Not Profit maintains that water should be treated as a commons, not a commodity to be bought and sold on the world market.
WWW is focused on Nestlé because Nestlé is the only corporation bottling water in Wellington County, and it's not only seeking to expand its water-mining but is by far the largest water bottler in Ontario. Nestlé currently has two expired permits for wells in Aberfoyle and Hillsburgh but continues extracting a total maximum of 4.7 million litres per day. In addition, it purchased a well in Middlebrook and hopes to secure a permit for that site as well.
Despite recent droughts affecting local residents and farmers in Wellington County, Nestlé made headlines in September 2016 when it outbid the community of Elora and purchased a third well in Middlebrook to expand production from its existing Aberfoyle and Hillsburgh extraction sites.
Guelph is one of the largest Canadian cities to rely almost exclusively on groundwater for its drinking water supply. That puts the Aberfoyle plant in direct competition with the needs of residents. In fact, a City of Guelph report released at the end of October 2016, exposed Nestlé's water extraction will come into conflict with Guelph's water needs within two decades.
WWW believe water is for life not for profit. This non-profit organization primarily run by volunteer citizens from Guelph-Wellington is committed to protecting local water and educating the public about threats to watersheds throughout Ontario.
Ontario bottlers like Nestlé were paying $3.71 per million litres for the water drawn from local aquifers. In 2017, the Wynne government increased that cost to $503.71 per million litres in an attempt to try to recover permit costs. But, basically, water extracted by Nestlé is essentially free when compared to the cost to consumers for each 500 ml. bottle.
Nestlé Waters Canada currently has permits to extract 4.7 million litres per day of groundwater in Wellington Country. Nestlé wants to increase this by an additional 1.6 million litres per day. That water leaves local watersheds, never returns and so interferes with local access to drinking water. This hasn't even accounted for the plastic waste that ends up in landfills or as litter.
As WWW Chair Mike Nagy points out, "Even if fees are very high, it does not create more clean water. There is only so much to go around. Not one single drop more has been produced since the world began. All we do is simply transform water into different states and we contaminate it. But, the bigger concern is the huge carbon footprint of bottled water production and transportation."
WWW believes water is a basic human right but, with a new provincial government that believes Ontario is open for business, access to water for the common person just became that much more precarious.
This is not just about one corporation's insatiable demand for our water, it is also about strengthening provincial regulations in order to help protect water across this beautiful province, the country and around the world.
Here's the link to Ontario Environment Conservation and Parks survey.

If you check on line, the bottled water industry sells 2.4 billion litres of water per year (2013) or 68 litres per Canadian. I don't like the packaging, and if it is lowering the water level at the local aquifer this isn't good. Otherwise, the water industry is making water more accessible to more Canadians. It certainly isn't precarious. This article has a hint of NIMBY'ism to it. It's a product clearly wanted by Canadians. Canadians are paying for the production/packing/distribution/retail costs for the product, the actual water is a marginal incidental cost.People are paying for the convenience, less than 20 cents for a half litre at grocery store in bulk, or up to $3 to $5 at a convenience store. There is plenty of competition in this sector unlike the dairy industry. I try to fill a reusable container at home, especially when out hiking or walking, but there are times I am traveling and want water, not a soft drink, and I'm guilty of buying bottled water. All the water ends up back in the environment , not as much will show up in the aquifer in the Guelph area.

Canada's no-sex, no-money scandal could topple Trudeau
11/03/2019
He placed blame on an "erosion of trust" between Wilson-Raybould and Butts, though maintained that if the former attorney general had any concerns about undue pressure that it was her responsibility to bring it to his attention.
Then, in meticulous detail, she showed Canadians how official Ottawa, The Town, the nation's capital exerted relentless pressure on her to ignore her constitutional duty as attorney-general and bow to demands from the Prime Minister's Office to interfere in a bribery and corruption case involving Quebec engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin.
She said that an absolute exemption from the ban for this, or any company is not on the table at cabinet, but that because they are looking at broadening the kinds of crimes that could be captured by these rules, there should be a range in the punishment to reflect the varying types of offences.
"What I expect from all of my ministers, and from myself, and by the way it's something that Ms. Wilson-Raybould had always demonstrated as long as I've known her, is that she listens to different points of view and in the end makes her decision".
In her resignation letter, Ms Philpott said it had become "untenable" for her to continue to serve in the Cabinet.
"Previously, it was only after intense pressure that Liberal MPs on the justice committee allowed this investigation to start, and only after intense pressure from Canadians did Justin Trudeau even partially allow Ms. Wilson-Raybould to speak", Scheer said.
"I was not aware of that erosion of trust, and as prime minister and leader of the federal ministry, I should have been", he said.
Trudeau's former adviser Gerry Butts defended the prime minister yesterday in the House of Commons, telling the justice committee that "nothing happened here beyond the normal operations of government".
The opposition Conservative leader has called on Trudeau to resign.
Star-studded wedding for India's Ambani scion, World News & Top Stories
Photos on Twitter showed elaborate floral decorations and celebrities posing on a lawn before the wedding. Cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Hardik Pandya are also turning up.
Sheehan did not directly address the question of if he feels the Liberals are in for a fight as the October 21, 2019 federal election approaches.
"As we look back over the past weeks, there are many lessons to be learned and many things we would have liked to have done differently". He can not be prime minister of Canada unless he and his Quebec Liberal MPs are re-elected in the fall election.
Liberal MP Celina Caesar-Chavannes says Trudeau was angry when she told him on February 12 of her plans to announce she was not running in the October federal election.
He implied that this misunderstanding, which he said surprised him, was born of a lack of reasonableness and open-mindedness on the part of Ms. Wilson-Raybould.
Throughout the news conference, he affirmed much of Wilson-Raybould's account but cast his involvement as a pure-minded effort to protect pensioners and jobs. "As we now learn through this testimony, that was not the case", said Trudeau. Her riding is a new one, carved out of the former turf of several Vancouver ridings with a polyglot of different neighbourhoods and ethnic groups and without an established constituency infrastructure of experienced staff and voter information. "Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised", she also tweeted.
"It's not about whether deferred prosecutions are legitimate, it's about the fact that Justin Trudeau used his position of authority to intervene in a court case", he said Friday.
At the heart of the crisis are claims that Trudeau and his team pressured Canada's first indigenous attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, to cut a deal with an engineering firm from Trudeau's home province, and the implication that he demoted her when she refused.
SNC-Lavalin, which employs some 9,000 people in Canada and tens of thousands overseas, is accused of bribing Libyan officials to get contracts between 2001 and 2011.

Tucker Carlson Unapologetic Over Audio of Comments Critics Call Misogynistic
12/03/2019
Media Matters, an advocacy group, discovered the audio clips that include an interview with Tampa shock-jock host Todd Clem also known as Bubba the Love Sponge and are believed to be from 2006 and 2007.
There are a lot of awful human beings on the airwaves at Fox News, but recently uncovered audio of Tucker Carlson from 2006 to 2011 shows that he is, without a doubt, the worst person on the network.
Carlson responded on Sunday night by saying that Media Matters "caught me saying something naughty".
Media Matters president Angelo Carusone simultaneously bragged on social media that the tapes of Tucker Carlson were dropped at a time when Fox News was to host an event for their biggest advertisers. Instead, he invited anyone who disagrees with his views as expressed these days on TV to come challenge him on Tucker Carlson Tonight. He was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list for arranging child marriages.
He also made this gross comment about his own daughter, after the show hosts spoke about sexual experimentations at boarding school: "If it weren't my daughter I would love that scenario". The same goes for Tucker defending child rapists. He's like got some weird religious call where he thinks it's okay to, you know, marry underage girls, but he didn't do it.
-Aug. 27, 2009: Carlson says that if he made the laws, "Michael Vick would have been executed, and Warren Jeffs would be out on the street". "It's much more planned out and plotted", said the co-host, who wasn't identified in the transcripts.
Bubba Appearances Haunting Carlson
Donald Trump Jr. praised Tucker Carlson for braving the "outrage mob".
"I just don't think it's the same thing exactly as pulling a child from a bus stop and sexually assaulting that child", Tucker said". "I don't understand why, if you're an adult, you just can't get up and say, 'This is what the person did to me'". Carlson was a regular on Bubba's show back then.
I mean I'm talking early teens, illegal young women for older men to marry and Carlson defended it so there's nothing wrong with it. In another appearance, he implied that women like being instructed by men to "just be quiet and kind of do what you're told".
Fox News spokespeople did not respond to The Daily Beast's request for comment, nor to TPM's request. Do you believe what he has said in the past is relevant for today?
CARLSON: What do you mean an accessory? He didn't - Warren Jeffs didn't marry underaged girls, actually. "Because they hate weakness".
Jan-Michael Vincent, 'Airwolf' Star, Dies at 74
He appeared in TV and movies throughout the 60s, 70s, including roles in series like Lassie and Dragnet . Vincent's career waned after his Airwolf heyday and he retired from acting in 2009.

The Waugh Zone December 16, 2015
The five things you need to know on Wednesday December 16, 2015…
1) THE OTHER DEFICIT
It’s David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn’s last PMQs before Christmas and both will want to head to the break having given their troops something the cheer about. They each have a lot of material.
The PM may well dig up some choice quotes from Corbyn-sceptic Labour MPs. Corbyn could list U-turns on tax credits and now fracking, banker accountability (the Government’s watered down plans passed the Lords last night), dithering over Heathrow and cuts to FE colleges.
But the NHS could feature too. The NAO’s overnight report on the state of NHS finances makes grim reading for the Government, with trusts set to post deficits of £2.2bn by the end of the financial year next March. Shadow Health Secretary Heidi Alexander has a plum quote: “the financial crisis facing the NHS is so big astronaut Tim Peake can probably see it from space”.
The PM is bound to counter that he’s pumping in more cash than ever, thanks to the stable economy and the Spending Review. But yesterday HuffPostUK revealed that things are so bad in some hospitals they have had to take out multi-million pound loans simply to ensure doctors and nurses get paid at the end of every month. Almost unnoticed outside NHS finance circles, Jeremy Hunt has switched hospitals from getting ‘free cash’ to forcing them to take out interest-paying loans, as a deterrent to the building up deficits. It hasn’t quite worked.
I’ve talked to experts in the field and it’s stark just what a mess NHS finances are now in - partly due to enormous pressures to get safer staff levels, lower tariffs, and a lack of cash up-front. How long before Corbyn says that ‘the real deficit deniers’ are the Tories on the NHS?
2) CAM’S MAJOR PROBLEM
One issue where Corbyn could try to embarrass the PM is over Europe. Despite all the talk of doom and gloom ahead of the EU summit tomorrow, David Cameron is in chipper mood, telling colleagues privately how confident he is that other leaders will be constructive in response to his big demands on welfare and migration. He would have been cheered to by Donald Tusk’s letter yesterday warning there should be ‘no taboos’ during the working dinner to discuss the UK issue.
Corbyn may be tempted to read out letters like ‘Bill from Stone’ and ‘Bernard from Harwich’, given how unconvinced Eurosceptics are by the PM’s renegotiation so far. In the Standard yesterday, Joe Murphy revealed that senior ministers like Iain Duncan Smith are warning the PM against Brussels having control over any ‘emergency brake’ on migrants.
Today’s Sun reports that Theresa May, Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have all privately warned Cameron he must do more to insist on border control. As it happens, I note that leading ‘Outer’ Dan Hannan MEP was very openly chatting to a string of Eurosceptic ministers in Portcullis House yesterday, from IDS to Theresa Villiers.
Some MPs think Cameron has created his very own John Major problem by letting Europe dominate his tenure. Sir John was on the Today prog this morning, warning against the siren voices promoting ‘splendid isolation’ of the UK outside the EU. He said the ‘reality’ was ‘we are better off, safer..in rather than out’. He said Brexit would trigger a ‘high probability’ that Scotland would quit the UK. And Major signalled what sounds like No.10's new tactic, saying that while the PM's renegotiation was important its outcome "should not decide whether or not we remain inside the EU."
As for the Syrian refugee crisis that has caused so much upheaval across Europe, the Sun reveals that the PM will use PMQs today to announce that he's hit the 1,000 refugees-by-Xmas target. But maybe in the nick of time: the talk is that two jumbos jets containing refugees landed yesterday.
Jeremy Corbyn is going to address the party of European Socialists in Brussels tomorrow, with plans to set out alternative ideas for EU reform. Will those plans flesh out what John McDonnell told a meeting on Monday night, that ‘Left’ groups across Europe want to use our referendum to get a ‘restructured’ EU? And will Alan Johnson and Hilary Benn be happy?
3) CORBYN COORDINATING COMMITTEE
There is a growing realisation in the PLP that Jeremy Corbyn is here to stay, probably for the full five years to 2002. Some deep Corbyn sceptics still think their only chance of ousting him is between next May’s elections and the September conference. Others talk about waiting until 2017. Yet others are resigned to accepting his huge party membership mandate cannot be overturned or wished away.
And JC’s disciples are moving into more key positions. The Telegraph was first yesterday to report that the Shadow Cabinet was informed that Jon Trickett has been given the working title of ‘election coordinator’ for next May’s elections. The Times reports that ‘moderate’ MPs are worried that Corbyn will strengthen his grip on the NEC next year, with all six places from CLPs expected to go his way. Bex Bailey, a moderate who worked for Liz Kendall and represents Labour’s youth wing, is set to be replaced early next year by James Elliott, a prominent Corbyn supporter.
Siobhain McDonagh wrote in the Standard yesterday that abuse aimed at MPs who backed Syrian airstrikes had been targeted at women and was a “personalised violence” similar to domestic abuse. The Fabians has a new report out that just one in 10 of the party's most senior staff and one in six of its council leaders are female.
Meanwhile, Dan Hodges (whom the PM once called ‘my favourite columnist’) has quit the Labour Party. That met with some ridicule on social media. But another Corbyn critic, Hopi Sen, explained why he was staying.
BECAUSE YOU’VE READ THIS FAR…
Watch Donald Trump use last night’s GOP debate to answer whether he’ll run as an independent for President. Sounded like a non-denial denial, but he later told the Telegraph in the spin room there was ‘no chance’ he’d run against the Republican party.	
4) TIM PEAKES, DAVE TROUGHS
Tim Peake dominates the newspapers today, as he did every other bit of media yesterday. David Cameron was as much of a fan as everyone else, watching the lift-off on his telly. But unlike everyone else, the PM has a Twitter feed of more than a million people and unlike everyone else his office sometimes Tweets pics of him relaxing at home.
Twitter went mad yesterday as someone in No.10 failed to spot the clear Photoshop opportunities. The PM took in good humour his last ‘Meme moment’, when he was snapped on the phone to Obama, and has since joked to friends he will never be photographed making a call again.
I’m told the PM was completely oblivious yesterday to his new Meme, and was even unaware that the pic of him watching Tim Peake had gone online in the first place. He did laugh out loud when told that one mock-up featured him watching Jeremy Kyle. I understand he even asked ‘was there a hashtag?’ He was not told the full detail of just how many pics of him watching Percy Pig, Babe and other porcine and troughing images.
The only real disappointment today is that Parliamentary TV failed to capture Labour MPs singing Space Oddity as Anna Soubry quipped ‘ground control to Major Tim’ in the chamber yesterday.
Speaking of G-forces, the ground force numbers against ISIL in Syria are about to increase. The Telegraph splashes on military sources saying the UK is ready to provide intelligence and air support to the new coalition of 34 largely Sunni nations formed to fight the terrorists.
5) WELL HARD
MPs vote today on plans to allow fracking to go ahead under National Parks - as long as their well heads are located outside the beauty spots.
Campaigners have labelled the statutory instrument as a 'U-turn' as it goes back on Government promises to ensure that fracking doesn't take place in protected areas. It seems that there will be no debate on the change – only a vote on the SI.
Under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour have been attracting huge amounts of support from former Green party voters and now sees a real opportunity here. Blogging for HuffPostUK, John McDonnell today sets out how his ‘new economics’ will lead to a strategic approach to the renewables industry.

Digital Medicine/Remote Patient Monitoring is Expected to Save $305 Billion
By admin 13 Sep, 2016 Blog
Fort Lauderdale, FL, September 2, 2016 (Newswire.com) – Digital Healthcare/Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”) is making its revolutionary debut. Even in its early developmental stages, Digital Healthcare/RPM provides medical providers with the ability to monitor patients virtually (24/7), make diagnoses, offer treatment, and conduct follow-up monitoring at a fraction of the current cost of traditional healthcare practices and delivery methods.
Even better, the Federal Government is paying for this virtual, “non-face-to-face” monitoring for Medicare patients for 19 Chronic Conditions under CMS’ Chronic Care Management Code 99490 (1) and post hospital discharge under Transitional Care Management Codes 99495 and 99496.(2)
For Medicaid patients, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to approve experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that promote the objectives of the Medicaid and CHIP programs which allows hospitals to apply for waivers to implement these programs in some states. (3)
Preventative medicine has, therefore, never been more widely accessible as through these new connected digital health and Remote Patient Monitoring platforms. Expansion of Digital Medicine/RPM allows significantly more efficient access to more patient populations instantly.
Nearly half of all adults in the U.S. (117 million people) suffer from Chronic Conditions with nearly 58 million suffering from 2 or more. (4)
86% of the total cost of total U.S. healthcare goes to pay for these chronic diseases. (5)
With Digital Medicine and Remote Patient Monitoring, these patients can now be directly monitored in their homes to either prevent exacerbation of their chronic conditions or prevent medically unnecessary and costly 30–day readmissions.
Steven R. Gerst: Connecting through the EMR is critical to Real-Time, Actionable Data Transfer and Provider Reimbursement generating $305 Billion in Savings (est.)
Provider reimbursement for the new service can be billed directly through the EMR. Wirelessly connected blood pressure cuffs, EKG sensors, electronic weight scales, glucometers, spirometers and other devices are changing the dynamic of virtual care feeding real-time, actionable patient data directly to the providers with system alerts specific to each patient based on their condition and medications.
Hospitals are developing case management nursing teams to telephonically respond immediately to changes in patient vital signs and weight taken in the home or workplace, avoiding costly medically unnecessary 30 day readmissions and millions of dollars in penalties while improving patient care. One hospital system in Minnesota has demonstrated reductions in hospital readmissions for Congestive Heart Failure from the national average of 24.8%6 to less than 2% by simply connecting an electronic weight scale remotely into the hospital’s EMR system (7).
These advancements will dramatically impact the movement under the new MACRA, MIPS and APM legislation from “Volume Based” care reimbursement to “Value Based” and Outcomes Management reimbursement. (8)
According to a report by Goldman Sachs in its Internet of Things (IoT)9 series, joining the physical and digital worlds: changing physician and patient interaction through digital health “offers the most commercially viable potential to change the US healthcare economy.” Goldman Sachs estimates $305 billion in savings generated by 3 new innovations:
$200 Billion from Remote Patient Monitoring
$100 Billion from Telehealth, and
“An infinitely large savings” from Behavior Modification regarding obesity management, smoking cessation and overall lifestyle improvements.
The report estimates commercially available opportunities to provide these services and technologies at approximately $36 billion per year.
Dr. Steven Gerst: Efficacy Needed to Overcome Hurdles for Digital Medicine/RPM Adoption.
Chronic disease accounts for 1/3rd of total US healthcare expenditures – over $1 Trillion annually10. Heart conditions, COPD, asthma, and diabetes constitute the largest cost component. These conditions also have the greatest potential using Digital Medicine/RPM to improve patient outcomes, lower adverse events, and reduced costs when shifting to a Value Based- Outcomes driven approach to treatment and reimbursement.
Digital Medicine/RPM is a powerful enabler. These systems will serve as the information portal to data management, giving managed care the potential to lower its chronic care burden. Efficacy remains the standard by which to judge any digital health offering.
With respect to digital health, “efficacy” is further defined as a user-friendly platform that collects accurate and actionable data promotes behavioral change (by both the patient and the provider in his treatment), demonstrates results, and also protects sensitive information.
The Goldman Sachs’ IoT report charts the hurdles in which must be overcome and how far we have progressed in the adoption of digital health including:
FDA Regulation: With over 100 digital health applications approved to date, the FDA has laid out guidelines for regulation and approval for digital health.
Patient Adoption: Developers are creating seamless interfaces for users of all levels of tech competency.
Physician Acceptance: While most healthcare organizations have attempted to integrate mobile into
their healthcare offerings in some way, there are many who are still not recognizing its viability, and are waiting for better technologies.
Reimbursement: Securing reimbursement is essential to the viability of digital health business models; while some argue that it is counter to the objective of connected health.
Privacy: Making mobile therapies HIPAA compliant represents a tremendous challenge in wireless healthcare.
Technology is now available to provide the efficacy needed to enable digital medicine through Remote patient monitoring and reimburse providers for their services. To learn more news about connected and digital healthcare, visit: www.stevenrgerst.com.

The healthcare system is moving towards performance metrics where physicians are able to collaberate with each other and have the data in their hands immediately. Biometrics can also help save patients' lives.

About MAT Treatments
About Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid; It can generate the usual opioid agonist effects but, not as greatly as those produced by full agonists, such as heroin and methadone. Full agonist opioids have the risk of side effects, abuse, and addiction. Not only does Buprenorphine have fewer risks, but it can negate all the effects of opioid agonists, and even lessen withdrawal symptoms in an addict whose bloodstream is currently carrying a full agonist.
About Methadone
Methadone treatment programs have many benefits, including: the reduced or stopped use of injection drugs; lowered risk of overdose; lowered rates of disease transmission; increased life expectancy; reduction in risky sexual behaviors; reduced criminal activity; and improved family and social stability.
About Suboxone®
Suboxone is a drug that is used for rehab treatment for individuals that are addicted to pain medication or opiates. Those wishing to use the Suboxone medication rehab plan will first need to make an appointment to be seen by the physician in the rehab center that uses this method. The individual will be checked for physical ailments that may prohibit them from using Suboxone as a treatment. If cleared by the physician the Suboxone rehab treatment will be started.

Analysis: Robert Mueller just handed Donald Trump a huge gift
President Donald Trump spent the last 18-plus months attacking the investigation into Russian interference and the possibility of collusion between his campaign and the Russians. On Sunday, that same investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, gave Trump something he wanted -- and needed badly: A dismissal on the question of collusion and no charges of obstruction against either the President or his team.

Donald Trump’s troubled charity foundation to shut down
botchway December 18, 2018
US President Donald Trump’s troubled charity foundation has agreed to close down amid allegations that he and others illegally misused its funds.
The move was announced by the Attorney General of New York State, Barbara Underwood, who will supervise the distribution of its remaining monies.
She has accused Mr Trump and his three eldest children of using it for private and political gain.
The foundation has previously denied the charges.
This is just one of several legal cases currently swirling around Mr Trump and his family. Others include a wide-ranging special counsel investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia headed by former FBI chief Robert Mueller.
Ms Underwood said the case against Mr Trump and his children Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric would continue.
In a statement, she said there had been “a shocking pattern of illegality involving the Trump Foundation – including unlawful co-ordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and wilful self-dealing, and much more”.
She continued: “This amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a cheque book to serve Mr Trump’s business and political interests.”
Under the terms of the deal to shut down the foundation, Ms Underwood said, it could only be dissolved under judicial supervision and could only distribute its assets “to reputable organisations approved by my office”.
She added: “This is an important victory for the rule of law, making clear that there is one set of rules for everyone.
“We’ll continue to move our suit forward to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held to account for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law.”

Prince Harry reveals if he prefers a girl or boy
22/10/2018
"After a busy programme, The Duke and Duchess have chose to cut back The Duchess's schedule slightly for the next couple of days, ahead of the final week and a half of the tour", she tweeted.
The Sussexes are now part-way through a 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, with 76 events on their schedule.
The appearance comes after the couple chose to slightly cut back Meghan's schedule for the next couple of days, according to multiple reports.
A Palace source said: "She is not sick, just exhausted". The source explained that Meghan had a "very late night" and they're trying to encourage her to work at a more consistent and manageable pace, that way she doesn't get overworked.
The royal couple has not said whether she has taken one and, as evidenced by his brother Prince William and wife Kate Middleton, who have three kids, British royal couples traditionally do not reveal the sex of their children before they are born.
Although Meghan is feeling the effects of jet lag having made the journey from London to Australia, both she and Chantelle noted that pregnancy can make you feel so wrecked that you feel jet-lagged even if you haven't stepped foot outside the house. He will also visit the iconic Lake McKenzie, where he will learn about Fraser Island's environment.
Cleveland Browns vs Tampa Bay Bucs
Credit the Browns for the comeback in a game they had no business being in position to win, but they should've still won it. They still have the league's top-ranked passing offense and will face one of the league's most inconsistent offenses.
Outgoing UN Ambassador Nikki Haley jokes about Trump, Sen. Warren in speech
Despite the speculation, Haley said during an October 9 meeting with Trump, "No, I'm not running in 2020". Haley has often been an unpredictable and independent force in the Trump administration.
Earth's Biggest Living Organism Is Dying
But about 80 percent of it is in a perilous state, according to a new paper published today (Oct. 17) in the journal PLOS One. It was discovered years ago in the Malheur National Forest in OR , an Armillaria fungus, which covers about 900 hectares.
The trunks were presented to him when a disabled sports presenter and two members of the Australian Invictus Games team visited him at Admiralty House, the Governor-General's residence where the royal couple are staying in Sydney.
'If it has been a very late night due to unforeseen circumstances, we have to adjust for that'.
Following a non-stop itinerary of events since arriving in Sydney, Meghan Markle is taking a break.
The royals still have several more stops on the tour ahead, so the couple will need their energy.
The Duchess has so far insisted she will not cancel any planned engagements, with the protective Duke appearing to keep a close and concerned eye on her while they are out in public.
"You are the new generation of service and the role models to us all and you are going to put on one hell of a show over the next week". On Sunday, Prince Harry told audiences during the medal ceremony for his wife was resting as "being pregnant takes its toll", according to ABC News.

Hassan to address business leaders
N.H.’s newly elected governor will address business leaders at a luncheon event.
CONCORD, N.H. – Feb. 5, 2013 – The Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire is pleased to host newly elected Gov. Maggie Hassan on March 11 for a briefing with business leaders. The governor will speak at a luncheon event to be held at the Radisson Hotel in Manchester from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Hassan will discuss issues that impact the business community and New Hampshire’s business climate, such as the 2014/2015 state budget, Medicaid expansion, state R&D tax credit, expanded gambling and more. She will answer questions from participants as well.
The luncheon event is sponsored by Baker Newman Noyes, Bank of New Hampshire, Catholic Medical Center, Citizens Bank, Comcast, FairPoint Communications, Fidelity Investments, Lindt and Sprungli, New Hampshire Association of Insurance Agents, Normandeau Associates, Sig Sauer and Unitil.
The cost to attend the luncheon is $35 for BIA and Capitol Connect members and $49 for non-members. To register, visit BIAofNH.com and click on the events calendar. Call 603-224-5388 x116 for information.
Gov. Maggie Hassan was sworn in as the 81st governor of New Hampshire on Jan. 3, 2013. She began her career in public service in 1999 when she served on the Advisory Committee to the Adequacy in Education and Finance Commission under Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. In 2004, Hassan was elected to the New Hampshire State Senate where she served six years in office and was both president pro tempore and majority leader. In 2010, Business NH Magazine named her one of the state’s most powerful people.
While in the Senate, she worked with Gov. John Lynch to balance the budget and focus on the economy and New Hampshire families. In 2008, she helped pass universal kindergarten, worked to increase the legal dropout age to 18 and helped establish alternative education programs to lower the state’s dropout rate.
Hassan also supported legislation to allow children to remain on their parent’s health insurance until age 26 and helped pass Connor’s Law, which requires insurance companies to cover treatment for autism. She also worked to pass New Hampshire Working, sponsored the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and was instrumental in bringing marriage equality to New Hampshire.
Hassan earned her B.A. from Brown University and a J.D. from the Northeastern School of Law. In addition to serving on the Advisory Committee to the Adequacy in Education and Finance Commission, she also served on the board of Community Development Services and the Disabilities Rights Center.

The Red Fifth Column
posted Apr 28, 2015, 2:38 PM by John Schiess [ updated Apr 28, 2015, 3:11 PM ]
Our oath of allegiance refers to an enemy domestic. Such is the constant theme of this website. The enemy within is greater than without. A country has to be demoralized before first before it falls. Such was one of themes of the famous Chinese General Sun Tsu.
The fifth column has always existed in America. The more it succeeds, the more wars we get into that we shouldn't be in. A country must be successful at defeating that political force before it can defeat a foreign enemy. If the fifth column succeeds the focus becomes external as the Column consolidates power within, by sending the troops on "Palace Coup" Wars. Through wars and commie-fare, a country can be forced to spend itself in destruction.
Washington had his General Lee and Benedict Arnold and we have the likes of Obama, Kasich, Cuomo, and Boehner. As Cicero warned, the 'traitor who appears not a traitor" is more dangerous than the "barbarian who wears his banners openly".
Are you tired of the Col. Sanders, chicken wing of the GOP? Cluck, Cluck, Cluck! Please don't hurt us! Don't call us names....we'll give you all you want! How about responding with a few comments from famous US war generals?
At the Battle of the Bulge, outnumbered by the enemy, we heard the response of "Nuts". Another, when surrounded in Korea, responded,"We've got them right where we want them. Now we can shoot in any direction!"
After the revolution, the British did not all go home. Some went into banking and eventually forced the United States into a war with Britain again, when the US President would not continue the national bank idea.
If my memory serves me right, there was a man named Wilkerson, working with Aaron Burr, who tried to create a new nation out of the west, then called the Ohio valley. I believe Burr was executed after the failed coup. Risking my memory again, there was also a young officer involved who when given the chance to make amends, disowned our government and said he never wanted to hear the name of the United States again!
Many of us have seen the movie about the rest of his life aboard a US vessel, not allowed to hear the name of our great country again, or any news of her progress. Such should be the fate of President Obama and his wife after an impeachment by Congress.
A case might be made for that the fifth column, working with Britain, helped bring about the Civil War. "Yellow" journalism played a role in the Spanish-American War, and the Banksters definitely played a role in both World Wars.
Eisenhower warned us about a military-industrial complex, with a vested profit motive, for getting us into wars all around the world. Why should they worry if they didn't have to go!? Have you noticed? All wars are run by "draft-dodgers". As Kissinger has said, the military dog will do what it is told to do.
The communist fifth column cost us the Vietnam War, while they made great gains at home building the commie welfare state. Washington had his General Lee, and we had Kennedy, Johnson, and King. Now we have the Bush dyn asty, Obama, Jackson, and Sharpton.
You might as well throw in the whole Democrat Party. Gov. Cuomo has just said rights are determined by the government, not by God; a perfect statement of communism. Am I the only one who "sees the signs"?
The Soviet homosexual(LGBT) crowd rejoices over the change in the governorship of Oregon. How low can they go there? In "Orygone" they worship their or..gun! Rather than look up to God, they have a much lower view of life.
After running for Congress in 1988, I got out of that commie "hole in the wall" state. They've traded a governor's mistress for a lesbian. Why mess around with Hillary Clinton? The new Governor Kate Brown, and Tammy Baldwin would make a great presidential ticket for the Party. "What difference does it make!?" I'd better not give them any ideas!
Let us not forget Gov. Kasich. As things come down to the final battle for the liberty in America, more "Gen. Lee's" will come out of the woodwork. First of all, its not Obamacare! That term reduces principle to a personality issue. It should be called commie-care since the idea came straight out a book written by a Communist titled "Toward a Soviet America". One should not only read Alinsky's book, but this one too. Did you ever wonder where the idea for social security and the Dept. of Education came from?
And no, the Bible does not support
"obamacare". The Bible does not support stealing what another person has earned. Needs do not determine rights. Charity is not a government function; it is a function of individuals. Communism reverses the former statement. People that live the wrong way will always need the fruits of someone else's labor.
Communism turns needs into rights that don't exist. It cannot be done without the process of "legal plunder" by the government. When government transfers wealth from one who has earned it to one who hasn't, that's communism. If we do that, its normally called thievery. Kasich must be going to a Jeremiah Wright KGB run type church.
All free countries have do deal with both their enemy domestic...and foreign. When the former becomes too strong, and government too corrupt, we lose the foreign battle as we did in Vietnam. Ben Carson was asked why he didn't just stay retired? His answer applies to many of us. How can you enjoy retirement and watch your country fall from within? Are you ready for Freedom,Peace, and Prosperity...or tyranny, war, and poverty? The battle cry of the communist left is: worship us and government, sleep with us, and we'll steal someone else's money. Can you handle America's standard of God, Family, and Country!?
John Stossel had a special show about communism tonight. He interviewed a man who escaped Cuba after the Castro takeover, leaving his father behind because his father insisted the family leave and not wait for him. He said he would rather die than see his family live under communism. He was able to join them a short time later. Some say, if you can't beat them, join them. Or, better Red than dead. No, it is better to be dead than Red!
Winston Churchill said one should fight when the battle can be won. He also said it is better to fight when there is little chance of winning, than to have to fight when there is no chance at all. Boehner and the chicken GOP are leading us into the later statement. Are you FREEMAN(or woman) enough to deal with it? Are you ready to fight Communism...IN AMERICA!?

The Accusation
August 22, 2016
The Accusation
“Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?”
Job 1:9
God brought him up.
He asked the question.
In that question He reveals the confidence He has in one man: A man named Job.
Job was no ordinary man. Well, he was ordinary in many ways:
He had normal feelings.
He dealt with the same emotions as anyone else.
He experienced the same longings, felt the same joy, was familiar with pain.
Yet, Job was no ordinary man. You see, he had been extraordinarily blessed:
He was the father of seven sons and three daughters.
Seven thousand sheep pastured his fields while three thousand camels roamed his hillside.
He was the owner of five hundred yoke of oxen. . .
. . . five hundred female donkeys. . .
. . . had a very large household. . .
The list could go on and on.
Extraordinarily blessed.
Job was the Donald Trump or, perhaps, the Bill Gates of his time. He had wealth beyond measure. Certainly he was a man of means. So much so that Scripture says that Job was the greatest of all the people of the East. Pretty impressive. No ordinary man.
And, God brought him up.
He asked the question:
“Have you [Satan] considered my servant Job?”
Not only does He ask the question but in the asking He reveals the character of Job that results in the confidence He feels toward this man. Listen to the descriptors that He uses to describe Job:
Blameless and upright. . .
One who fears God. . .
[One who] shuns evil. . .
There’s none like him on earth.
Did you catch that? God said there’s none like Job. It’s an incredible statement about Job’s character.
It also makes a startling reality: Every other man, every other woman was not blameless or upright. That there were no others that truly feared or served God. In fact, the whole of humanity seems to be caught up in evil. The enemy was winning, he seemed to have their hearts. But, not Job.
So, God brought him up.
He asked the question:
“Have you [Satan] considered my servant Job?”
And, Satan had considered him.
He had been watching, waiting, wanting.
So, now he responds: “Doth Job fear God for nought?”
Did you catch it?
Could you hear the sarcasm in his voice?
Can’t you just feel the assertions of the accuser as he presents the charge?
Why wouldn’t he serve you?
Of course he fears you. . .
You’ve blessed him beyond measure.
You’ve placed a hedge of protection around him and all he has.
He’s the wealthiest man in all the East. . .
Why wouldn’t he serve you?!?
BUT:
IF You removed Your hand of mercy. . .
IF he were to lose all that he had. . .
IF Your hedge of protection would be removed from his house. . .
He’d curse You to Your face!
What an accusation!
Read it again, slowly, and think about what he is saying.
Listen closely to what he asserts.
With his crooked, bony finger pointing in the face of God he snarls his lip and speaks:
IF You removed Your hand of mercy. . .
IF he were to lose all that he had. . .
IF Your hedge of protection would be removed from his house. . .
He’d curse You to Your face!
You can almost smell the stench of sulphur as he shrieks: “You’re not worthy of Job’s love, devotion. He only loves You because of what You do for him!”
It’s a dramatic scene that should cause me to examine my life. Why do I serve Him? Because of what He does? Because of what I get? Or, because of who He is?
Just a thought.
Now, back to the story:
God’s on trial.
He’s been charged.
The trial begins. . .

Marotzke & Forster response
February 8, 2015 climate sensitivity, energy balance, GCMs, temperature, variabilityEd Hawkins	
In a recent post on Climate Audit, Nic Lewis criticised Marotzke & Forster (2015, Nature) for applying circular logic to their arguments about forcing, feedbacks & global temperature trends. This is a guest post by Jochem Marotzke & Piers Forster replying to those criticisms.
Editor’s note: this is a technical post and comments will be tightly moderated for tone and content.
No circularity
It has been alleged that in Marotzke & Forster (2015) we applied circular logic. This allegation is incorrect. The important point is to recognise that, physically, radiative forcing is the root cause of changes in the climate system, and our approach takes that into account. Because radiative forcing over the historical period cannot be directly diagnosed from the model simulations, it had to be reconstructed from the available top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance in Forster et al. (2013) by applying a correction term that involves the change in surface temperature. This correction removed, rather than introduced, from the top-of-atmosphere imbalance the very contribution that would cause circularity. We stand by the main conclusions of our paper: Differences between simulations and observations are dominated by internal variability for 15-year trends and by spread in radiative forcing for 62-year trends.
Specifics
Our paper relies on one piece of explicit (deterministic) physics, namely energy balance (conservation). We maintain that the best way to represent this deterministic physics during a period of warming caused by radiative forcing F is through the model properties α and κ (see final paragraph below), in addition to F. This well-established tenet leads us to formulate the Earth’s energy balance in the form:
ΔT = ΔF / (α + κ) (1)
where ΔT and ΔF are (linear) trends over a specified period of global-mean surface temperature and radiative forcing, respectively. We reason in our paper why equation (1) motivates the linear regression that quantifies the contributions of across-ensemble variations of ΔF, α, κ, and furthermore of internal variability, to ΔT in the CMIP5 ensemble. Internal variability is represented as an additional error term in (1). Our linear regression motivated by (1) and applied to all possible trends during the historical period is a major methodological innovation of our paper, irrespective of how the numbers on the right-hand side are obtained.
The issue that was brought up relates to how we obtained the time series of simulated radiative forcing F from which to calculate the trends ΔF. Unfortunately, radiative forcing for the historical period is not straightforward to diagnose from a model. However, the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance N (downward minus upward radiation) is available for many models. This radiative imbalance arises originally from the radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and other influences. But N and F are not equal, because the surface warms (say, by an amount T), and more radiation is emitted back to space. This amount of radiation is usually expressed as ΔT, such that we have:
N = F – αT (2)
Because N is readily available but F is not, Forster et al. (2013), from where the time series of F were taken, used the pre-determined model property α to obtain F by:
F = N + αT (3)
using the N and T that they diagnosed from simulations of the 20th century. This is a correction that needs to be applied to N so that one obtains the radiative forcing. On the right-hand side of (3), the two terms are of comparable magnitude over multi-decadal timescales, and the first term dominates over 15 years. Not correcting for the increased back radiation would, on physical grounds, imply using N, which contains the very contribution from the surface response T that we must eliminate in our estimate of F.
Of course one could legitimately ask how accurate this correction is, and we would hope that in future generations of coordinated model simulations a better direct diagnostic of F is possible. But for the CMIP5 models used in our study and in Forster et al. (2013), applying equation (3) has been the only approach possible. Forster et al. (2013) performed a number of tests of their procedure and found it to be adequate to produce time series of radiative forcing. However, it is possible that owing to an imperfect correction, our attribution of temperature trends to either forcing trend or feedback contains some ambiguity. This ambiguity is not new. In fact there is no unambiguous way of splitting forcing and feedback, and this remains a problem that the climate research community has grappled with for some time (e.g., Hansen et al. 2005, Myhre et al. 2013).
For understanding the results and limitations of our paper, it is crucial to appreciate that this ambiguity only refers to the contributions by the different elements of deterministic physics that we identify, and not to the total of deterministic (regression) contributions. In particular, our conclusion about the magnitude of internal variability in surface-temperature trends (dominant for 15-year trends, substantial for 62-year trends) is insensitive to the ambiguity.
As we have shown in our paper, our novel estimates of internal variability in the CMIP5 ensembles are consistent with completely different approaches, for both 15-year and 62-year trends.
We note that the order of magnitude of our diagnosed α contributions to spread in 62-year temperature trend are consistent with what is expected from equation (3) in Marotzke and Forster (2015). We notice further that from equation (1) here, it is obvious that ΔT varies proportionally with ΔF whereas ΔT varies less than proportionally with either α or κ (unless κ becomes very small, close to a new equilibrium, in which case ΔT varies inversely proportionally with α); this provides ready explanation for a lesser role of ensemble spread in α or κ over the historical period, compared to ensemble spread of radiative forcing. This counters the spurious argument outlined by Lewis for rejecting a small role for α on purely physical grounds.
Additionally, Lewis claims that the values for climate feedback parameter α and ocean heat uptake efficiency κ are so uncertain as to render them useless. But the α and κ values we use were diagnosed previously using established methods, relying on strongly forced, idealized model simulations (Andrews et al. 2012, Kuhlbrodt & Gregory 2012; Vial et al. 2013, Flato et al. 2013). These approaches and simulations are defined such that α and κ can be viewed as being model properties. By contrast, Lewis used historical simulations in trying to diagnose α and κ.
At the 2014 AGU Fall Meeting it was shown independently by Kyle Armour (MIT), Drew Shindell (Duke University), and Piers Forster that over the historical period these quantities change over time. Hence, their diagnosis from historical simulations is highly uncertain. This also supports the physical explanation as to why α and κ have a small role in determining model spread that Lewis did not understand. The small spread supports the reasoning that unique values of α and κ do not well characterise 20th century trends.

The bit I got stuck on reading your paper was this: why do you need to estimate the multiple regression coefficients? According to your linear expansion of equation (3), can’t you calculate the beta values directly from the ensemble means of delta F, alpha and kappa?
Reply

Dear Peter,
Good point. We used equation (3) for conceptual guidance, suggesting which predictor variables to use in the regression, rather than wanting to rely on its quantitative correctness. And given what we’ve since learned about alpha and kappa during the 20th century (cf., 2014 AGU meeting), this seems like a sensible choice. But there is certainly room for follow-on studies here.
Best wishes,
Jochem

Thanks for the reply.
I still don’t really understand what the linear expansion is doing. Wouldn’t the linear expansion of any function just give you the same multiple regression equation? I would think that the linear expansion you’ve used would at least suggest a restriction beta_2 = beta_3.

I thought Lewis was making two points:
– in the M&F earth energy balance equation dT = dF / (α + κ), dT is actually a hidden component of dF i.e it’s appearing on both sides of the equation (like saying 3 = 10-10+3). So the equation is flawed from the start and any regression using it will be equally flawed such that no substantive conclusions can be reached based on the regressions; and
– the values for a and k have been chosen by M&F arbitrarily and it’s possible to get wildly different values using historical simulations. So, again, no substantive conclusions can be reached based on the regressions.
On reading this response it seems to me:
– M&F have nothing to say about the both-sides-of-the-equation issue;
– they just prefer their arbitrary choice for a and k.
Not sure this is an effective rebuttal.

(2013) by applying a correction term that involves the change in surface temperature.

I’ll have a go at this one.
in the M&F earth energy balance equation dT = dF / (α + κ), dT is actually a hidden component of dF i.e it’s appearing on both sides of the equation (like saying 3 = 10-10+3). So the equation is flawed from the start and any regression using it will be equally flawed such that no substantive conclusions can be reached based on the regressions
It’s not correct that dT is a hidden component of dF. The external forcings are imposed on the climate models – they’re external, they don’t depend on T by definition. However, it’s quite tricky to work out what dF actually is because it’s both self-consistently determined in the models (i.e., the models calculate the radiative influence of the different external effects) and the model is also responding to these external forcings (i.e., the external forcing is essentially defined as being the radiative effect in the absence of a temperature response).
So, how to you work out what dF actually is in each model? You just use energy conservation. If there is a change in external forcing of dF in a model with a climate sensitivity of alpha, then if the temperature response is dT, the change in the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance well be dN where,
dN = dF – alpha dT.
So, if you know (from your model output) what dN and dT are, you can get dF from
dF = dN + alpha dT.
That may look as though dF depends on dT, but it doesn’t. If internal variability were to produce a small fluctuation if dT, then dN would also change in response to that and dF would remain fixed. So, just because dN and dT are being used to determine dF, does not mean that dF is somehow dependent on dT. So, the claim that the analysis is circular is – as far as I can tell – wrong.
Well, that’s my understanding. Those who know better than me are welcome to correct any of my misunderstandings.

Great responses by Mark and TTTP
If it helps:
Nic is right that ΔT does appear on both sides, we are not arguing about this we are arguing about the implications.
We see the method as a necessary correction to N, to estimate the forcing, F. This is what we are looking for in the model spread, not the role of N – it would be more circular to use N as this contains a large component of surface T response.
We know this method of diagnosing F works very well – e.g. see Fig 5 of Forster et al. 2013
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/jgrd.50174/asset/image_n/jgrd50174-fig-0005.png?v=1&t=i5xs0usz&s=4575b4038f30bacc5c54f4474456faf952af926d
We only see it as a problem as it affects the partitioning of the spread between α and F. We find that this creates some ambiguity over the 62 year trends but not the 15 year trends.
Uncertainty in the partitioning is different than creating a circular argument. We simply don’t do this.

As Piers and others have said – the crucial aspect is that N (as calculated in the models) contains a component related to T. So, the correction made to N to obtain F is trying to remove that T influence, rather than adding it.
Ideally F would be diagnosed separately from the models, but it isn’t (generally), so we have to use the correction to get a best estimate of F – which doesn’t depend on T, even though it looks like it from the way the equations are written. This correction will not be perfect but has been shown to work well in more idealised situations where we have better estimates of F, as in the link that Piers provides.

Ed.

I wrote the following short comment in another discussion (at and Then There’s Physics). Have I understood the issue correctly?
—
Basically we have first
F = N + α T
Then we do regression
T = a + b F + c α + d κ + e
Using the first in the second and moving one term to the left hand side
(1 – α b) T = a + b N + c α + d κ + e
That seems to lead problems, if the coefficient of T may be close to zero. Thus we should perhaps not trust the results, if the regression tells that b is close to 1/α even in part of the situations.

Piers and Jochem,
is it possible to illustrate the (lack of) circularity by showing the correlation between the estimated forcing, F, and the simulated temperature, T? If this correlation is small, then does that demonstrate the claim of circularity to be unimportant?
It might appear from
F = N + αT
that F and T will be correlated, but this isn’t necessarily the case if N and T are themselves (anti)correlated. Would the correlation between diagnosed F and simulated T help demonstrate this issue? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?

February 9, 2015 at 2:12 pm	
You’d think that if the climate models are conserving energy, that N and T would have to be (anti)correlated. Or, that for a fixed change in forcing F, N + αT is constant for all realistic values of T. However, it might be good to illustrate this.
Reply
Piers Forster says:	
February 9, 2015 at 3:35 pm	
Tim, through the energy budget all these terms are related, so you expect correlations. Therefore it is difficult to gauge the quality of our F estimate, although we did the best job we could in my earlier paper – and it seems robust.
On 15 year periods random fluctuations in N dominate and this is not an issue

Nic Lewis says:	
February 9, 2015 at 5:09 pm	
Model N and T trends are positively correlated across the models over most 62 year periods during which trends are significant: as to +0.62, +0.74, +0.56 and +0.42 starting in respectively 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951. It would be surprising if they weren’t, as the kappa model assumes that dN = kappa*dT

Ed,
Does the dependence of N on T enter the actual analysis done based on the CMIP5 archived simulation using the methods of Forster et al (2013) and this paper?
That’s not obvious to me.
If it does, that affects the regression coefficient that makes T poorly determined.
Reply
Ed Hawkins says:	
February 9, 2015 at 2:17 pm	
The CMIP5 models output N and T, so these two are used to estimate F (see Eqn. 3), which is (hopefully) independent of T.

Nic is right that ΔT does appear on both sides, we are not arguing about this we are arguing about the implications.
Whatever the physics rationale, this is a bad setup for a regression. If your results are stable, then you should be able to get similar results via Nic Lewis’ equation (6) of the CA article – an equation in which Nic attempted to cancel out factors occurring on both sides.
It seems to me that the usual (if not universal) statistical approach to this dataset (given its warts) would be to begin estimation via equation (6), cancelling what can be cancelled, rather than trying to rationalize estimations containing elements on both sides that jeopardize any meaning to the regression.
According to Nic’s calculations as presented, regressions using his equation (6) yield entirely different results – a result that seems to me to be fatal to the assertions of the article . Thus far, no one here has confronted this problem.

Nic’s equation (6) has some similarity with the formula I present in a comment higher up. The way I write the formula tells that the circularity does not make the regression unstable, All regression coefficients can be determined as well as in absence of the circularity.
What may remain is an greater uncertainty in the reconstruction of the temperature from the results of the regression, because the coefficient of the temperature may happen to be very small.

I think Nic’s equation 6 not only makes it worse because dN depends on dT while dF does not, but also misses the whole point of the Marotzke & Forster analysis. The goal is to determine the externally forced trend and a residual due to internal variability.
If I have this right then I also think Nic’s suggestion is actually wrong. If you use dN to give you dT in the way Nic suggests, then using dT = kappa dN is not the forced response, it’s the actual temperature change and includes the forced response and the variability. Hence adding epsilon to this makes it wrong. It also doesn’t allow you to distinguish between the forced response and the variability, which was the point of Marotzke & Forster. At least, I think this is right.

Even if one dismisses Nic’s Eq. (6) [wherein he attempted to simplify the calculation in order to remove the purported circularity] is it the case that his Eq. (5) [from which he actually derives his regression] is also an incorrect analysis?

There obviously seems to be a difference between how a physicist and a statistician approach statistical analysis. It seems to me that the physicists are to some extent hypothesizing a can-opener.
But watch what happens (as I understand it and I haven’t parsed it) if you start from the data: in this case, what you have are the series N and T. ATTPhysics says: dN depends on dT while dF does not. Well, if dN depends on dT, that’s precisely the sort of thing that you want in a statistical relationship. Rather than being ill-suited to regression, isn’t it ideally suited to regression? ATTP’s comment seems to misunderstand the entire purpose of statistics.
From a physics point of view, you may want to add alpha*T to N get F, but from a data/statistics point of view, the two series: T and N+alpha*T, are going to be related by construction. Even if there is a real relationship somewhere, you won’t be able to disentangle it from the tautological relationship created by construction.

Steve,
I’ve responded to this on your blog too, but it seems to me that you’ve suddenly turned this into a statistics problem. It isn’t. The goal was to determine the externally forced and internal variability contributions to the model trends for different time intervals. To do this you need to have estimates for the external forcings (which is done in Forster et al. 2013). You then take these forcings and use them to determine the forced trends and, by comparing with the actual trends, estimates for the contribution due to internal variability.
You appear to be suggesting that it would be better to use dN rather than dF because it suits the statistics better. Well, you can’t use dN to determine the forced trend so whether it suits the statistics better is really rather irrelevant.

HAS,
I wasn’t arguing against statistics. I was simply pointing out two things. The suggestion that dT appears on both sides because dF depends on dT is incorrect, because if climate models conserve energy, then the quantity
dN + adT
does not depend on dT. It depends only on the change in external forcing, dF, which is external and, hence, by definition does not depend on dT.
I was also pointing out above, that replacing
dT = dF/(alpha + kappa)
with
dT = dN/kappa
doesn’t work because the goal of Marotzke & Forster is to determine the range for the forced trend and the range for internal variability. Since dN/kappa is not the forced trend, you can’t use it in place of dF/(alpha + kappa). The forced trend depends on F, so if you want to determine the range for the forced trend, you need to use F.
Of course you need to use some form of statistical analysis to do this kind of work. However, statistics does not trump energy conservation.

Sorry, you miss the point, and it is a point I and others were raising at CA. You are confusing the real world with what is being shown in these models, models that have been estimated using statistics.
As I said whether these data sets exhibit the behavior you would like them to is an empirical issue – you can’t guarantee it a priori just because the physical world should perform that way.
The imperative to demonstrate this is doubly important because the way the model data was derived, on the face of it, violates the assumptions of the tools used.
Ross McK makes the same point to you at CA suggesting a Hausman endogeneity test to demonstrate your assertion to be true.

I saw Ross Mckitrick’s comment and I don’t think what he is saying or you’re saying is correct. You seem to be suggesting that quantities like dN and dT are statistical. Well they’re not. A climate model is a physically-based model that uses the laws of physics to determine how our climate will respond to changes in anthropogenic forcing (for example). Therefore at any instant in time (to within the accuracy of the method)
dN = dF – adT
Therefore
dF = dN + adT.
Since dF is an externally imposed quantity, it does not depend on dT and therefore neither does dN + adT. Just because someone is using a statistical technique to extract information from a climate model does not make the above untrue.
Now if you want to go ahead and show that climate models violate energy conservation to an extent that would make it problematic, go ahead. That, however, would not change the point I’m making: if a climate model conserves energy (to a suitable accuracy) the term dN + adT is independent of dT.
HAS says:	
February 10, 2015 at 8:27 pm	
You need to think about how dN and dT are derived. They are statistical entities derived from the models. There is no guarantee they will behave as you say – particularly when you try and go on to partial out the dF from it.

Whether that is historical with GHG or without the point remains, they come from model runs, not nature.
Ross McKitrick says:	
February 10, 2015 at 10:02 pm	
Sorry but dN and dT have to be statistical as they are estimated trend terms. In fact they are trends estimated over quantities that are averaged up over other quantities that are themselves empirical approximations to unobservable quantities that might, at a very fine level of resolution, be variables in an actual law of physics. But at the level of usage here, dN and dT are statistics, not physical variables.
Exogeneity of dF cannot simply be asserted, but it can be tested. There are lots of cases in econometrics where endogeneity bias is suspected but can’t be established a priori. But it’s a big issue: if it is present, the regression results are absolutely meaningless. The prima facie case for endogenity bias here is certainly strong enough that an econometrics reviewer and editor would have demanded it be tested.
HAS says:	
February 10, 2015 at 10:13 pm	
Just on the “too philosophical” issue, I think not.
It is a straight forward empirical question that needs to be answered. Are the estimates of the T and N time series used in the analysis and the F series derived from them sufficiently well behaved that the F can subsequently used as desired.
On one side there are theoretical statistical arguments that suggest not, on the other practical responses that say they absolutely are or that it is close enough.
Too start to resolve the issue protagonists need to understand what each other is saying.
I’m still not sure that ATTP quite agrees that the chain between nature and the actual estimates in use (and the techniques used along that chain) is weak enough to warrant systematic analysis.
Ed Hawkins says:	
February 10, 2015 at 10:59 pm	
All the data is downloadable for anyone to do a systematic analysis. Can go to Climate Explorer and calculate the global TOA variables (to get N) and global temperature (T) for all the historical simulations. No-one has yet demonstrated using the actual data that T and N are not well behaved enough as far as I’ve seen.

I have understood the logic of the paper as follows. For simplicity I consider one single period of 15 or 62 years. The same process is repeated for every period independently.
We observe that model runs in the ensemble have produced a wide spectrum of temperature trends for the period being studied. We present the question:
Is it possible to find simple characteristics of the model runs that can be used to predict the temperature trend ΔT that that model produces?
The hypothesis is that a suitable set of characteristics is α and κ as descriptors of the model and ΔF as descriptor of the external conditions, and that the model where these characteristics enter is a linear model.
ΔT = a + bΔF + c α + d κ
The coefficients of that linear model are to be determined by regression. One complication is that the CMIP5 database does not tell forcings, but it tells TOA imbalances N. Therefore the substitution
ΔF = ΔN + α ΔT
is used as operative definition for ΔF in the regression.
Regression can now be performed as minimization of the sum of squared residuals given by the formula
e = (1 – α b)ΔT – a – bΔN – c α – d κ
for each of the model run of the ensemble.
Determining the coefficients is clearly a stable task that gives unique answers. The fact that ΔT occurs on both sides in one version of the formula does not make this step any weaker in the determination of the regression parameters.
We have thus a formula that can be used to predict ΔT given ΔF, α and κ of the model run. It’s true that the operative definition of forcing is not optimal, but that does not prevent the use of the regression model, when the value of ΔF is assumed. This can be considered one additional assumption on top of the others, and this one is not the most problematic.
The Figures 2 and 3 of the M&F paper tell about the results from this regression for each of the period considered.
I do not believe that any one of the tests of exogeneity or endogeneity can be applied to this analysis. We lack the consistent alternative needed for such a test.
The approach is based on strong and crude approximations including the assumption that a model linear in the variables is good enough. Thus what’s really needed is an overall assessment of the validity of the model as presentation of the ensemble rather than formal tests of some part of the derivation. For the present purpose the most essential point is that the determination of the regression coefficients is well behaved, and I think that there are no problems in that.
One calculation that can be considered part of a test has been done, the calculation of residuals, but we do not know, how large the residuals would be, if the model were a good presentation of the ensemble. Other models could be developed for the same task and the residuals compared. That might tell something.

But don’t we have a problem using dF (as M&F do) rather than dN? We have lost an error term by assuming the relationship is certain haven’t we?
Your model now looks like Lewis’ equation 9.
Ed Hawkins says:	
February 11, 2015 at 12:03 am	
Yes, as M&F describe in the post, they make the assumption that their estimate of F is good enough. They also argue that this makes no difference on 15-year timescales as the other variability term dominates. For the 62-year timescales they acknowledge that this introduces some ambiguity, although the method to derive F has been tested in other situations in Forster et al. 2013.

No sorry you miss the point. Accepting the way F is estimated warts and all (as described by M&F) I’m asking if there is a problem using the calculated F time series rather than the original time series from which it was estimated.
Ed Hawkins says:	
February 11, 2015 at 12:29 am	
Yes, N does not provide the necessary information alone to do the analysis that M&F wanted to do – i.e. to test the relative roles of forcing and variability. N is useful for other purposes.

Yes. That is obvious. You need to partial out F.
What we are talking about is how to do this statistically and whether M&F could just pick up the F as reported, or whether they needed to include the precursor time series as part of their analysis to make sure the error terms propagate through correctly.

HAS,
Whether this approach leads to some problems in exceptional situations or to no problems at all depends on the use of the resulting regression formula.
(1) There are no extraordinary problems in the determination of the coefficients of the regression formula.
(2) The regression formula is well behaved everywhere, when it’s used with ΔF as the independent energy flux variable.
(3) If the formula is used to estimate the temperature with ΔN as the externally given energy flux variable, the coefficients of ΔT diverge, when the case happens to be that bα is very close to one. Thus estimating the contributions of ΔN, α and κ to ΔT may be highly suspect. There’s the possibility that some of the model runs happen to have such conditions for some of the intervals as α and κ are fixed for each model, and the regression coefficient b is different for each interval, but the same for every model.
(4) The paper of M&F does not use the suspect operation of (3), but the safe one (2) in dividing the temperature change to three causal components and the residual. That’s the physically meaningful way of dividing it.
(3) may lead to larger problems for the same reason that makes TOA imbalance more variable also in the real Earth system. Looking at TOA is not a particularly useful approach, when we wish to determine the surface temperature, but it’s more useful in the estimation of the forcings. The dependencies (values of partial derivatives) work that way also in the real world.
Pekka Pirilä says:	
February 11, 2015 at 11:17 am	
HAS,
There parameters all well estimated, there are no problems in that. A problem arises only, when we use the equation in the form
ΔT = (a + bΔN + c α + d κ)/(1 – α b)
to calculate an estimate of ΔT, because here we divide by a number that can be zero or very close to zero.
This is not a problem, because none of the questions asked requires this step or something that involves it implicitly.
Somebody might ask such a question, but the paper of M&F does not require that.
HAS says:

I can understand your comments (1) & (3) if applied to your equation
e = (1 – α b)ΔT – a – bΔN – c α – d κ
But I am at loss to understand comment (1) or (2) if applied to
ΔT = a + bΔF + c α + d κ
unless you are saying this is relates to the particular data set as it came out in the wash, and in particular in the case of (2) that having done (1) the thing doesn’t explode.
While (1) may be true wrt ΔT = a + bΔF + c α + d κ (namely you can determine the coefficients) the question is in doing that have you violated the assumption required to draw useful conclusions in terms of the estimated parameters?

On a re-read I think I understand more clearly.
e = (1 – α b)ΔT – a – bΔN – c α – d κ
is the equation you refer to in comment (1) although I note that α ΔT+ ΔN doesn’t exactly equal ΔF. The error terms from Forster’s earlier fitting will intrude.
You are then saying in (2) that if you use the parameters estimated by that equation with ΔF constrained to the range it varies over it doesn’t blow up.
But in (3) you are saying it can do over the practical range of ΔN.
Correct?

This is again a repost of a comment at aTTP. I would like to hear, what the authors (or somebody else) think about this. It would be nice to learn also, whether it’s possible to check the analysis to see, whether the conditions occur that might be problematic.
—-
As far as understand correctly the paper, the idea is based on the assumption that the temperature variations (or trends over 15 years and 62 years) that the CMIP5 models produce can be summarized by the formula
ΔT = a + b ΔF + c α + d κ + e
where
– ΔT is the temperature change or trend of the model (or CMIP5 run) considered
– ΔF is the change or trend in ERF (effective radiative forcing) over the same period as deduced from CMIP5 database in Forster et al (2013)
– α is the (constant) feedback parameter of that model as deduced from CMIP5 database and reported in Forster et al (2013)
– κ is the (constant) ocean heat uptake parameter of that model as deduced from CMIP5 database and reported in Forster et al (2013)
a, b, c, and d are regression coefficients that are determined by fitting the above formula to the CMIP5 based data of all model runs included in the study ensemble. e is the unexplained residual that’s minimized in the determination of the regression coefficients.
The same procedure is repeated independently for every 15 year and 62 year period that the overall period includes.
The next observation is that F was determined in Forster (2013) as
F = N + α T
where N is the TOA imbalance included in the variables of CMIP5 data base, while F itself is not included. F is not directly an externally defined forcing used in model calculations but a model result defined by the above formula (lacking better ways of determining the forcing from CMIP5).
Thus the formula used in regression can be rewritten (as I did before)
(1 – b α) ΔT = a + b ΔN + c α + d κ + e
This formula is effectively used by M&F to determine the coefficients a, b, c, and d for each period. The resulting coefficients are supposed to tell, how strongly the temperature variations depend on ΔF, α, and κ according to the first formula of this comment.
The problem of circularity arises from the fact that N is actually used rather than an independent F, because the value of F is not determined directly, but by the approximate formula given above. It’s expected that temperature variations grow with increasing ΔF and decrease with increasing α and κ, i.e. it’s expected that b > 0, c < 0, and d < 0. If b α > 1 the coefficient of ΔT is negative in the regression formula. Such cases might affect in a strange way all coefficients obtained as some of the models (those that have highest α) work against the others. This problem does not arise, if the resulting b is always so low that b α < 1 for all models. (If many of the values are close to 1 some lesser problems may arise).
Intuitively I would expect that something more dramatic would come out than seen in the results of M&F, if the problem is serious in this particular analysis, but that’s only the first intuitive guess. It’s also possible that this issue leads to cancelling effects that force the coefficients c and d to be always small (a surprising result of the M&F paper), but that’s not my first intuitive guess.
As you can see, the above is totally based on the formulas chosen by Forster (2013) and M&F. It’s not necessary – or appropriate – to confuse this logic by physical arguments, which are not part of the actual calculation. I used earlier the expression pure mathematics, perhaps I should have used the more accurate expression pure computation. Starting values are from a database, formulas are given. Results follow from that. Variable F is not a real forcing, it’s a derived construct (ERF) defined in Forster (2013), motivated by physics, but not an externally given forcing.

I think that I have found the resolution for the apparent problems myself. If I’m correct the whole issue is inconsequential.
Marotzke and Forster define a regression model to describe the behavior of the CMIP5 models for the set of variables ΔT, ΔF, α, and κ. The determination of the coefficients of the regression model brings in also the variable ΔN, and it’s connection to the other variables. This extended set of variables introduces the possibility of writing the regression model in various different ways. It makes it also possible to calculate, what happens when ΔT is changed without a change in ΔN in a model described by the regression. If we do that in the cases that I have described as problematic that leads to temperature feedback that’s larger than the original change. The model taken in that way is not well behaved.
The above is not, however, a real problem, as we can restrict the application of the model to the four variables used by M&F allowing ΔN to vary freely as required by the given relationship. Under these conditions the regression models do not have singular behavior at all. That’s the way M&F thought about the models throughout.
The next question is, whether the potentially problematic behavior of the model does enter the determination of the regression coefficients, when the goal of the analysis is to use the resulting model in the way M&F have used it. The answer seems to be that it does not enter.. When the relationships are used in this direction, there are no singularities, there are only situations. where the coefficient of ΔT is zero, and that’s not a problem for the regression.
Thus it seems that the issue Nic presented is not really a problem. There’s a circularity, but that enters in the direction, where it is not a problem at all.
(It took me too long to understand the situation. Obviously I have worked with mathematics too little for years and even for decades.)

The interesting issue remains that it’s difficult to understand, why α and κ have very little influence on the 62 year temperature trends. TCR should affect strongly the latest decades, and TCR = F/(α + κ). The authors give some arguments, but to me they are not sufficient to explain the observed behavior.
Either the result is caused by a property of the CMIP5 ensemble, which might mean that the ensemble is not representative of wider sets of models (perhaps due to a selective process), or the analysis of M&F does not for some other reason have power to extract the influence of model sensitivity on the trends over the period of strongest warming from added CO2.
I think this is an issue that should be studied further.

I remain convinced that the analysis carried out in the paper is flawed and does not justify the conclusions drawn, at least in respect of 62 year periods. As I wrote originally, it seems reasonable that internal variability dominates over most if not all 15 year periods.
I will be following this up with more specifics, but I have to spend time on other matters for a while.

Hopefully, he will see the benefit of disseminating this information. I don’t propose to comment further without such data.

And therein lies the ongoing problem. The attitude that seeking to understand, review, and replicate the specific results of the M & F work is somehow wrong.
It may well be easy to re-create the M&F work, but a re-creation, while similar, is not a replication – a verification/validation of the M&F work – which is at the core of the scientific method.
Presumably Steve McIntyre has access to Nic Lewis direct work product – even a layman like myself can understand that to judge Nic’s work, requires a clear understanding of the underlying M&F work.
[snip]
If M&F, or any scientist’s, work is robust they should welcome independent replication, review and verification.
Using the exact same data and methods as a starting point seems to me a “no-brainer” … why it is increasingly fought, often vociferously, by authors, seems to make little sense.

Hi AScott,
I agree that reproducing results is a core aspect of the scientific method. No-one is arguing otherwise. The question is what is the best way to test a result or conclusion.
If I see a result that surprises me I will first try and reproduce the result myself starting from scratch – this is a far more powerful test of a conclusion than taking the same code and rerunning or examining the scripts. There are numerous choices when writing an algorithm to process several GB of data and only by writing your own will you better understand those choices.
For example, Nic chose to use the ensemble mean in his calculations, whereas M&F used individual ensemble members – this will make a difference, especially as different models have different numbers of ensemble members. There may be justifiable reasons for making either decision.
My personal view is that if someone wants to test results, then they should take the same data and implement their own version of the algorithm based on the described methods, asking for clarifications where necessary. They can then test the sensitivities to whatever seems important. Even better would be to reprocess the data from scratch, but that is often a serious amount of effort!
Cheers,
Ed.

You can argue that your recommended way is the best way to test a result or conclusion, and you may or may not be correct. But why should one scientist demand that another use or not use a certain method? If M&F refuse to share their exact methods, that is what they would be doing.
If everyone believes AGW is potentially a very serious problem, should they not cooperate fully to quickly achieve the best possible understanding?

Hi Steve,
I have demanded nothing and I also said that methods should be clarified if there is any confusion. That is very clear.
But, I happen to think that to get the best possible understanding – which is what we all want – it is far better to spend the time and effort on trying different approaches to answer the same question, rather than trying to replicate exactly someone else’s approach.

Re-creation as you advocate is fine and well, but clearly serves a far different purpose than replication and validation of specific methods and results.
In my limited layman experience re-creation is highly dependent on understanding the specific data, methods and process.
Providing the data, methods and process in order that others can reicate and validate – or not – the claimed results is the scientific method.
Re-creation serves a different purpose altogether.
In my opinion every scientist should be required to provide their methods and data for replication as an explicit condition of funding and publication.

Because, as people other than me have also pointed out, it’s the answer to the question that is interesting, not necessarily the method itself. What we’d like to know is whether or not the result in M&F is a reasonable result or not; not whether or not they really have made some kind of mistake.
If people have the expertise to actually address this question, then why would they waste their time trawling through M&F’s data and code, why not simply address the problem again and see what you get? If people don’t have the expertise to address this question, then they’re unlikely to understand the significance of an error in M&F if they were to find one?
Think of this more broadly. Most research is taxpayer funded to a certain extent. Do you really think the taxpayer would be better served if half the experts spent their time checking the other half’s work, or would it be better if they all just did their research semi-independently, but all aiming to improve our understanding of whatever is being studied?
We develop understanding through different people/groups in different universities/countries trying to answer the same questions and – over time – converging on a similar answer, not through checking whether or not you can find a mistake in someone else’s analysis.
To be clear, I’m not arguing that one should ignore mistakes if they become obvious, I’m suggesting that spending your time looking for them is not going to be time well spent.

I have indeed been trying to scour the public domain in order to recreate the data so that I can understand fully what has been done in the paper. Perhaps you can help me. The paper states that the regression uses 75 models for which the forcing estimates are available. The supplementary table lists a total of 72. I found 77 on Climate Explorer that might qualify. Which figure is correct?
There are other inconsistencies and procedures described which may have several reasonable interpretations as well. Have you ever tried to do what you suggest?

Hi RomanM,
Yes, I have tried to do this type of reproducing on another paper. The lead author wanted an independent check of his results, so I took his described methods and implemented them in a different programming language. On another occasion a co-author checked my results separately. Both times it provided confidence in the results and improved our description of the methods!
You would have to ask M&F about which simulations and models were used. Data gets added to the CMIP5 database regularly and it will often depend on when the analysis was started as to which simulations have all the required data available at the time.

The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.
What if all the models have similar values of α and κ and that those values all correspond to greater climate sensitivities than in the real climate system? How would this influence the regression results with the linear regression model used:
ΔT = a + b ΔF + c α + d κ + ε

There is a significant difference – if you do individual, sequential regressions, you will invariably overfit your regression to the initial parameters (attempting to match all variations of the data) and underfit later parameters, in an order-dependent fashion. This can be seen in any regression with missing parameters, described as omitted variable bias.
That’s why you perform multiple regression – as the data you are trying to regress upon is (presumably, if you’ve correctly included the major physical inputs) the summed response of _all_ the parameters.

I’ve collated CMIP5 data from KNMI and have some useful scripts in R for doing so efficiently. I’ve written some posts on such results.
I suspect that I could carry out my own collation quite quickly and, if I pursue the matter, might well do so at some point.
However, in statistics, specialists like to use exactly the same data for testing statistical methods, so that differences in results arise from how one handles the data rather than differences in collation or in the larger data set. Since the dispute is about the validity of the statistical methods, this is by far the most efficient method.
It baffles me that this should be an issue for the climate science community, particularly in light of the experience over the past few years. Let’s hope that it isn’t in the present case.

Steve,
The point is that the goal of Marotzke & Forster was to try to answer a question. The question was essentially “how much of the spread in climate model trends can be explained by forcing variability and how much by internal variability?” So, if someone wants to check this (and it would clearly be good if others did) the ideal thing would be for them to simply do their own analysis. It doesn’t even have to be using exactly the same input data, because this result should not be sensitive to, for example, the number of models considered.
Let’s say you do this and get a very different answer. That would be interesting and we could all then try and work out why. Let’s say you do this and get about the same result. Does it mean that it’s now right. Well, no, but it adds some more confidence. Let’s say, at the same time, someone points out an actual error in Marotzke a& Forster, does this now matter? Sort of, but you’ve just got the same result, so maybe it wasn’t an important error. More people should check, but it might not matter.
Essentially we benefit more by other people doing their own analysis to answer the same question, than we do by people simply trawling through the code used by another group checking for errors and mistakes. An argument between you and Marotzke & Forster over a potentially silly mistake would be much less interesting than a discussion about why your independent analysis produces a different result to theirs (assuming that it does),

It would indeed be good to try a different method and check the results. But the first step should be to duplicate the previous result. That is standard practice in any science: first duplicate the previous result, making everything exactly the same as much as possible. Then try varying something.
If you don’t do that, you can’t tell what caused a different result, because you don’t know what’s different. You can’t tell if your same result is really the same, because you don’t know if two things are different and cancelled out.
http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html
Statistics isn’t the same thing as scientific experiments. But the nice thing about statistics is that you can repeat the calculation exactly, unlike regular science where you do the best you can. Skipping this step is a personal choice. Insisting that this step must be skipped makes no sense.
Anyhow, different people have different ways of studying things. If the easiest way for Steve McIntyre to understand exactly what someone did is to track the work in the code, I don’t see why others should be saying, Well, I find it more effective to do ___.

That way, we get to see if M&F’s methodology was flawed or robust (a useful learning exercise in itself) and we get to see if their results can be reproduced independently, which might inform us that, even though their method was suspect (or not), the results they got were reasonable (or not). Why exclude one or the other?

Thank you, Ed!
It seems that my former proposal may not be an explanation of the linear regression results discussed. But it is still puzzling that ΔT = a + b ΔF + c α + d κ + ε is not substantially varying with varying values of especially the climate feedback parameter α between different climate models. With an increasing positive feedback, corresponding to an increasing positive value of this parameter, the effect of a given amount of forcing should be deactivated by a decreasing temperature rise. Why is this not seen as a significant effect in the linear regression results?
I have another question about an effect that I wonder how it could influence the regression results. The climate models are tuned to describe the historical temperature curve. Shouldn’t this mean that a climate model with a higher α should use a higher ΔF in order to give the same ΔT for a given historical period than a model with a lower α.
As a consequence of this tuning there should be a dependence between α and ΔF. After linearization α would be approximated as a linear function of ΔF. How would such a linear dependence influence the linear regression results? Could this result in the observed absence of an effect from variations in the values of α?
Best regards,
Pehr

I don’t know if this resolves your first issue, but the regression model actually only involves the variation in each quantity (F, a, k) from the multi-model average for that quantity. i.e., it’s
Delta T’ = bo +b1 DeltaF’ + b2 a’ + b3 k’ + epsilon.
So, in a sense, they’re assuming that there is an already known multi-model mean trend, and they’re then using the regression to try and determine how much of the variation in the model trends can be explained by variability in the forcings (and in a and k) and how much is explained by internal variability (epsilon).

Hi ATTP,
I don’t think that your suggestion is an answer to my question. The linearization doesn’t change how the variables depend on each other.
Let us compare two models over the same historical period. Assume for simplicity that they have the same values for κ but different values for α and ΔF. If both models are tuned to show the same temperature change we have that ΔT’ = 0.
Thus ΔT’=0=a + b ΔF’ + c α’ + d*0 + ε => ΔF’ = -c/b α’-a/b
Thus ΔF’ is a linear function of α’ considering that the same equation is valid for all pair of models with the same κ. Substituting the definitions of ΔF’ and α’ shows that also ΔF is a linear function of α. I think that this reasoning may be generalized for the case with varying κ.

This may be getting too philosophical again, but F is imposed on the models; it’s external. The climate sensitive is a model metric and indicates how much the climate would warm under a doubling of CO2 and includes both the Planck response and the feedbacks. From a physical perspective (yes, I know, physics again) there shouldn’t be a direct relationship between F and a.
There seem to be three possibilities. Climate models do a reasonable job of representing the physical climate and hence they tend to behave similarly with some amount of variability. Or, they’re explicitly tuned, as you seem to be suggesting. Or, a combination of the two in the sense that some models may be rejected for just matching observations poorly without necessarily a good reason for doing so.
I don’t know enough to know which it is or even if it could be something else. What I will say is that I don’t think it’s correct to say that F depends on a, since F is external. Could a depend somehow on F. Maybe I guess, but I’m not quite sure how.

Sorry, I made a mistake with the sign of feedback and a correction of my former comment is needed! The following sentence should be:
With an increasing negative feedback, corresponding to an increasing positive value of this parameter ….
To see this note for example that the water vapor feedback is positive but is decreasing the value of the climate feedback parameter.

In connection with the dependence between ΔF and α and climate models Figure 1 in Schwartz et al. (2014) may be of interest. This shows that for the whole preindustrial period, with a fixed observed value of ΔT, the CMIP5 climate model results gather around at straight line in a log-log-diagram for ECS vs. ΔF-ΔN. This straight line in the log-log-diagram has the equation
ECS=3.7/α=3.7 ΔT/(ΔF-ΔN)
where ECS and ΔF are variables but ΔN and ΔT are constant.
The following derivations shows how this equations follows from Equation (1) ΔT= ΔF/(α+κ) in the paper by M&F:
α= ΔF/ΔT-κ=ΔF/ΔT-ΔN/ΔT=(ΔF-ΔN)/ΔT; 1/α= ΔT/(ΔF-ΔN); ECS=3.7/α=3.7 ΔT/(ΔF-ΔN)
I think that this supports my argument about a dependence of ΔF and α between different climate models.

Pekka has proposed that the regression can be done in a restated form of the original equation. This is incorrect. The problems with the regression model adopted in M and F are due to the endogeneity of the situation and in no way do they depend on (nor does this comment address) the correctness of the specification of the model.
In order to understand the arguments on the effects of circularity on the regression used in M&F, it is necessary to look at the Least Squares methodology in a bit more detail.
The authors start with a mathematically based statistical model:
ΔT = a + b ΔF + c α + d κ + ε
In the model, the variables ΔF, α and κ are assumed to be independent of ε which accounts for the random variation of ΔT in the statistical model. The ε’s are assumed to be independent of each other and to have means equal to 0. In this case, the authors have implicitly assumed that the ε’s are also homoscedastic, i.e. each having the same variance. There is a further very important assumption that the ε’s also be independent from all of the predictors.
In LS, estimates of the coefficients and the variance of the ε’s are obtained by first forming a sum of squares of the residuals:
SSE = ∑ε2 = ∑[ΔT –(a + b ΔF + c α + d κ)] 2
and then minimizing SSE with respect to the parameters a, b, c and d. It should be noted that the parameter estimates are functions not only of the non-random variables, but of the ε’s as well so they are random variables within this structure. In this case, the minimization procedure is simple to carry out using easily calculated matrix algebra.
Now what happens if ΔF is calculated from a previous relationship with two variables: ΔF = α ΔT’ + ΔN?
We substitute this relationship into the original equation to get:
ΔT = a + b(α ΔT’ + ΔN) + c α + d κ + ε
If ΔT’ is not the same as ΔT, then nothing is changed. The variables on the right hand side are still unrelated to ε and the entire procedure gives identical results to the previous case. However, if ΔT’ and ΔT are identical, the situation becomes radically different.
Now, ΔT has become a predictor of itself and the ε’s are present not only at the end of the regression equation, but also (invisibly) through the ΔT which is also on the right hand side. The predictors have violated a very important assumption that they must be independent of the ε’s. Hence, the usual simple regression procedure fails and all results from it are spurious. Estimates of the parameters, confidence interval and p-values will be biased and therefore neither reliable nor scientifically meaningful. This violation occurs even if one uses ΔF in the regression procedure. Despite the fact that you can’t “see” ΔT in the equation, its effect is still present mathematically because it has been used in the calculation of ΔF.
To produce a solution for this situation, the regression equation can be rewritten as Pekka suggests:
(1 – b α) ΔT = a + b ΔN + c α + d κ + ε
and the sum of squares becomes:
∑ε2 = ∑[(1 – b α) ΔT – (a + b ΔN + c α + d κ)] 2
Minimizing this with respect to the coefficients in the equation is not as simple as in the above cases, but can be done with a little bit of programming or by using available optimization techniques. But the story does not end here. From the regression, we need to form the decomposition:
ΔT = Predicted(ΔT) + Residuals(ΔT)
In the ordinary regression case, the predicted value is calculated by replacing the corresponding values of the predictor variables into the equation for each model. The residuals are then calculated by simple subtraction or taken directly from the minimizing process for SSE. For the circular case, the entire equation must be divided by (1 – b α). Note that α (and therefore 1 – b α ) are in fact vectors whose elements have different values depending on which climate model the particular observation is from. This has some important consequences, not the least of which is the introduction of bias into the entire estimation process.
First, b (and therefore 1 – b α) is itself a function of the ε’s in the model. The distribution of the ratio of two random quantities is very complicated and can be unstable, particularly if the divisor is close to zero.
A second consequence is that the effective coefficients for the predictor variables will be different for each climate model in the regression. As noted above the divisor is a vector so the actual value will be different for every observation.
Finally, the residuals are no longer the ε’s themselves. Due to the division process, they have become ε/(1 – b α). Their independence has been destroyed due to the common presence of the estimate of b and they are now heteroscedastic with a variability depending on the sign of b as well as the magnitude of α.
The bottom line is that the regression done in the M and F publication is inappropriate and their subsequent results are scientifically unreliable and difficult if at all possible to correct.

Roman,
You’re ignoring a couple of things. One is that Delta N also depends on Delta T through the equation
Delta N = Delta F – a Delta T
Therefore it seems to me that if you want to put all Delta T terms on the LHS, you also need to move Delta N.
You also seem to be ignoring that the regression in Forster et al. (2013) was done using the full Delta T and Delta N values for each model, while the regression in M&F was done using Delta T’, Delta F’, alpha’ and kappa’, which are the variations from the ensemble model averages.

It is my understanding that ΔT and ΔN are the model-simulated GMST and TOA radiative imbalance variables. These are separate measures taken from the climate model. On the other hand, ΔF is calculated from ΔT and ΔN. It does matter what is calculated from what.
I am not ignoring what form of the variables was used in what paper because it does not matter. Both forms produce ***exactly*** the same estimates for b, c and d. Only the a’s will be different.
The predicted values and the and the residuals are also identical. This is what we teach in an elementary course on regression.

Roman,
[snip]
In a climate model, Delta F is an externally imposed quantity. By definition it does not depend on any internal quantity. It is what is driving the changes in the model. However, it is a quantity that is not easy to extract from the models because it is calculated self-consistently.
However, it is possible to extract the Delta Fs because (and I hate to say it again) if the models are conserving energy, then
Delta F = Delta N + a Delta T
So, yes, Forster et al. used Delta T and Delta N from the models to determine Delta F. This doesn’t mean though that Delta F somehow depends on Delta T because it is the external imposed forcing that is driving the changes in Delta T and Delta N
So, if you were to take you substition to its logical conclusion you would now recognise that Delta N also depends on Delta T through
Delta N = Delta F – a Delta T
and we’re back where we started.

You make the thing too complicated by not following, how the computation actually takes place. When you follow that, you see that the regression coefficients are determined in a straightforward way that’s not disturbed at all by the fact that the same ΔT occurs on both sides of the equation or multiplied by the sum of two terms that may be close to zero.
Potential complications appear only, if the resulting regression model is used to calculate ΔT from ΔN, α, and κ, but I agree with the authors that such calculations are not deeded in the analysis reported in the paper.

The first one may very well be an external existing (but unknown) quantity. The second one is an ***estimate*** of that quantity. The two would not typically be the same unless the system was completely deterministic.
If you knew the first one, then the second would not be necessary. But you don’t so you calculate the estimate from the variables you have available using the relationship between them. Yes, the estimated ΔF is strongly related to ΔT.

Then it would seem that you need to show that estimated Delta F is not a good representation of the actual Delta F.
However, you state that the estimated Delta F is strongly related to Delta T. How do you know this? If the model is conserving energy, then this is not true. Just because Delta T appears on the RHS of the equation in which Delta F is determined, does not make it so. As Ed, and others, have pointed out, using that form of the equation is done to remove (as well as possible) any dependence of Delta F on Delta T. Given your claim that this is not the case, I assume that you can actually show this.

I’m suggesting that if the models conserve energy, then that has to be true. Okay, we’re talking about globally averaged quantites and it’s possible that there could be regional variations that mean that alpha doesn’t always represent the actual feedback response at all time instants. But averaged over a suitable time interval, if models conserve energy then, by definition,
dF = dN + a dT
and since dF is externally imposed and does not depend on dT – by definition – dN + adT should not depend on dT.

ΔF used in the M&F paper is strongly affected by external input, but it depends also on the model and contains unknown contributions from internal variability.
The determination of the regression model from the CMIP5 data is a well behaved process, or more precisely all its steps have of a well behaved nature.
The regression model is, however, a model for the variables defined implicitly by the way the variables are handled in the models and further processing. The relationship of these implicitly defined variables and the real physical variables of the same name cannot be fully understood. Therefore it’s also uncertain, how well the model variables satisfy the laws of real physics.

From reading the discussion here I get the following picture of the alleged circular reasoning:
The forcing F appears in the form of input variables to the climate models that are independent of the calculated temperature change ΔT. (But the calculated temperature change is of course dependent on the change in the forcing ΔF).
However, in the paper by M&F the real input forcing has not been used but instead the changes of the forcing have been estimated according to the equation:
ΔFi*= ΔNi- αi ΔTi
Here * denotes that this is an estimated value and index i refers to the climate model simulation number. In this equation the values of ΔNi, αi and ΔTi are calculated by the climate model.
After that the values of ΔTi are assumed to be possible to be calculated by the equation:
ΔT= ΔF/(α+κ)
Using this equation a linear regression model is derived where index e refers to the ensemble mean:
ΔTi-ΔTe=ΔFi*/(αi+κi)-ΔFe*/(αe+κe)=a+b (ΔF*i-ΔF*e)+c (αi-αe)+d (κi-κe)
The regression model may also be represented in the following way:
ΔTi=a1+b ΔF*i+c αi+d κi
where
a1= ΔTe-(b ΔF*e+c αe+d κe)
Although the really input ΔF values may not have been dependent on ΔT the estimated ΔF* values are, because this follows from the equation used for estimating them.
Is this a correct account of the alleged circular logic?

Note that
ΔT= ΔF/(α+κ)=ΔF/(α+ΔN/ΔT) => ΔF= ΔN+ α ΔF (+ is the correct sign here, sorry for erring above).
Thus ΔFi is estimated with the same equation from ΔTi as used in the derivation of the linear regression model for calculating ΔTi from the estimated values of ΔFi.
Probably I have misunderstood something?

Pehr,
I think this may explain some of the issues. Let me try and see if I can explain. There are others here more experienced than I am who can jump in and tell me where I’m going wrong if they wish.
So, if we start at the beginning, Forster et al. (2013) used basic energy balance to estimate the forcing time series for various climate models. Essentially they use that
dF = dN + adT.
Now, once you have your forcing time series, you can then use it to determine how a model would respond to a change in external forcing. There are, however, two other things you need (for a simple model at least). You need to know the climate sensitivity, alpha, and the ocean diffusivity, kappa. Essentially, alpha tells you the feedback response when T changes by dT, and kappa tells you how fast the oceans warm and is used to represent the planetary energy imbalance. Essentially, if you apply a change in forcing dF, then if kappa is large (oceans warm quickly) the surface will warm more slowly, than if kappa is small (oceans warm slowly).
So, the basic energy balance equation is now
dF = alpha dT + kappa dT,
which you can rewrite as
dT = dF/(alpha + kappa).
What I think you’re trying to do is argue that because kappa dT = dN, that you can replace kappa with dN/dT. This, however, isn’t quite correct, because the above equation is only true in the absence of variability. It’s not correct that kappa = dN/dT.
It’s fairly easy to see why. Consider the following; you have a forced response plus some variability about this forced response. What happens if dT suddenly jumps up? Well, dN has to go down in order to conserve energy. If dT goes down, dN goes up. Therefore, energy conservation tells you that the variation of dT about the forced response is anti-correlated with the variation of dN about the forced response. In other words.
kappa =/= dN/dT.
What one could write is
kappa = dN_forced/dT_forced.
What M&F did was to represent variability by an additional term, epsilon, giving
dT = dF/(alpha + kappa) + epsilon.
There are two ways to look at this now. Those who would like to re-introduce dT into the RHS, need to remember that dN also depends on dT. Alternatively, the first term on the RHS really only includes the forced dT and dN, not the full dT and dN. Those are included through the residual, epsilon. If so, then dT does not appear explicitly on the RHS and there is no circularity.
I don’t know if that helps to clarify things. I would guess not, but it’s worth a shot.

ATTP,
Unfortunately, I have problems to get my equations correct. My apologies for causing confusion.
In my comment FEBRUARY 11, 2015 AT 10:49 PM the equation for a1 should be:
a1= ΔTe-(b ΔF*e+c αe+d κe)+a
In FEBRUARY 11, 2015 AT 11:08 PM the second equation should be:
ΔF= ΔN+ α ΔT
Thanks for your comment. I have some views on your reasoning that
kappa =/= dN/dT.
In fact, according to the energy balance model over the climate system we have:
ΔN= ΔF- α ΔT = κ ΔT => ΔT= ΔF/(α+κ)
This represents a steady state energy balance expressing ΔN at first as the input to the climate system at the top of the atmosphere and secondly as the output from this system to the deep sea.
You are right that those equations cannot be satisfied if we consider that the climate system is far from steady state, such as after a sudden change in ΔT due to internal variability. On the other hand, consider that internal variability could be described as a change in the value of κ, then it is possible that the steady state equations will remain approximately satisfied (quasi steady state) while both ΔT and ΔN adjust to their new values.
From the information in Forster et al. (2013) the values of the climate feedback parameter α for the climate models used by M&F were determined independently from climate model simulation experiments on quadrupling of the carbon dioxide mixing ratio by linear regression of ΔN vs. ΔT using ΔN= ΔF- α ΔT as the linear regression model.
Values of α+κ, and then of course κ when α has been determined, were also determined independently from climate model simulation experiments on doubling the carbon dioxide mixing ratio by increasing this ratio by 1% per year. In that case, if I have not misunderstood it, ΔT was regressed vs. ΔF using ΔT= ΔF/(α+κ) as the linear regression model.
However, to my understanding, both ΔTi values and estimated ΔFi* values used by M&F were obtained by using climate model simulations for the historical period, basically the twentieth century. This raises two questions.
The first question is how the fact that ΔFi* depends on ΔTi according to ΔFi*= ΔNi + αi ΔTi influences their results.
The second question is how the tuning of the climate models in order to account for the temperature curve over this historical period will influence their results. This tuning may result in a dependence between the climate feedback parameter αi values for the climate models and there ΔFi values as I have discussed in previous comments.
These are, in my view, the background and the questions raised. But I am still far from having a founded opinion on what the final answers to those questions are.

Pehr,
This represents a steady state energy balance expressing ΔN at first as the input to the climate system at the top of the atmosphere and secondly as the output from this system to the deep sea.
The above is kind-of wrong. The input to the system is actually dF. This produces a TOA imbalance which causes the temperatures to rise, which reduces this imbalance by alpha dT. The remaining imbalance is then dN, so that
dN = dF – alpha dT,
or
dF = dN + alpha dT.
If you add variability, then dT can bounce around, but this causes dN to also bounce around so that
dF = dN + alpha dT.
So, if you then use this energy conservation to determine dF, and then reverse engineer this to determine the temperature response, given a known dF timeseries, you lose the information about the variability as all you have is the external forcing., which shouldn’t depend on internally driven variations in dT.
On the other hand, consider that internal variability could be described as a change in the value of κ
I don’t think kappa can change as it’s (on short timescales) a constant that tells you how energy diffuses into the ocean. Now, if there is variability, that would typically be because of some kind of ocean cycle releasing energy, increasing dT and reducing dN, or vice versa. So, I do think you should think of it as
dT = dF/(alpha + kappa) + epsilon,
where the first term is the forced response, and the second is the variability.
Anyway, that’s my understanding at least.

ATTP,
You wrote:

I have another opinion on this. ΔF is a theoretical concept in climate science and may only be seen as an input to the climate system on certain occasions. One such occasion is if you look at the system when it is assumed to have changed from one equilibrium state to another.
Another occasion is in a carbon dioxide doubling experiment. Then ΔF= ΔN at time zero but afterward the input equals ΔN that differs from ΔF due to the effect of climate feedback.
The theoretical basis for ΔF is a linearization of ΔN as a function of ΔT. That is the origin of the equation ΔN= ΔF- α ΔT defining ΔF as the temperature independent term.
Considering the steady state energy balance model discussed here we have that ΔN at the top of the atmosphere equals the difference between incoming radiation from the sun and outgoing radiation in the form of long wave infrared radiation and reflected short wave radiation (usually in units W/m2).
At the bottom of the mixed ocean layer ΔN equals the heat transfer rate from the mixed layer to the deep sea. It is assumed that the average temperature difference between the mixed layer and the deep ocean is the driving force for this heat transfer. It is of course possible to imagine that the heat transfer conditions may change, that is that κ may change.

Except, what the climate models are doing is assuming that it exists (or, rather, they’re calculating the radiative influence of external factors like increasing CO2). You might dispute whether or not it exists in reality, but I’m not sure how you can dispute its existence in the models since it’s imposed upon them.

But I have not disputed the existence of ΔF as an input to climate models.

Possibly, but dF is the input. In the absence of a temperature response, dF = dN. As the temperature rises, it then becomes
dF = dN + a dT.
So, dF is the constant, externally imposed forcing, and dN and dT are what vary.
It’s possible that we’re saying the same thing in different ways, though.

I disagree. In the Andrews et al. (2012) the forcing ΔF is an output from the study obtained by linear regression of ΔN vs. ΔT. They write in the first sentence in the abstract:
We quantify forcing and feedbacks across available CMIP5 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) by analysing simulations forced by an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.
My point is that although you know that the change in carbon dioxide forces the climate system you must also determine what this means in the form of energy flux at time zero in W/m2. This is found as output from the climate models, not as input.

But without making a very specific assumption about dN, cov(dT, dN) should not be zero. You seem to be asserting a peculiar regression structure in which the two indep’t variable have no covariance to the dep’t variable. This is not impossible, of course, but seems unusual.

I’m not sure that I’m saying what you think I’m saying. In physics speak 🙂 if climate models conserve energy and if the climate sensitivity is time-independent, then if there is a change in forcing, dF, following by a change in temperature, dT, the change in planetary energy imbalance should be
dN = dF – a dT.
Therefore, if one wants to determine the change in forcing from in a climate model, one can do so using,
dF = dN + adT,
and as long as the conditions I specified at the beginning of this comment are true, then this should return a reasonable estimate of the actual change in external forcing. Also, since dF is the radiative response to a change in something external (in the absence of a temperature response) it is – by definition – independent of dT and, therefore, so is dN + adT.
Of course, climate models don’t conserve energy exactly, and alpha isn’t completely time-independent, so a more interesting question might be how would affect the analysis in M&F, but I don’t think this is sufficient to argue that the method in M&F is wrong. I also think that a lot of this has been covered before (in Forster et al. 2013, for example).

In this study both α and κ are assumed to be constants for each of the models. α tells the total feedback as seen in the particular model between two equilibrium states of the model. Both states are represented by averages over long periods. When the models have internal variability, that may lead also to variability in the relationship between surface temperature and TOA imbalance whose equilibrium average values are described by α. Thus the relationship
ΔF= ΔN+ α ΔT
is valid for the long term averages (at least for that pair of states that’s used to define α), but not necessarily over shorter term. How well it’s valid for the 15 year trends (or 62 year trends) must be uncertain to some extent, perhaps to a quite significant extent. Leaving the correction out would, however, not be correct even on the average. As we are discussing model properties, the deviations may differ from a model to another.
The calculation does not use separate values αi for each period. If such values were known, then we knew the actual ΔFi as well, but that’s unfortunately not the case. For this reason the values of ΔF used in the regression are not exactly the forcings, but an operationally defined substitute of somewhat unknown nature. It’s probably a better substitute for the 62 year trend than for the 15 year trend.

Pekka,
I agree with that. Especially I am also considering that αi and κi have constant values for each model i that are not changing for different time intervals.

Piers and Jochem,
I would like to ask if the ΔF derived from the models in Forster (2013) is the same ΔF value used in 2015, either in average or directly model to model, (if any models were the same). Also, if they were the same models if they all had the same internal values in both studies.
Thx

From the paper we can read that values from Forster (2013) are used in the analysis. That statement is just below equation (1) in a sentence that ends .. and is used here.

Professor Marotzke:
Your paper refers to the primed variables below as the “cross-ensemble variation”. Does this mean that they are calculated as follows?
ΔF’ = ΔF_overbar – ΔF
α’ = α_overbar – α
κ’ = κ_overbar – κ
where ΔF was obtained as described above and α and κ were known from earlier work. The quantities with an overbear are the ensemble mean, but the other quantities vary with model (but not the model run).
If not, a better explanation for cross-ensemble variation would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Ed, I am puzzled by the result here that temperature trends do not depend much on ocean heat uptake and feedback parameters. That seems to me to be counterintuitive. Is there a simple explanation as to why that result makes sense?

If I’m understanding the bottom line it’s that a test has been constructed of the behavior of the variables in the models using ΔF as the independent variable and The First Law as the pretext for the equation. The controversy is if the test will give meaningful results is ΔF is pre-constructed from the variables being tested (from the same models or averages of them). The conclusion is partly ambiguous because of:
1) the degree of pre-construction contained in ΔF,
2) that if the equation itself being an undeniable assumption, being energy conservation, that assures the cancellation of any circularity,
3) If the assumption of 2 is invalid considering the lack of knowledge of the inner workings of the model being tested.
The conclusion for now is that all three of the above problems have been adequately satisfied to all’s satisfaction (except mine).

This is a cross-post of a recent comment I made at Climate Audit:
Pekka has written in several comments that “the calculations of M&F are stable (robust might be more accurate) and without significant problems from circularity”, and asserts (I think correctly) that Marotzke and Forster agree with him about this. He has also now clarified mathematically what he is arguing.
If I understand correctly, Pekka argues that the fact that ΔF is a linear function of ΔT does not involve a circularity since it is the actual model-simulated ΔT (ΔTs) that is used to calculate ΔF, not the purely forced, free-of-internal-variability-etc-error, version of ΔT (ΔTf), which is what the regression fit represents (if the regression model is appropriate). I will explain why Pekka’s argument does not support the conclusions of Marotzke and Forster in relation to 62 year periods.
Suppose that over the 62 year period involved simulated multidecadal internal variability leads to ΔTs exceeding ΔTf in some models and falling below it in other models, without the simulated value of ΔN (ΔNs) being similarly affected. This seems both plausible and likely; many models exhibit substantial multidecadal internal variability, and show little correlation between multidecadal ΔTs and ΔNs (after detrending).
In this situation, models with ΔTs > ΔTf will generally have a relatively high diagnosed value (ΔFs) for ΔF, since ΔFs = α ΔTs + ΔNs. (Note that although Marotzke and Forster write of α ΔT being a “correction” to ΔN, it is the larger of the two terms in most cases.) As a consequence of such internal variability, intermodel spread in ΔTs will be positively related to that in ΔFs, increasing the proportion of the intermodel spread in ΔTs that is “explained” by the ΔFs, or the “contribution to the regression by the ERF trend”, which Marotzke and Forster state is dominant for start years from the 1920s onward. This effect is what I refer to as circularity; it is not total and I did not claim that it was.
I consider a contribution to intermodel spread in ΔTs that arises purely from the same elements of internal variability appearing on both sides of the regression equation to be an artefact of an unsatisfactory method. Perhaps on reconsideration Pekka may also come to this view.
Whether the circularity element that exists in the regression method used is the largest source of error in this study is uncertain. I identified other potentially serious sources of error involved in it; they may be more important. Paul_K has set out further issues with the study’s methods.
Note that it would be unsurprising if Marotzke and Forster has just found that the ERF trend ΔFs has a considerably larger influence than model feedback strength and model ocean heat uptake efficiency over historical 62-year periods starting from the 1920s on. Aerosol forcing varies hugely between models (by over 1 W/m2). Up to the turn of the century, 62-year ΔTs trends have a correlation of 0.9 with diagnosed or estimated aerosol forcing levels for the models used by Marotzke and Forster. And over the entire Historical simulation period, 1860-2005, ΔTs trends have as high a correlation with aerosol forcing strength in models as with ΔFs.
However, that intermodel differences in the ERF trend have to date had a considerably larger influence than those in model feedback strength would not justify Marotzke’s claim: “The difference in sensitivity explains nothing really”. And even if variations in model sensitivity explain relatively little of the intermodel spread over the Historical period that would not justify his statement that “The claim that climate models systematically overestimate global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations is wrong”. It is entirely possible that systematically-excessive model sensitivities have until recently been largely offset by systematically-excessive aerosol forcing and/or obscured by a positive influence of actual multidecadal internal variability on observed GMST.

The problems arise in the way Nic describes above, because he does not follow the actual steps that are taken in the analysis that starts by Forster et al (2013) and continues in the paper discussed in this thread. The actual procedure is clear and robust, but there are some issues related to the interpretation and use of the resulting regression formulas.
I believe that the following describes correctly the essential steps of the analysis, but there may be some further details that I’m unaware about.
The regression model is defined in such a way that it implies that ΔF of the is operationally defined as
ΔF = ΔN + α ΔT
where all variables are from the diagnosed properties of the particular model and model run for the period considered. Based on that the residual of the regression formula is calculated as
e = ΔT – a – b ΔF – c α – d κ
or equivalently with the operational definition of ΔF
e = (1 – bα)ΔT – a – b ΔN – c α – d κ
(This is a point, where Nic seems to be proposing different formulas that make the regression less robust.)
The regression coefficients are determined by searching coefficient values that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals summing over all model runs for the period considered.
When the calculation is done as I describe, it’s robust, but as I note above, Nic seems to propose that a different approach should be used.
Now we have the regression formula
ΔT = a + b ΔF + c α + d κ
The coefficients are robustly determined, but we have a problem. ΔF used in the step of determining the formula was defined operationally by a formula that does not correspond to standard definition of forcing. As acknowledged by Martotzke and Forster in their response above
Of course one could legitimately ask how accurate this correction is, and we would hope that in future generations of coordinated model simulations a better direct diagnostic of F is possible. But for the CMIP5 models used in our study and in Forster et al. (2013), applying equation (3) has been the only approach possible.
They continue to discuss arguments to support their approach and the significance of this issue in their response. (Read it, if you don’t remember the text.)
The problem that Nic is discussing reappears here in the way that ΔN calculated from the formula
ΔN = ΔF – α ΔT
is not any more the same as in the model run, when ΔF is chosen as the same. Thus the case described by the regression model is not the same as the corresponding original one. We might try to fix the case by using the original ΔN, but that leads to a different case again, and is actually inconsistent with the way the regression was preformed.
My intuition tells that the problems are quantitatively small, if the product bα is significantly less than 1 for a dominating majority of the model runs for each period. In the opposite case the results may be less significant.

Nic,
Maybe you should think about the physical meanings of the terms dF and dN. I can’t see why replacing something that is assumed to be known a priori (dF) with something that is not known a priori (dN) is a standard way to do linear regression. By a priori, what I mean is that it is possible to know the radiative influence of the external drivers before running the models, even though this isn’t what is actually done. This is not true for dN.
Also if you do want to do both regressions in a single step, I don’t see how you can move a dT (which together with dN constrains dF) from the RHS – where it is given by the model output – to the LHS where it is not. In doing so it would seem that RomanM is assuming that temperature changes are being driven by dN, which is not correct, they’re being driven by dF.

…even though this isn’t what is actually done.
I’m not sure that you are on the same page as Pekka Pirila’s comment below since he seems to be criticising others for not precisely following the procedures used by M&F.
The fact that exogenous forcing, as a matter of physics, drives global temperature does not change the fact, also as a matter of physics, that feedbacks largely determine equilibrium temperature under any given forcing scenario. Therefore, to accurately model global mean surface temperature you must get the feedbacks “right.”
Yet this apparently has no bearing on the results of the M&F analysis of model simulations, despite their selected samples displaying a 300 percent range in feedback magnitude. They state:
…we find no substantive physical or statistical connection between simulated climate feedback and simulated GMST trends over the hiatus or any other period…
They calmly accept this extraordinary result and reject claims that climate models overestimate human contributions to radiative forcing. Even though they seem to be discounting the possibility that their required internal variability adjustment is actually (in whole or in part) a feedback parameter missing from the model inputs, it appears that no realistic magnitude of feedback would change their results. Given the profound implications of their conclusions, independent reproduction of their results is both a scientific and public policy imperative.

opluso,
I have discussed these issues with aTTP also on his blog. We are in agreement at least on the conclusion that the analysis of Marotzke and Forster is internally consistent and that the claims of circularity are based on a different model invented by the critics. The choices of M&F are reasonable, those of the that alternative are not.
Having said that, i think that the model is extremely crude, and that there are issues acknowledged also by the authors that may affect the conclusions. These effects may be substantial in my personal mainly intuitive judgment. More reliable results require at least significantly more work based on what’s known about the CMIP5 model runs, and possibly additional model runs that may be too expensive in resource requirements to be performed for these models.
When new inter-model comparisons are done, more information will surely be recorded. At that stage a better analysis is also possible, but that’s of now help right now.

oplus,
I’m largely in agreement with Pekka. My argument is not that M&F has no problems (although I would argue that they address most of the possible issues in the paper) my point is simply that the circularity argument made by Nic Lewis ignores that this issue is largely removed by an assumption of energy conservation that allows one to estimate the external forcings, and – as Pekka points out – the criticism is also based on an alternative model suggested by the critics that would not actually allow you to address what M&F are trying to do.
Pekka Pirilä says:

It may be clarifying to look at the the (counter factual) case that the relationship between ΔF and ΔN is precise for the normally defined physical parameters. In that case the same formulas could still be written. The arguments of Nic and RomanM could still be written. They do not discuss the inaccuracy of the replacement. That leads, however, to a paradox:
When the relationship is exact, there’s no reason to consider ΔN in any way more primary information than ΔF. According to their argument out of two equally primary alternative choices one leads to circularity, while the other does not. That paradox shows, that there’s something wrong on the argument.
What’s wrong is hinted at in one of Nic’s own comments. He notices that the statistical model of residual noise changes in some of the transformations, but that’s not a minor detail but that’s whole key for understanding where their conclusions originate.
The estimation depends on the statistical model of the residuals. The basic assumption of M&F is that the statistical properties of the residual are the same for each model run, when the residual is defined as they define it. I have emphasized in many of my comments that the regression depends on the formula for calculation the residuals, when the rest is ordinary linear regression.
The choice of the way the residual is calculated is determined by the implied assumption that it’s due to internal variability that is correctly scaled in the choice that they have made. The relationship between ΔN and ΔF is assumed to be given by the original formula using there the observer temperature, not something corrected by the residual.
This is a physics based assumption. It may be right or wrong, but only the physics as it’s presented by each model can tell the full answer for that. If the difference ΔF-ΔN depends on the same internal variability that leads to the residual, then the formula should be modified to reflect that. There’s, however, little reason to think that replacing ΔT by (ΔT-e) would be the correct way of doing that, or at least no one has presented evidence for that.
When we consider this paper, we should recognize all the assumptions made in it. We may criticize the choices and argue that some other choices lead to better description of CMIP5 ensemble, or that no proposed parametrization is fit to the analysis presented in the paper. That’s all legitimate, when arguments are given to support each point.
The claim of circularity as presented by Nic and RomanM is, however, not correct, but based on proposing a different model that leads to problems and claiming that the conclusions should be based on their model and actually rejected, because their model has circularity.

Acknowledging CMIP5’s purpose in essence is to facilitate the understanding of complex climate feedbacks, an undeniably international concern, and in doing so naturally has sacrificed the adversarial rigor that we hope is apparent and appreciated by all this forum.
In light of the above I respectfully as the following:
1) Do the authors acknowledge the statistical uncertainties that have been brought to light and agree or disagree their approach be recommended for future work?
2) Do the authors acknowledge that their work cannot be reported as to be as having tested all CMIP5 models as reported by Science News Daily and perhaps others?
3) Can the authors provide their explanation of the approach in their selection of 36 of the 56 coupled models and the identity of the one model not listed in Nature, along with their selection of which forcings derived in 2013 that they chose not to use and which forcing they chose to derive fresh, and any other selective actions not published?
4) Do the authors agree the claim that this paper proved: “ Climatologists have been fairly correct with their predictions” as reported Science News Daily and others?
5) Does the moderator or others have a view as to whether the an author’s response is warranted?

The problem here is statistical in nature. It has nothing to do with physics or which variables are external or internal or when they are observable or what drives what. If there are flaws in the way the data reflects the “physics”, this is a different situation which should have been dealt with before ever submitting the publication.
The authors have provided a data set and a statistical model which underlies the data and the relationships between those variables and the analysis of that data is done within the context of the statistical model. From this juncture on, it is purely a mathematical and a statistical problem.
The basic relationship in this model is given by the equation
ΔT = a + b ΔF + c α + d κ + ε
It contains several unknown parameters and a variable ε (usually termed the “error”) which accounts for the “random” variation in the model.
The intent of the analysis is to determine how much of the variable ΔT can be accounted for by a given set of other variables. In order to do this, the unknown parameters need to be estimated along with estimates of the values of ε. The authors have chosen to use Least Squares methodology to do this.
The starting point for this analysis was an error sum of squares. Its format is not an arbitrary choice by the authors, but rather based on certain optimal properties of the solution within the model structure.
SSE = ∑ε^2 = ∑[ΔT –(a + b ΔF + c α + d κ)] ^2
This quantity is minimized with respect to the unknown parameters a, b, c and d. From these we can estimate the values of ε and calculate the predicted values of ΔT along with the residuals = Observed( ΔT) – Predicted(ΔT).
It should be pointed out that there is a distinction between the residuals and the estimated errors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics). In ordinary linear regression, they are the same, however this need not always be the case in least squares methodology.
Now, it turns out that in this data set, there is an identity relating three of the variables: ΔF = α ΔT + ΔN. If we substitute this identity into the above SSE, and rearrange terms, we get
SSE = ∑ε^2 = ∑[(1 – b α) ΔT – (a + b ΔN + c α + d κ)]^2
This is not the sum of squares of a “new model”. It is exactly the same SS as that above with exactly the same unknown parameters and exactly the same ε’s and exactly the same relationships between variables in the data set . Describing it as “a different model invented by the critics” indicates a lack of understanding of statistical models and of the mechanics of least squares methodology in general.
Since the two sums of squares are just two representations of the same equation, the following principle seems to be quite evident. If the presence of the hidden relationship between ΔT and ΔF in the data has no effect, then minimizing the latter SS must produce the same estimates of the unknown parameters and ε’s as the former.
The two minimizations do not produce the same results. In particular, the residuals for the latter SS are now dependent on the individual climate model’s α: res = ε’/( 1 – b’ α) where the ‘ denotes an estimated value. This clearly indicates that there is a systematic effect on the residuals due to α which is not been accounted for in the equation coefficient c. You will also note that in this case, the residuals in fact are not the same as the estimated errors terms.
I have pointed out exactly where the shortcomings occur when applying the standard regression calculations to the data in the comment linked by Nic Lewis. (http://climateaudit.org/2015/02/05/marotzke-and-forsters-circular-attribution-of-cmip5-intermodel-warming-differences/#comment-751723) The analysis using the revised form of the SS takes this into account, but unfortunately there are other effect present in the results (such as bias) which are due to the fact that the minimization procedure has become non-linear because of the circularity in the data.

Roman,
Three questions.
1. Does the linear regression used by Forster et al. (2013) guarantee that dF=dN + adT exactly. Your substitution would seem to require this to be the case?
2. If you move the term (1-b alpha) back to the RHS of the form that you regard as equivalent, does the RHS respresent a reasonable form for how external forcings plus internal variability will drive increases in temperature?
3. The actual goal of M&F was to determine how much of the spread in model trends could be due to the spread in model forcings and how much was due to something else (internal variability). How does your modified form address this question?

In slightly different words.
The assumption of M&F is that ΔF for each model run is obtained from ΔN and ΔT of that model run. All these values come from the CMIP5 database. They do not vary during the determination of the model. There’s explicitly no feedback.
When the model has been determined it’s taken to be a model that links ΔF to the estimates of ΔT.
No analysis is done related to the values of ΔN any more. ΔN is not part of the further analysis, and it cannot be part of a feedback equation.

A few more words about the physics.
The TOA imbalance is almost identical to the net energy flux into the ocean, because the heat capacity of the atmosphere is small. The net heat flux into the ocean varies rather strongly due to the El Niño -La Nina variability and other forms of variability that are present also in the models. Therefore N is not very stable. F is expected to be more stable. That’s possible, because surface temperatures vary due to the same processes that cause N to vary.
Whether the values of calculated from the formula used F are, indeed, more stable that the values of N can be checked. The authors write in their response
Not correcting for the increased back radiation would, on physical grounds, imply using N, which contains the very contribution from the surface response T that we must eliminate in our estimate of F.
The paper Forster et al (2013) contains timeseries of the forcing obtained by this approach, but not those of TOA imbalance to compare with.

RomanM,
The model is different, because you assume that the new ΔT obtained from the model should be used to determine ΔF, while the M&F assumption is that the estimate of ΔF given by the original data from CMIP5 data base gives the result that should be used at every later step.
Which of the two alternatives is the correct choice is an issue of physics, not of statistics.

Apologies for butting in, but I don’t think he’s doing anything of the sort. You wrote further upstreams that the following formula for the residuals is “equivalent” to that used in the paper
e = (1 – bα)ΔT – a – b ΔN – c α – d κ.
But this is not fit for simple use with linear regression, which is what they claim to use in the paper. Roman has explained this already. For myself I would say that dT can not be written as a linear combination of the parameters and use another tool.
If the above equation is not valid, then we’re in a different situation altogether. In my humble opinion it’s approaching the point where input from the authors is needed.

Although there is disagreement on whether one can excuse avoidance of statistical orthodoxy, as I believe some are saying, by the circumstance of the physics being represented, I think it is universally agreed to be important that the physics be accurately represented mathematically. It has been pointed out by Greg Goodman at http://climateaudit.org/2015/02/05/marotzke-and-forsters-circular-attribution-of-cmip5-intermodel-warming-differences/#comment-751840 that the feedbacks in the models are not linear relationships. The ocean surface heat flux is known to oscillate as well as to become less responsive as temperature equilibrium with the air is approached. In addition, the change in TOA imbalance (TOAI) is itself non-linear as shown in the NASA graph at the link. Indeed this complex relationship made the forcing’s derivation a difficult task as the authors stated it is. And, it is another point of uncertainty as to whether all the model assumptions and the author’s interpretations were correct.
Do the author’s not agree that the models, as complex as they have become, do not approach nature’s complexity yet to be modeled? In fact, the authors conclude that this unknown portion, dubbed “natural variability,” is dominant over the models in the 15-year period. But isn’t it true that the models have been constructed with 56 groups of guesses based on trying to duplicate the behavior of GST over the past 150 years? And, as Nic Stokes pointed out, since most of the models have the ocean oscillations out of phase with each other the result is basically a linear guess of forcing mixed with artificially generated amplitude of noise? Are we to understand that the purpose of this paper and all the work being done to analyze is validity, in the end, is to see whether in fact the models have had enough noise added or if they need more?

In Forster et al. (2013), F13, there is data for 23 CMIP5 climate models. In Table 1 we find data for the climate feedback parameter α and the ocean heat uptake efficency κ. In Table 2, first column, we find data for the historical change in adjusted radiative forcing ΔF for the period 1860-2003 for each of the models. In Table 3 we find the corresponding temperature changes ΔT for the same period, which I refer to as ΔT_cmip5.
I made some calculations, FWIW, in order to compare the results of M&F for 62-year periods. This means that I calculated results for one 144-year period and compared with results for 62-year periods.
At first I calculated ΔT_eb for all 23 models according to the energy balance equation (1) in M&F
ΔT_eb= ΔF/(α+κ).
The internal variability ε according to the terminology of M&F and their equation (3) was calculated as
ε = ΔT_cmip5 – ΔT_eb.
Then I made a multiple linear regression using ΔT_eb as temperature data with the following regression model:
ΔT_eb=b0+b1 ΔF + b2 κ + b3 α
The regression result is
ΔT_eb,hat = 0.77 + 0.56 ΔF – 0.37 κ – 0.47 α with R2=0.98.
The unit of ΔT_eb,hat is K and its value refers to the temperature rise from 1860 to 2003. This must be remembered in comparing with the corresponding values for the 62-year periods of M&F given as trends with units K/decade.
This equation shows that a change in climate feedback parameter α in the climate model ensemble from its highest value of 1.79 W/(m2 K) to its lowest value of 0.63, corresponds to -0.47 (0.63-1.79)=0.55 K higher temperature 2003. A change in ΔF from lowest to highest value in W/m2 gives a temperature increase of 0.56 (2.5-0.8) = 0.95 K.
That result suggests that a too low climate feedback parameter, corresponding to a too high equilibrium climate sensitivity, may have a considerable effect. Both forcing and climate sensitivity seems to be important for how much the temperature change may be over the whole industrial period. In 62-year periods ending around 2003 the main part of the GHG-driven anthropogenic temperature rise is assumed to have occurred, so a similar pattern should perhaps be expected.
For further studying the spread in the ΔT-values, standard deviations of ε, 0.56 ΔF, 0.37 κ and 0.47 α were calculated as measures of the spread in ΔT_cmip5 due to natural variability, adjusted radiative forcing ΔF, ocean heat uptake efficency κ and climate feedback parameter α.
The calculated standard deviations for spread in ΔT_cmip5 with all effects and in ΔT_cmip5 due to ε, ΔF, κ and α are equal to
0.37; 0.19; 0.31; 0.09; 0.15;
This result seems to me to give a different pattern than from the 62-years results of M&F. ΔF, κ and α seem to result in more spread in relation to ε than in M&F for 62 year periods ending around 2003. Also κ and α seem to result in more spread in relation to ΔF than in M&F. Note again that only ratios of two spreads may be compared because M&F use other units.
See figure 3 in M&F.
Whether those differences are due to different calculation methods, different time intervals or mistakes on my behalf remains to be understood.

I have done some further calculations with respect to the Nature paper by Marotzke and Forster. This was done in order to hopefully gain some better understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of the results by M&F, which have received considerable attention.
Here I present calculations of the maximal deterministic temperature changes in the CMIP5 ensemble, analyzed by Forster et al. (2013), F13, due to variations in α, κ and ΔF. M&F define the deterministic temperature change as the temperature change given by the energy balance equation (1) in their paper:
ΔT_eb= ΔF/(α+κ)
A description of the relevant data in F13 and the justification for using them is found in this comment.
I have used four different methods for the calculations.
First method:
I used directly the energy balance equation ΔT_eb= ΔF/(α+κ). First I calculated the ensemble means ΔFe, αe and κe. Then the maximal change due to α was calculated as follows, using the minimal and the maximal values α_min and α_max from the climate model ensemble data.
ΔT_eb[maxch, α]=ΔFe/(α_min+κe)-ΔFe/(α_max+κe).
Corresponding calculations were carried out for ΔF and κ. The maximal temperature changes due to α, κ and ΔF became:
0.52; 0.44; 0.87 K
Second method:
Use of the linearized equation introduced by M&F:
ΔT_eb=ΔFe/(αe+κe) + ΔF/(αe+κe) – ΔFe/(αe+κe)^2 α – ΔFe/(αe+κe)^2 κ.
After inserting the numerical values we find:
ΔT_eb = 0.88 + 0.51 ΔF – 0.45 α – 0.45 κ.
The maximal temperature change for α is calculated as 0.45 (α_max- α_min) and correspondingly for ΔF and κ. The maximal temperature changes due to α, κ and ΔF became:
0.52; 0.48; 0.87 K
Third method:
I made a linear regression using the values of ΔT_eb as described in this comment:
This gave:
ΔT_eb,hat = 0.77 + 0.56 ΔF – 0.37 κ – 0.47 α with R2=0.98.
The maximal temperature changes due to α, κ and ΔF became:
0.55; 0.39; 0.95 K
Fourth method:
I made a linear regression as in the third method but by using the temperature values from the climate model ensemble ΔT_cmip5 instead.
This gave:
ΔT_cimp5,hat = 0.65 + 0.62 ΔF – 0.42 κ – 0.38 α with R2=0.72.
The maximal temperature changes due to α, κ and ΔF became:
0.44; 0.45; 1.06 K
Comments on the results
Regarding the choice of method for calculating the deterministic variations it seems to work well with the first method that is also easy to apply. However the second method also works well and the results show that the temperature variations are almost linear over the range of changes in the independent variables.
Linear regression seems to complicate the calculations. Anyway the third method gives reasonable results with not so much deviation from the two first methods. However, the fourth method gives less accurate results with more deviations. It is not completely clear what linear regression method M&F have been using.
As to the results, the two first methods suggest that the variations in the deterministic temperature due to α, κ and ΔF are of similar magnitude. The variations due to ΔF are greater than the other ones but at most with a doubled temperature change. This seems to differ from the pattern of the results in M&F.
The linear regression according to the third method gave similar results. Furthermore the regression results shows that all regression parameters formally have significant values, including the coefficients before α and κ (I say formally since there is a considerable error in ΔF and the evaluation of significance seems to be questionable). In the fourth case the less accurate regression gave results deviating more from the two first methods and the parameters for α and κ were not formally significant.
Thus, the choice of calculation method seems to be important for the possibility to draw conclusions from the results. In the worst case no formally significant temperature variations due to α and κ could be detected.

Pehr Björnbom says: “What if all the models have similar values of α and κ and that those values all correspond to greater climate sensitivities than in the real climate system? How would this influence the regression results with the linear regression model used:”
This is exactly the point I made above. The authors do not demonstrate that thier method is capable of detecting the influence of α and κ on any scale.
They use an untested “innovative” method and simply assume that it works and that it is capable of detecting the influence of the relative narrow range of α and κ in th CMIP5 selection in the presence considerable noise and further errors induced by the multiple linearisation assumptions.
Any new method must be tested before it is used and conclusions drawn.
It would be good to see them address that omission. Until they do so their study has no objective value.

It is also worth noting that the sliding “trend” analysis they are doing is actually a running mean of the rate of change. In fact it is applying two different low-pass filters to the rate of change of temperature.
In the case of the 62y running mean, this seems to be adequate. However, the running mean is a particularly poor filter that can introduce serious distortion into the result due to its inverting part of the data.
I discussed this in detail on Judith Curry’s site and suggested some improved alternatives.
http://judithcurry.com/2013/11/22/data-corruption-by-running-mean-smoothers/
Looking at the 1992 spike in their ensemble mean in figure 2a it is obvious that there is a lot variability remaining that is faster than the 15y filter they have applied .
This is clear evidence of the distortions typically produced by a running mean filter. This will be adding spurious noise to both model and HadCRUT “trends” that will be further degrading their results.
I don’t see obvious distortion in the 62y graphs ( whether it matters depends upon the frequency content of the data. ) so the running mean is probably an acceptable choice in that case. I would strongly suggest they choose a less distorting filter such as a gaussian or Lanczos for the 15y analysis.
Some of the differences they find between their 15y and 62y analyses are likely due to the poor choice of filter.
A first step is to recognise explicitly that what is being done is a study of low-pass filtered rate of change in temperature. The need to choose an appropriate filter then becomes self evident.
All is this notwithstanding, they need above all else to validate their method.

The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems not to be completely unfounded.
That is my take-home message from the Nature paper by Marotzke and Forster (2015) combined with the discussion here and on Climate Audit. My way of reasoning follows in summary.
Only a few model simulations show a temperature trend as low as observations during the last 15 years. Models with a low value of the climate feedback parameter α have a tendency to have lower values of the ERF trend. With a value of the ERF trend according to AR5 such a model should show an even higher temperature trend. On the other hand models with high values of α have a tendency to have higher values of the ERF trend. With an average value of the ERF trend from AR5 such a model should show an even lower temperature trend.
Thus using the ERF trend from AR5 for the last 15 years should give a still wider spread of temperature trends, with some even higher but some more even lower than the observed trend.
This suggests that there are likely several models that deviate from observations due to high climate sensitivity. This agrees with the evaluation of climate models by Stott et al. (2013) and with studies of climate sensitivity from observations, for example Skeie et al. (2014)

One thing the authors seem to have overlooked in their own graphs is the “predictions from regression” plot shown in figure 3b. There is a clear bifurcation into two groups at the end of the graph. The two groups are separated by white space indicating an interval of clear separation. They fail to report or diagnose this separation which is likely to be due to model sensitivity.
They discuss the “difference” between models and HadCRUT4 but never actually plot it. Leaving the reader to visually compare the two overlaid.
Using a standard gaussian filter instead of “innovative” methods, I looked at the difference of two groups of high and low sensitivity according to Forster & Gregory 2013. It shows that the recent divergence is clearly a function of TCS.
http://climategrog.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/cmip5_hi_grp_low_grp.png?w=800
This substantiates the hypothesis that the bifurcation in their fig 3b is indeed the signal they set out to detect, yet concluded was not there.
Their primary conclusion that “climate feedback leaves no traceable imprint on GMST trends ” is therefore erroneous.

Greg Goodman and others have shown with straight forward methods demonstrating that models with higher TCS also show the most aberration from observed and recorded historical GMST, on the whole, as well as from the last 15-years. As Greg observed, a simple magnification of the author’s Fig. 3 b graphic also shows bifurcation of the high TCS models from the low, invalidation the conclusion: [The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.] unless by “systematically” the author’s mean without exception. But, even that was not proved by this paper.
This paper is an affront to the long-held scientific gold standard that demonstration of power to predict is the only acceptable method for validation. Predicting the past or model simulation, no matter how innovative the method, is not the same as predicting the less corruptible and tunable future.
In one fell sweep the authors have announced validation of the models to the world press and attempted to push back the time frame for perhaps anticipated invalidation. Whether variability is “natural” or unforced has no bearing on predictability. It is not like locating an electron. Progress continues to be made in understanding Pacific Decedal Oscillation, ENSO and glaciation cycles. With these advances validation time as well as model simulation error bars will surely be tightened. Perhaps the “differences between simulated and observed trends are dominated by random internal variability over the shorter timescale…,” of15 years. This small (not widely contested) observation pertaining to CMIP5 little necessitates a global newsblast from the Max Plank Institute: “Global warming slowdown: No systematic errors in climate models.”
Since even lay-people assume science is supposed to be validated by empirical predictions it’s no wonder science reporters assumed such had been done from reading the MPI headline: “Skeptics who still doubt anthropogenic climate change have now been stripped of one of their last-ditch arguments.” Did the author’s write this? Did Max Plank I. allow Dr. Marotzke to review it? Surely they knew that millions of people would interpret that as the models tracking right on course.
This type of communication seems to be exactly what the late Richard Feynman spoke so passionately against. It is also of note that the paper is written to leave the impression that the values from obtained from the CMIP5 archive were the modelers’ or of other independent source rather than the author’s own work unless the reader followed to a footnote and researched.
The models never created information that could be used to test themselves with their own output or observed record since that was used, though indirectly, as input. My earlier comments about data selectivity I now find irrelevant as I find the paper’s foundation to be circular. Also, the argument about whether the First Law corrects circularity is moot; all values were derived from one variable (the time component being removed), delta T, insuring closure from identity. For the same reason I find Nic Lewis’s circular substitution and other arguments moot. Regardless of criticisms by Lewis and others the author’s attack above on Nic Lewis’s previous work is irreverent to the present paper and thus was uncalled for.
It is noteworthy that Pehr Björnbom above was unable to duplicate the results of the author’s regressions when using other alternative methods. Also, Pekka Pirila, subsequent to his comments here, and after two weeks attempting defense of the paper on climateaudit.org, summarized his findings in part: “Looking at the results, I have the suspicion that the CMIP5 ensemble cannot really answer the questions M&F try to figure out.” The rest is here: http://climateaudit.org/2015/02/05/marotzke-and-forsters-circular-attribution-of-cmip5-intermodel-warming-differences/#comment-752390

Lets just concentrate on the data rather than argue semantics. I have repeated the trend analysis for 15y and for 60y trends for Hadcrut4 . I then compared this to what would be expected by an underlying AGW term ~2.5ln(C/C0) and a PDO/AMO term (see here) together with CMIP5 model trends taken from your Extended Data figure 2. I am now downloading all CMIP5 runs to do this trend analysis properly
http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Compare.png
shows the result (so far)
While it is true that the AGW emerges from the 60y trend, the result are not really compatible with CMIP5 models after a start date of 1935. I am convinced that the current hiatus in warming is due to a downturn in the net AMO/PDO since 1998. This implies that models really are running too hot and underlying AGW has a TCR of ~1.7C

South Sudan Refugee Crisis Worsens As Allegations of Genocide Spread

UN cautiously labels South Sudan atrocities “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing” as crisis deepens
South Sudan Civil War: Refugees flee the atrocities – BBC News
The United Nations is cautiously describing the fighting in South Sudan as “genocide” or “ethnic cleansing” as reports surface of hundreds of South Sudanese refugees fleeing into neighboring Uganda. Political and ethnic in-fighting has consumed South Sudan since the collapse of a peace agreement in July of 2016, leading to deadly violence that has caused thousands to flee their homes. The situation is larger and graver than the refugee situation in Syria and Iraq as the logistical support for these refugees in the area is not only lacking, it is, in many places, nonexistent. A quarter of a million people inhabit the largest of the refugee camps and, in coordination with the United Nations HCR, the Ugandan authorities are attempting to provide basic necessities to those in the camps. You can donate to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) by clicking here.

Bernie Sanders 2020 Campaign Staff Unionizes—and Makes Presidential Campaign History
By Josh Eidelson and Bloomberg
March 15, 2019
Bernie Sanders’ 2020 campaign is recognizing a union of its staff, a first in the history of U.S. presidential campaigns.
“We’re honored that his campaign will be the first to have a unionized workforce,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in an emailed statement.
The campaign agreed to recognize the union, a local of the United Food and Commercial Workers, after a majority of staff signed cards over the past week. The bargaining unit was formed with around 45 employees, according to the union, and could grow to more than 1,000 as the campaign progresses.
“We expect this will mean pay parity and transparency on the campaign, with no gender bias or harassment, and equal treatment for every worker, whether they’re in Washington, D.C., Iowa, New Hampshire, or anywhere else,” UFCW Local 400 President Mark P. Federici said in an emailed statement.
Democratic campaign workers have notched a series of unionization victories in other races. Since the start of 2018, a new union called the Campaign Workers Guild has secured collective bargaining agreements with two dozen campaigns, including last year’s successful U.S. House bids by New York’s Max Rose and New Mexico’s Deb Haaland, and the re-election of Washington Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.
A senior adviser to Julian Castro’s presidential campaign, Jennifer Fiore, told the Daily Beast in January that the organization would support a union if its staff chose to form one.

My review for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
My review for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
REVIEW:
A real page turner!
I have loved this series. The first two books were not only an introduction of sorts into the witch and wizard world of Hogwart's, but a collection of small adventures.
This book is all that and more. It has a dark note. It takes the reader to the scariest depths of Hogwart's.
At this point, this book is my favorite. I can't wait to read on!
5/5

Such great animation!
There was always something going on in this movie. Even though it was a story I have seen played out a million times and a million different ways, they all are different too. This had more of a story. It was very magical and is definitely fun for the whole family.
Want to point out, Max, the dog, stole the show for me. He is so adorable, even if animation. Such a good dog.
This is one of those Christmas movies that you really can enjoy all year round. It has enough laughs, fun and morals to be played anytime. Plus there is nothing wrong with Christmas cheer in February.

REVIEW:
A superbly made movie!!
Seriously, the scenes were pretty phenomenal. It made for some pretty intense moments along the way. The space scenes were incredible. I loved how much real footage they used as well.
I thought I knew a lot about the moon landing of '69, though it was 8 years before my time. Even thought I knew a far amount about Neil Armstrong, but after watching this film, I realize I knew nothing at all.

SUSTAINABLE & IMPACT TOURISM INITIATIVES IN INDIA, NEPAL & BHUTAN
Our pledge for Sustainable Tourism
With the global emphasis on sustainability and combating climate change, our pledge creates a major opportunity to position the Indian tourism experience as a unique visitor takeaway, in low-impact settings. Tourism has the potential of being a non-polluting, sustainable, income provider for our country.
We pledge to work together with our valued customers, our business partners and local communities , with the expectation that tourism today will enable future communities and travellers to gain from sustainable, inclusive experiences.
We pledge to work with local organisations like Tarun Bharat Sangh to help rural communities move towards livelihood diversification, help them with job opportunities and raise their income levels by engagement with tourist activities and with the help of water conversation efforts.
We pledge to develop sustainable visitor strategies based on art, craft, cultural &amp; natural heritage and environment. care can hence target larger tourism yields, which could contribute significantly to conservation and to the rural sector in particular. Lack of hygiene and sanitation is a major irritant for foreign and domestic tourists. Therefore, creation of awareness, as well as making the requisite facilities available, will be given high importance by our company.
We will be working towards maximising social and economic benefits to the local community and minimise negative impacts
with the following indicators.
Indus Discoverers will actively support initiatives for social and community participation and development, including, among others, infrastructure, education, health, and sanitation.
Indus Discoveries will help employ local residents, including in management positions, wherever feasible. Training will be offered, as necessary.
Indus Discoveries will encourage local and fair trade services and goods for our clients.
Indus Discoveries will encourage the means for local small entrepreneurs to develop and sell sustainable products that are based on the area’s nature, history, and culture (including food and drink, crafts, performance arts, agricultural products).
To help preserve the intangible cultural heritage of India. Indus Discoveries will develop a code of behaviour for activities in indigenous and local communities , with the consent of, and in collaboration with the local communities and/or neighbourhood.
Indus Discoveries will implement a policy against commercial exploitation, particularly of children and adolescents, including sexual exploitation.
Indus Discoveries provides equal opportunities in recruitment and career growth to all segments of society, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, ethnicity and gender, while completely shunning child labour.
All employees, including contractual labour, are treated in accordance with national legislation and are paid a fair wage, with the minimum being in accordance with the law
The activities of our company do not jeopardise the provision of basic services such as water, energy or sanitation to neighbouring communities.
We try to maximise benefits to cultural and historical heritage and minimise negative impacts.
Indus Discoveries follows established guidelines and code of behaviour at culturally, ecologically or historically sensitive sites, in order to minimise visitor impact and maximise satisfaction .
Indus Discoveries does not encourage sale of Historical and archaeological artefacts, except as permitted by law.
Our company contributes to the protection of local, historical, archaeological, culturally and spiritually important properties and sites, as well as natural phenomena, and does not impede access to them by local residents.
We respect intellectual property rights of local communities whenever we uses elements of local art and tradition, architecture, or cultural heritage in its operations, design, decoration, food or shops.
We help maximise benefits to the environment and minimise negative impacts .

Our initiatives in Sustainable & Impact Tourism involve using Tourism as an agent for promoting the good of the communities by contributing to their socioeconomic and environmental sustainability and resiliency towards Climate Change. We follow the triple bottom line approach to sustainability with equal emphasis on People, the Planet and Profitability all at once. Our programs provide a beneficial impact on the people, the environment and their socioeconomic networks. We partner with local NGOs and organizations working on water, renewable energy and other conservation issues and help make a meaningful impact on their work by bringing global awareness. Experts, donate equipment and volunteers to their projects. All programs have opportunities for educational learning and sharing knowledge as well as tourism in both the local area and in the country.
We offer the following opportunities to our tour participants at targeted villages, schools, farms, artisan communities and wildlife/ nature conservation venues:
• Planting Trees to create green zones in arid and semiarid areas in various areas in Nepal and in Rajasthan, India such as Alwar with local participation.
• Water Conservation for daily use, agriculture, crop rotation and cultivation of native plants. Chattar Sagar and Alwar in Rajasthan in collaboration with local projects.
• Water Purification initiatives with donations of advanced water purification devices as a part of WASH projects. At a school in Kashmir North India, local projects at various locations in Rajasthan where the water contains very high levels of Arsenic and Fluoride.
• Renewable Energy projects in targeted high potential areas such as schools, artisan villages, hospitals etc. with donated solar panels and mobile solar and water carts. Multiple projects in India, Nepal & Bhutan.
• Economic Development in local areas through sustainable tourism initiatives for eg creating global markets, tourism jobs and training in artisan communities.
• Exploring Water and Forest Conservation as well as Renewable Energy production in Bhutan and exchanging ideas, technologies and mindset with the Happiest Country in the World!
• Helping educate under privileged children and educating communities of general hygiene.
• Helping communities to preserve their age old customs and cultural heritage.
India, the world’s fastest growing major economy, must develop sustainably

The Hon. GREG PEARCE: I thank the Hon. Jan Barham for another detailed and very interesting question. I will refer it to the Minister for an answer. I look forward to reading the answer as much as the member does.
The Hon. GREG PEARCE: On 31 May 2011 the Hon. Jan Barham asked me in my capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, and Minister for Women a question without notice regarding kinship care.

What You Should Know About Buying Maryland Auto Insurance
How does your Maryland Auto Insurance Company determine the premium?
Two factors determine what you pay for Maryland auto insurance. The first factor is underwriting and the second factor is rating. Maryland Auto owners Insurance companies underwrite to assess the risk associated with an applicant, group the applicant with other similar risks and decide if the company will accept the application. Based on the results of the underwriting process, the rating assigns a price based on what the Maryland Car insurer believes it will cost to assume the financial responsibility for the applicants potential claim.
Several Factors Affect Your Risk Rating for Maryland Auto Insurance.
Your driving record, the area in which you live, your gender and age, marital status, prior insurance coverage, vehicle use and make and model of your vehicle all determine what your risk rating is for Maryland Car Insurance.
Ask if you are eligible for discounts for your Maryland Auto Insurance Company.
Discounts for Maryland Automobile Insurance may be available because you are considered a lower riskÃ‚Â, have multiple vehicles, driver education courses, are a student, your auto has safety devices, anti-theft devices, low mileage, you have a auto/home package. Some states do not allow discounts.
Tort System vs. No-Fault System
Each state must implement either a tort system or a no-fault system. The system your state has implemented will determine what kind of insurance is available to you. The three basic coverage's sold under the tort system are bodily injury liability insurance, property damage liability insurance and uninsured motorists coverage. In a no-fault state, coverage's will vary, but under a no-fault system your insurance company pays you directly for your losses as a result of injuries sustained in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. Check with your state insurance department for questions concerning tort or no-fault state systems.
Check Into Optional Coverage for Maryland Auto Insurance.
The most commonly recognized coverage's, in addition to the basic liability package, are collision and comprehensive coverage. Collision coverage pays for physical damage to your car as a result of your auto colliding with an object such as a tree or another car. This is relatively expensive coverage and is not required by law. Maryland Auto Insurance Comprehensive coverage pays for damage to your auto from almost all other causes, including fire, severe weather, vandalism, floods and theft. This coverage will also cover broken glass and windshield damage. Maryland Car Insurance comprehensive coverage is less expensive than collision, but is also optional. Other optional coverage's include medical payments coverage, rental reimbursement coverage and towing and labor coverage.
Shop Around Before You Buy Cheap Maryland Auto Insurance
When shopping for Maryland auto insurance, premium quotations are a useful tool for comparison of different Maryland Auto Insurance companies products. When asking for price quotations, it is crucial that you provide the same information to each agent or company including description of your vehicle, its use, your drivers license number, the number of drivers in your household, the coverage's and limits you want for your Maryland Auto Insurance.
Protect yourself when buying Maryland Auto Insurance.
Before signing an application for any Maryland Auto insurance coverage, call you Maryland state insurance department and verify that the Maryland Auto Insurance Company and the agent are licensed to do business in your state. It is illegal for unlicensed insurers to sell insurance, and if you buy from an unlicensed insurer, you have no guarantee that the coverage you pay for will ever be honored.
Read Your Maryland Auto Insurance Policy Carefully
You should be aware that a Maryland auto insurance policy is a legal contract. It is written so your rights and responsibilities, as well as those of the insurance company, are clearly stated. When you purchase Maryland Auto Insurance, you will receive a policy. You should read that policy and make certain you understand its contents. If you have questions about your Maryland Auto insurance policy, contact your insurance agent for clarification. If you still have questions, call your Maryland state insurance department.

DOE against any withdrawal from fossil waters
The Department of Environment opposes any withdrawal from renewable or non-renewable fossil water resources until further notice.
Isa Kalantari
(Iran's Environment News Agency) -The Department of Environment opposes any withdrawal from renewable or non-renewable fossil water resources until further notice, Mehr quoted DOE chief Isa Kalantari as saying on Monday.
Kalantari considered the lack of appropriate scientific knowledge and practical experiences regarding fossil waters – both domestically and internationally – and also, the potential negative effect of mere technical approaches on the environment – as has been proved in the past with projects like dam building and desalination – as the two main reasons behind this decision.
The country needs to place a primary focus on decreasing water usage and demand, rather than increasing the water supply through withdrawing water from new resources, emphasized the chief of environment.
Meanwhile, Kalantari called for more researches in this field to shed light on the possible environmental, economic and social consequences of removing fossil waters.

Planning for Special Needs Children
It has been said that the best inheritance we can give our children is a few minutes of our time every day. It’s also true, though, that our children will not always have us in their lives.
Children with special needs may require lifetime assistance, which can necessitate that parents prepare for their child’s care after they are gone, or are unable to care for him or her any longer.
Envisioning a Life Without You
Parents have to think about the potential needs of their surviving child. Will he or she require daily custodial care? Ongoing medical treatments? Will their child live alone or in a group home? Can family assume some of the care?
Answers to these and other questions can help form the vision of what may need to be done to plan for your child’s care.
Planning Your Estate
Supporting lifetime needs can outstrip your resources. One funding resource is government benefits, which your child may qualify for when he or she becomes an adult, e.g., Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid.
Because such government programs have low asset thresholds for qualification, you may want to consider whether to make property transfers to your special needs child.
Ensure you have an up-to-date will that reflects your wishes. Consider creating a special needs trust, the assets of which can be structured to fund your child’s care without disqualifying him or her from government assistance.1
Involve the Family
All affected family members should be involved in the decision-making process. You will want a united front of surviving family members to care for your child after you’ve passed.
Identify a Caregiver
In order for caregivers to make financial and healthcare decisions after your child reaches adulthood, the caregiver must be appointed as guardian. This can take time, so contemplate starting early.
Consider a “Letter of Intent” to the caregiver and family to express your wishes, along with information about your child’s care. This isn’t a legal document, but it may help to communicate your desires. Store this letter alongside your will in a safe place.
Planning for a special needs child can be complicated, confusing, and even overwhelming. Be sure to work with qualified professionals to help you navigate the myriad considerations that come with this challenge.
Using a trust involves a complex set of tax rules and regulations. Before moving forward with a trust, consider working with a professional who is familiar with the rules and regulations.

Sweet seventeen
Yesterday was Older Daughter's seventeenth birthday! Yes, my baby is growing up (*sob*).
We had a small ice cream cake. Notice Lydia's attentive presence.
It's starting to become a group effort to light all the candles!
One...two...three...
...BLOW!! (Yeah right, wait until there are fifty candles to blow out!)
We didn't do anything special yesterday except drive through a surprisingly nasty snowstorm to see some friends perform in a high school play.
It was a charmingly hokey comedy called Heaven Help the Po'Taters, and the kids put their hearts and souls into it. A very fun evening.
But Older Daughter's real birthday present will come on Saturday, when I'm taking a bunch of kids into the city to see The Hobbit. They can't wait!

I'd like to see The Hobbit, but I'd have to go alone. Hope you have a wonderful time.
Happy Birthday to your Daughter! ♥

Happy birthday to Older Daughter. My girls were invited to go with friends on Monday. It was 2 hours away so my husband got to go also since someone had to drive them there! I'll bide my time and wait until they all come out. I can't stand an unfinished story.

Happy Birthday Older Daughter! I have to admit, I sorta hope a little bit of ice cream cake dropped to the floor. Hey, our faithful furry companions are probably as happy as anyone else that we've made it through another year of life. As you get closer to spreading your wings and leaving the nest I wonder if Lydia will ever completely rest if/when you move away from home. You're a lovely young gentlelady full of grace. Wishing you many happy returns!

To be an individualist and libertarian is to understand that no one, anywhere, should ever be aggressed against by anyone, and that the state is the principal form of institutionalized aggression in our world.— Anthony Gregory

TRUMP’S FOLLEY
Posted on January 9, 2019 January 9, 2019 Author Left WingerCategories Wake up America!Tags TRUMP'S FOLLEY
TRUMP’S FOLLY
After achieving a new low in Presidential insincerity with his border-wall address to the nation, Donald Trump sat alone in the Oval Office. He knew that no-one other than his core supporters bought his fictions.
It should be noted that thanks to the prosperity Trump has brought to those supporters, most expect to have their Studebakers paid off in a couple of years.
Trump had hoped to bounce some new bulls**t off of his co-Presidents, Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, but the two lovebirds were unreachable in the Bahamas.
“TMZ” recently reported that Coulter fell in love with Rush when he told her, “You’re every bit as attractive as Norman Bates’s mother.”
Knowing that Trump had laid another egg, some Republicans met secretly to try and figure out how to end the shutdown. The meeting’s attendees planned to let the most respected Republican in the room chair the session, but then realized there aren’t any respected Republicans and went for their least respected member.
Mike Pence called the meeting to order. He looked under a desk and said, “Mitch, it’s safe to come out now. Nobody is going to actually ask you to do your job.”
McConnell felt relieved, but was terrified of the Hispanic waiters in the room serving coffee. After Kellyanne Conway frisked them, he was finally coaxed to slither out from under the desk. McConnell tried to stand, but ended up face down on the floor after stepping on several of his chins.
A panicked Sarah Sanders rose and told the room, “Look, we’ve got to do something because I’m running out of shutdown lies.”
The room gasped. The thought of her running out of lies was even more terrifying to them than helping poor people.
McConnell asked if anyone had any idea how to get the big orange baboon to change his mind. Minutes of silence ensued until one of the waiters asked, “Don’t any of you gringos have Putin’s number?”
The room erupted with applause.
Later that day the waiter was deported.

Expansion planned for biggest detention center in Southern California
July 11, 2014 July 11, 2014 / US Immigration / By US-Immigration.com
In a move that has resulted in harsh criticism from activists for immigration reform, an announcement has been made about an expansion to the Adelanto Detention Center. This is already the biggest immigration detention center in the whole of Southern California.
The center is situated in the desert, is currently able to hold almost 1,300 male detainees and is surrounded by barbed wire fences. The planned expansion will add another 650 beds and a new wing for female detainees, which will bring the center’s capacity close to 2,100. Advocates for immigration reform have already begun objecting to the planned expansion, arguing that the company in charge of the center has a history of neglect and a poor record when it comes to dealing with immigrants.
There has also been criticism about US Customs and Immigration Enforcement detaining 34,000 immigrants per day on a national level as required by a federal quota. Defund Detention Campaign coordinator Victoria Mena told Los Angeles NBC affiliate KNBC that the frustration of advocates is growing.
“To see that we’re still building centers like Adelanto, to just comply with this quota, is really sad,” Mena said. “We don’t need more immigration detention to fill the quota; what we need is to make smart, commonsense immigration reform happen.” Mena also points out the troubling death of an Adelanto detainee in 2012, which was shown to have been contributed to by a lack of adequate health care.

Maputo — The rural development project "Sustenta", launched in February 2017 now involves about 500 small scale farmers in five districts in the central province of Zambezia (Gurue, Ile, Gile, Mocuba and Alto Molocue), according to the provincial governor, Abdul Razak.
Speaking to AIM on Thursday, during a meeting in the southern city of Matola, drawing up a balance sheet on the 2017-2018 productive cycle of Sustenta, Razak said this is "an innovative project with an integrated approach".
Financing, he said, involves not only agriculture itself, but also support structures such as irrigation schemes, feeder roads and agricultural marketing "because we want the producers to have markets where they can sell. This is giving positive results".
Razak said that, in four of the five Zambezia districts covered, there are now 60 emerging commercial farmers, and that number will increase in the coming years.
"Each emerging commercial farmer must support the small farmers", he continued. There had been an impact not only in the production of maize, beans, sesame and soya but also in increased productivity.
Taking Zambezia as a whole, Razak said agricultural production in the province has risen from seven million tonnes in 2017 to an estimated 7.2 million tonnes this year. "We have produced enough to feed the province, to sell a surplus, and to hold some back for seed. This means that food security is guaranteed", he declared.
Razak believed that implementation of Sustenta in Zambezia has increased the productivity of crops. He attributed this to the combination of technical assistance and the kits of inputs given to the farmers. But even those farmers who had only benefitted from technical assistance experienced increased productivity.
Sustenta is also under implementation in five districts in the northern province of Nampula (Rapale, Ribaue, Malema, Mecuburi and Lalaua). The government has been encouraged by the progress and, as from next year, Sustenta will be expanded across the entire country.
Figures from the Thursday meeting showed a dramatic improvement in production. According to the Minister of Land, Environment and Rural Development, Celso Correia, average maize production across the country is 640 kilos per hectare. But farmers in the Sustenta project achieved an average of 1,210 kilos per hectare.
It was the same with soya - average production nationally is 414 kilos a hectare, but among the Sustenta farmers it rises to 1,185 kilos a hectare.
This has an impact in farmers' incomes. Outside of Sustenta, maize farmers earn 5,120 meticais (83.25 US dollars) per hectare. But for maize farmers benefitting from Sustenta, incomes rise to 9,920 meticais per hectare.

Feasibility of Matching Medicare and Medicaid Data for Dually Eligible Beneficiaries in Oregon Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Payment Methods and Spending in 20 States Resources for Public Comment: PHYSICIAN-FOCUSED PAYMENT MODEL TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE Continuing Care Retirement Communities: A Background and Summary of Current Issues Glossary of Terms
Cost-based reimbursement pays the facility for aggregate costs incurred for Medicaid eligible residents for allowable services.
Fee-for-service rates are determined by the number of hours of service identified in a care plan or a point system based on an assessment. For example, Kansas treats assisted living facilities as providers of home care services, and reimburses for the services delivered. This approach may be cumbersome for some facilities to implement because they are used to receive a regular monthly payment and providing resident services as needed pursuant to a plan of care. If services are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, facilities must track service delivery and prepare and submit bills to the payment agency. Depending on the pricing structure, assisted living facilities may not be set up to prepare and submit itemized bills for each increment of service delivered to each resident.
Service delivery in assisted living facilities also differs significantly from in-home service programs. Participants in home care programs typically receive services in block authorizations (e.g., 2 hours of care, 5 days a week). Assisted living residents typically receive services in 15-minute increments at various times 7 days a week including nights. Home care programs typically do not cover services at night, and, of course, cannot meet unscheduled needs.
Tracking, aggregating, and billing can become cumbersome and time consuming, especially for facilities used to charging a single all-inclusive service fee. However, the pricing structure of many facilities includes a basic package of services with additional charges based on the increments of service used by residents. Facilities with this policy for private-pay residents may be better able to participate in Medicaid programs that reimburse using a fee-for-service approach.
Eleven states use fee-for-service rates, examples of which are described below.
Arkansas allows personal care services to be provided through the state plan in a person's home "or other setting" such as a residential care facility (RCF). RCFs can be reimbursed for up to 64 hours of personal care per month.
In Missouri, personal care and advanced personal care services are reimbursed as a Medicaid state plan service in RCFs. Facilities are reimbursed at an hourly rate for the number of hours authorized in the care plan. The hourly payment rate is $13.16 for personal care aides, $15.20 for advanced personal care aide services, and $28.07 for nursing visits. The maximum payment is $2,368 a month, which is equal to the state's Medicaid cost for nursing home care. No more than one nursing visit a week can be authorized. Very few residents receive advanced personal care and nursing visits.
The state limits the room and board rate for Medicaid beneficiaries to the federal SSI payment plus the state supplement, also called a "cash grant," which varies depending on the type of facility. Type I facilities provide room and board, supervision, and protective oversight and receive a monthly payment of $695, comprising the SSI payment and a state supplement of $131. Type II facilities provide personal care, dietary supervision, and health care in addition to Type I services, and receive a combined monthly payment of $826, comprising the SSI payment and a state supplement of $262.
Montana uses a payment system that have elements of a tiered system but lack the structure and limited number of payment levels of tiered approaches. The payment amount varies widely based on the number and type of impairments, a structure more like a fee-for-service reimbursement approach. Montana's payment is based on a point system. Agency field staff determine the number of points based on an assessment of impairments, and the provider receives $33 a month per point. Residents with severe impairments, totally dependent in more than three ADLs, can receive $44 a month for each point.
Monthly waiver reimbursement rates for personal care facilities vary between $520 (the basic service rate) and $1,800, depending on the residents' level of care needs. Additional payments are calculated based on ADL and other impairments. The points determine the actual payment within the range. The state limits monthly room and board payments for Medicaid beneficiaries to $564. The total monthly amount facilities receive (for services, room and board) ranges from $1,084 to $2,363, although very few participants have been approved at the highest service rate.

Gemini
The Air element of Gemini brings communication, intellect and speed! This is one of the joy-of life signs, one that reaches out, expands and expresses. Ruler of Mercury. Gemini is an inquisitive student with a quick grasp of subjects. Mutable motivation brings adaptability. This is wonderful because variety-loving Gemini needs change. A flexible personality ensures that Gemini can connect with others. Gemini's active energy can go too far, and then Gemini has a hard time finding the right direction. Members of this sign needs a countervailing force of stability. The desire to communicate quickly and rapidly benefits when tempered by receptivity. Then not only can the Twins speak, they can listen in return -- and complete the circuit! Balance comes from slowing down, listening, and learning the fine art of follow-through!
The Positive Side of Gemini:
The person born under this sign of the Heavenly Twins is usually quite bright and quickwitted. Some of them are capable of doing many different things. The Gemini person very often has many different interest. He keeps an open mind and is always anxious to learn new things. The Geminian is often an analytical person. He is a person who enjoys making use of his intellect. He is governed more by his mind than by his emotions. He is a person who is not confined to one view; he can often understand both sides to a problem or question. He knows how to reason; how to make rapid decisions if need be. He is an adaptable person and can make himself at home almost anywhere. There are all kinds of situations he can adapt to. He is a person who seldom doubts himself; he is sure of his talents and his ability to think and reason. The Geminian is generally most satisfied when he is in a situation where he can make use of his intellect. Never short of imagination, he often has strong talents for invention. He is rather a modern person when it comes to life; the Geminian almost always moves along with the times-perhaps that is why he remains so youthful throughout most of his life. Literature and art appeal to the person born under this sign. Creativity in almost any form
will interest and intrigue the Gemini man or woman. The Geminian is often quite charming. A good talker, he often is the center of attraction at any gathering. People find it easy to like a person born under this sign because he can appear easygoing and usually has a good sense of humor.
The Negative Side of Gemini:
Sometimes the Gemini person tries to do too many things at one time-and as a result, winds up finishing nothing. Some Geminians are easily distracted and find it rather difficult to concentrate on one thing for too long a time. Sometimes they give in to trifling fancies and find it rather boring to become too serious about anything. Some of them are never dependable, no matter what they promise. Although the Gemini man or woman often appears to be well-versed on many subjects, this is sometimes just a veneer. His knowledge may be only superficial, but because he speaks so well he gives people the impression of erudition. Some Geminians are sharp-tongued and inconsiderate; they think only of themselves and their own pleasure.
Duality, which seeks to explore every option, and air, which blows things into every nook and cranny ? are very complimentary and have a lot in common. Combining dualism and air in a single sign makes Gemini the archetype dual sign. This sign is the least interested in making a decision or a commitment ? it wants to enjoy every possibility and explore every option. Gemini is like the air blowing every which way.

It analyzes and organises and defines the way we interact with others. Mercury in your chart reveals how you get your point across and in what style....
3rd House
The Third House is commonly referred to as the House of Communication. In this House, much of the communication is going on between the individual and those he or she holds close: brothers and sisters, as well as neighbors. While communication here can be both written and verbal, it also has a conscious quality to it. Think about kindred spirits and mental connections. This serves to highlight ...
Air
Those with too much emphasis on the air element have an over-active mind which must be guided and controlled. This is the sort of person that lives in his head and, if there is little earth or fire to motivate him to act on the ideas, he can become a dabbler in all sorts of curiosities without having much effect or developing much depth within himself. These people cant do anything without thinkin...

Gemini Tarot Card Symbols
These are some Tarot cards that are connected Gemini. It is interesting to note similarities between each card such as the objects and ideas pictured and the colors that are used. One aspect that is particular interesting about the Osho Tarot Deck is its use of color and interesting symbolic concepts.. These symbols give us understanding into underlying ideas and thought patterns that can be used for meditation. The Inner Guide Meditation connects astrology to the tarot with amazing practical meditation exercises to expand your awareness.
The Lovers
What we call love is really a whole spectrum of relating, reaching from the earth to the sky. At the most earthy level, love is sexual attraction. Many of us remain stuck there, because our conditioning has burdened our sexuality with all kinds of expectations and repressions. Actually the biggest ""problem"" with sexual love is that it never lasts. Only if we accept this fact can we then reall...
Magician
This naked figure sits on the lotus leaf of perfection, gazing at the beauty of the night sky. She knows that ""home"" is not a physical place in the outside world, but an inner quality of relaxation and acceptance. The stars, the rocks, the trees, the flowers, fish and birds--all are our brothers and sisters in this dance of life. We human beings tend to forget this, as we pursue our own priva...
8 of Swords
Guilt is one of the most destructive emotions in which we can get caught. If we have wronged another, or gone against our own truth, then of course we will feel bad. But to let ourselves be overwhelmed with guilt is to invite a migraine. We end up surrounded by nagging clouds of self-doubt and feelings of worthlessness to the point where we cannot see any of the beauty and joy that life is tryi...
9 of Swords
The image is of Ananda, the cousin and disciple of Gautam Buddha. He was at Buddha's side constantly, attending to his every need for forty-two years. When Buddha died, the story is told that Ananda was still at his side, weeping. The other disciples chastised him for his misunderstanding: Buddha had died absolutely fulfilled; he should be rejoicing. But Ananda said, "You misunderstand. I'm wee...
Queen of Pentacles
The Queen of Rainbows is like a fantastic plant that has reached the apex of its flowering and its colors. She is very sexual, very alive, and full of possibilities. She snaps her fingers to the music of love, and her zodiac necklace is placed in a way that Venus lies over her heart. The sleeves of her garment contain an abundance of seeds, and as the wind blows the seeds will be scattered to t...
Prince of Swords
The figure in this card is completely covered in armor. Only his glare of rage is visible, and the whites of the knuckles on his clenched fists. If you look closely at the armor, you can see it's covered with buttons, ready to detonate if anybody so much as brushes up against them. In the background we see the shadowy movie that plays in this man's mind--two figures fighting for a castle....
Gemini Animal Symbols

Click on the animal that connects to you the most to find out more about them.

Important Note About Signs, Symbols and Their Meanings
Signs and symbols cultivate their meanings according to culture, context, passage of time in society as well as mass societal opinion. What's cool and highly important is that signs and symbols earn their most powerful meanings from our own personal perspectives.
This website strives to provide you with the best, time-honored information when defining signs and symbols. However, in the final analysis, "Beauty (and symbolism) is in the eye of the beholder."
Having said that, it's in our best interest to invest the time to do personal research on symbolic events happing to us. This website is just one perspective in an ocean of variety and diversity in the realm of symbolism. So dive it! There is a whole universe of deeper meanings to explore! You can start your research by clicking on the links at the end or to the side of this page. Odds are good I've got a follow-up article about this symbolic topic. ;)
As always, thanks for your willingness to learn more about the language of symbolism. It's a language that is universal and everywhere. It's super-groovy to travel with you on your symbolic path, and maybe offer a little translation along the way. Thanks for reading and exploring!

Heat pumps are a smart choice when it comes to your home’s comfort. They can be more energy efficient than traditional heating and cooling systems and can bring your energy bills down.

Learn more about Heat Pumps.
Water Heaters
Arizona Comfort Systems is happy to offer our Hereford, AZ customers two options when it comes to water heaters.
Many people are familiar with the traditional water heater. It works by storing water in a tank and keeping it heated to a preset temperature.
Tankless water heaters are a new idea to many people. How does it work? As the name implies, there is no tank to store water. Instead, water is heated on an as-needed basis. A couple of the key benefits of a tankless water heater are that you are not heating water until it’s needed and you won’t run out of hot water.
Let the water heater professionals at Arizona Comfort Systems help you determine which type of water heater is best for your situation.
Learn more about Water Heaters.
Indoor Air Quality
Between work and home life, the average person spends about 90% of their time indoors! Indoor air can be 2 to 5 times more polluted than outside air. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency ranked indoor air quality as a top 5 environmental danger.
A well-insulated home can help with your energy bills by keeping a constant temperature, but that also leads to the same air being recycled through your home each time you run your air conditioner or furnace. Be sure you have proper filtration in place to prevent allergens and bacteria from circulating around your air.
Arizona Comfort Systems can help you breathe easy. Call us today at 520-459-5681 and we can put together a plan for your home!
Learn more about Indoor Air Quality.
Air Ducts
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Star program, leaky ducts in attics or crawlspaces can account for 20% or more of a home’s heating and cooling energy losses. This makes it difficult to keep your house comfortable and can result in higher utility bills. Some signs that you may have leaky ducts include:
High Summer and Winter utility bills
Rooms that are difficult to heat and cool
Stuffy rooms that never seem to feel comfortable
Ducts are located in an attic, crawlspace, or the garage
Tangled or kinked flexible ducts in your system
Learn more about how you can detect, prevent, and fix air duct issues with the help of the professionals at Arizona Comfort Systems. Find out more about duct testing, duct insulation, and duct cleaning and how they relate to and impact indoor air quality.
Contact us at 520-459-5681 or request air duct service online today.
Learn more about Air Ducts.
Humidifiers and Dehumidifiers
The comfort of your home not only depends on the air temperature but also the amount of moisture in the air.
Cold weather typically means dry, uncomfortable air. Dry air can cause respiratory problems as well as damage wooden furniture. Whole home humidifiers emit water vapor to increase the humidity in your home.
On the other hand, hot weather can mean thick, humid air. This can lead to condensation on your windows, mold spots on walls or ceilings, blistering paint or peeling wallpaper, just to list a few issues. A whole home dehumidifier removes excess moisture from the air in your home.
Humidifiers can improve your indoor air quality as well as positively impact the overall health of your family and health of your home. Controlling the humidity in your home will help protect not only your respiratory system but also your wood floors, furniture and artwork.
Let the professionals at Arizona Comfort Systems help you decide what’s best for your home! Call us at 520-459-5681 or request service online today.

The Solar Impulse Foundation and New Energy Nexus join forces to scale cleantech businesses
New Energy Nexus launched the Speedwell Entrepreneurs’ Call-To-Action months ago and gathered 399 signatures of cleantech companies. Today, it is handing them to the Solar Impulse Foundation and its 1000 solutions challenge to take the initiative further and help scale these businesses.
“Thirty years ago, we had a chance to save the planet”. This powerful and tragic statement was made by Nathaniel Rich in a brilliant piece published this summer in The New York Times: Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change. How frustrating to think that we could have done something to stop the deadly path we’re on… But we didn’t.
At the Solar Impulse Foundation, we believe that today, we are once again at a moment in history where we can, and must act. Since the 90’s, scientific progress has allowed us to invent clean technologies, processes, products and services. Entrepreneurs have built cleantech companies all around the world that could help us drastically reduce our CO2 emissions, if scaled now. The more we help these companies to grow, the faster we can transition to clean energy. So, what are waiting for?
In 2015, at the UN climate talks held in Paris, WWF Climate solver issued an Entrepreneurs Call to Action Statement. This declaration “urged world leaders to increase their climate action efforts and invest in climate and energy entrepreneurs and solutions.” It was signed by 121 clean energy companies from 25 countries.
Following this initiative, New Energy Nexus launched a few months ago the Speedwell Entrepreneurs Call To Action urging even more entrepreneurs, incubator managers, and organizers of startup ecosystems to sign onto their call. The declaration stated: “We are some of the thousands of cleantech business women and men, founders and starters, workers and builders, commonly known as entrepreneurs, from all corners of the world that have the solutions ready to help our customers to lower their cost, achieve better performance and improve their lives without the need of harmful fossil fuel emissions” (read the full statement here). The Statement has been signed by 399 startups and organizations from 55 countries and will be presented on the world stage at GCAS, on September 13th.
These two statements, in 2015 and 2018, have made the voices of entrepreneurs heard and prove that there are countless startups willing to stand for climate action. Now New Energy Nexus is handing over this action to the Solar Impulse Foundation with our 1000 Solutions Challenge. We are calling all the entrepreneurs who have signed this Call-To-Action to join our World Alliance for Efficient Solutions and be part of the 1000 Solutions to make sure that their voices continue to be heard and that entrepreneurs stay at the forefront of this mouvement. By bringing them to decision-makers in governments, institutions and business leaders around the world, we’ll show that there are efficient solutions, they are profitable and it’s time to implement them.
“We’re handing over the Speedwell Entrepreneurs’ Call-to-Action to the Solar Impulse Foundation to carry on the torch and take it forward to the COP24 in Poland and beyond to ensure that the entrepreneurs’ voice is part of the conversation around climate solutions” stated Danny Kennedy, Co-founder and President of New Energy Nexus.
“There are solutions everywhere, but people do not know them. So it is important to have partners with whom we identify more and more solutions and we have experts to identify which are the best solutions. With Nexus I think there is a fantastic possibility of increasing the network, going faster into identifying the solutions and assessing them.” stated Bertrand Piccard, founder of the Solar Impulse Foundation.
Along with New Energy Nexus’ goal of replicating the California cleantech model in other countries to accelerate 100’000 startups in cleantech by 2030, we all aim to scale clean, efficient and profitable solutions. If we don’t, we might once again miss our chance to “save the planet”. Through this collaboration, we will work together to make sure entrepreneurs’ solutions are known to those who need them, such as governments and businesses with ambitious targets, and that these entrepreneurs benefit from New Energy Nexus’ know-how in supporting and funding cleantech startups around the world.

I want to be the hope for somebody else
At just 9 years old, J'son has undergone 10 surgeries, including brain surgery, and receives monthly blood transfusions at the hospital. He's been fighting sickle cell anemia-and the bouts of severe pain and fatigue caused by this life-threatening blood disorder-since he was born.
J'son needs a marrow transplant for a chance at a cure, but sadly his twin sister, Ja'Kerria, is not a match. In fact, most patients who need a transplant do not have a match in their family. They depend on the Be The Match Registry® to find a matching donor.
J'son's African American heritage makes his search for a match even more challenging. Patients are most likely to match someone of their own race or ethnicity, but African American patients have the lowest chances of finding a matching donor. That's why more African American registry members are needed now.
"Please join; you could help save someone," says Shalonda, J'son's mom. "It might not be J'son, but you could be the cure for someone else."

When you're asked to donate
Not everyone on the Be The Match Registry® will match and be asked to donate to a patient. In fact, the chances of donating are about 1 in 430. If you are asked to donate, the patient's doctor has chosen you as the best donor.
Becoming a bone marrow donor is an important commitment. If you are asked to be a donor for a patient, you will receive all the information needed to make this decision. We encourage you to discuss your decision to donate with your family and friends. They can help support you through the process.
How much time will the donation process take?
Donor experiences
Actual donors and donor medical staff share their bone marrow donation experience. Watch now.
The typical time commitment for the donation process is 20-30 hours of your time spread out over a four-to-six-week period. This does not include travel time, which is defined by air travel and staying overnight in a hotel. Nearly 40% of donors will travel during the donation process. Learn more about the steps leading to donation.
Two donation methods: Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and marrow
If you agree to donate, the patient's doctor will request that you donate either peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or marrow. The doctor chooses the donation method that is best for the patient.
If you are asked to donate, call the telephone number that is in the email or letter you received. If you don't have this number, please call 1 (800) MARROW-2.

Bustos Helps Introduce H.R. 1, the For the People Act to Clean Up Corruption in Washington
WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos (IL-17) helped introduce H.R. 1 – the For the People Act of 2019. This legislation would take numerous steps to clean up corruption in Washington and make Congress more accountable to the people – strengthening ethics laws, reforming big money in our elections and making it easier for citizens to vote.
“In every corner of our District, I hear from families who feel either drowned out or left behind in our democracy – and with big money and special interests all too often calling the shots, they’re absolutely right that we must level the playing field for folks across the country,” Congresswoman Bustos said. “Last year, I helped put together a concrete set of proposals to bring more transparency to Congress and to give a voice to citizens in our democratic process – and that’s why I’m proud that much of our work has been incorporated into the For the People Act. This bill is a sorely needed first step to bring more accountability to Congress and clean up the mess in Washington – because for our country to succeed, the voices of ordinary Americans cannot be ignored while the greedy special interests feed at the trough.”
Last year, as Co-Chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, Congresswoman Bustos and Democratic Leadership unveiled “A Better Deal for our Democracy” to fix Washington’s broken political system. Building on that work, the For the People Act will:
MAKE IT EASIER TO VOTE. The For the People Act implements automatic voter registration, making available early voting and vote by mail, and strengthening our voting system by committing to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.
TAKE ON BIG MONEY IN POLITICS. The For the People Act requires all political organizations to disclose and make public large donations and updates political advertising laws to modernize with new digital technology.
STRENGTHEN ETHICS LAWS AND HOLD CONGRESS ACCOUNTABLE. The For the People Act establishes a code of conduct and ethics for the Supreme Court and also closes loopholes that allow former Members of Congress to lobby without complying with the required cooling-off period – which will help break the revolving door between industry and the federal government.

CHINESE NEW YEAR- Celebrations in Chiang Mai
CHINESE NEW YEAR - Celebrations in Chiang Mai
Sno-Thai trade and cultural ties span the centuries. In times past, seafarers, marine merchants and traders sailed up the kingdom's rivers with vessels laden with merchandise and precious goods including
Chinese tea, silk, and fine porcelain. As trade between the two countries flourished, permanent settlements of people of various ethnic Chinese origins were soon established.
While the early settlers quickly adapted to their new way of life and adopted Thai ways, they also continued to maintain strong cultural ties and practiced the customs and traditions diligently observed by their forefathers. Of these, the Chinese New Year remains the most important of annual festivals on the Chinese lunar calendar observed in the various regions of Thailand. This year, it falls on February 16th, but celebrations begin earlier than that (and end a little bit later too).
As in all Chinese communities around the world, Chinese communities in Thailand or communities with residents of Chinese ancestry celebrate this event with a big bang. Local rites and festivities around the country have acquired a definitive Thai-Chinese flavor, but the traditional Chinese features remain. Chinese New Year Celebrations will be held in Chiang Mai' Chinatown as well as in twelve major provinces in Thailand where the Thai-Chinese community is significant, the most famous cities being Bangkok (Yaowarat), Ayutthaya, Ratchaburi and Suphanburi in central Thailand, Chonburi on the Eastern Seaboard, Phuket and Songkhla in the South, Nakhon Ratchassima in the Northeast.
HOW IS THE CHINESE NEW YEAR CELEBRATED?
Unlike our New Year festivities which always take place at midnight between December 31st and January 1st, the Chinese version is a movable celebration, based on the lunar calendar. Chinese New Year, also called Lunar New Year or the Chinese Spring Festival, holds the most significant position among all Chinese festivals and holidays. It lasts for the first fifteen days of the Chinese lunar calendar, which on the western calendar
begins sometime between January 21 and February 21, varying from year to year. This lunar new year recognizes an animal from the zodiac system, this year we are getting into the year of the dog, which will start on February the 16th. Celebrations include decorations, parades, folk traditions and a wonderful feast.
The global celebrations of the Chinese New Year are an explosion of light and sound - involving bell ringing, lighting firecrackers and watching traditional lion dances. Traditionally, the festival is a time to honor ancestors and get together with all members of the family. The celebration itself has three different purposes: to celebrate the year you are leaving, to gather with family and to ring in good luck for the upcoming year. There are a few steps which are very important to this festival: a few days before new year’s eve, Chinese housewives will clean their houses to sweep away bad fortune, they will also buy and prepare many dishes for the coming celebrations as well as for the worship of the ancestors. On new year’s eve, families gather together for a reunion dinner, traditionally, children will receive red envelopes with “lucky money” inside and positive wishes written for the new year.
Through out the festival offerings will be done to honor ancestors. These offerings range from burning bank notes, praying to deities, burning incense, lighting candles and much more. The main color of the festival is red: it symbolizes a color of fire being used along with drums and firecrackers.
Top Lucky Food and Symbolisms:
During the Chinese New Year Festival, certain dishes will be prepared in every house, each dish has a very symbolic meaning. The auspicious symbolism of these foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance.
- Chinese Dumplings: with a history of more than 1,800 years, dumplings are a classic Chinese food, and a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year’s Eve.
- Glutinous Rice Cakes: in Chinese, glutinous rice cakes sounds like it means “getting higher year-on-year”. They are made with sticky rice, sugar, chestnuts, Chinese dates and lotus leaves.
- Sweet Rice Balls: the pronunciation and round shape of the sweet rice balls are associated with reunion and being together.
- Longevity Noodles: they are a symbol of wish for longevity. Their length and unsevered preparation are also symbolic of the eater’s life.
- Fish: in Chinese, “fish” sounds like “plenty”. Fish symbolises abundance and prosperity.
- Chicken: it has two meanings: one is career progress as the cockscomb resembles a Chinese mandarin’s hat; the other is punctuality and diligence as the cock wakes up and crows early in the morning.
- Pork: it symbolises prosperity, abundance and well-being.
- Duck: it signifies the ability to carry out many tasks.
- Good Fortune Fruits: certain fruits are eaten during the
Chinese New Year period, such as tangerines and oranges. They are selected as they are particularly round and “golden” in colour, symbolizing fullness and wealth, but more obviously for the lucky sound they bring when spoken. Apples symbolise peace and good health. Bananas grow in bunches, signifying a large family with many children.
- Sweets: sweet desserts are served to bring sweetness in the coming new year.
WHAT DOES THE YEAR OF THE DOG MEANS ASTROLOGICALLY?
We all know that dogs, as our best animal friends, are loyal, friendly, and kind. People born under the sign of the dog are said to share those traits. They are honest, easygoing, and helpful to others. They are less likely to seek money and power and are more likely to try and make the world a better place. On the other hand, they may be critical, stubborn, and cold at times. Dogs can have difficulty communicating and may fall into pessimism when they feel doubt, but if they can live a good, quiet life, they will have a positive outlook. These personality traits also vary based on the lunar month of the year in which dogs are born, too.
Some fellow Earth Dogs include Madonna and Michael Jackson. Other people born under the sign of the dog in nonearth element years include Steven Spielberg, Justin Bieber, Winston Churchill, Elvis Presley, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Mother Teresa among others. Dogs’ lucky numbers are 3, 4, and 9, and unlucky numbers are 1, 6, and 7. Lucky colours are red, green, and purple, while blue, white, and gold are unlucky. Dogs are said to be romantically compatible with people born under the sign of the rabbit, but not with those born under the dragon, goat, or rooster.
Not only does the year play a part in the destiny of a person born with the dog as their sign, but the time and date are also factors. Those born between 9 AM and 1 PM, as well as those born between 3 PM and 5 PM are said to be the most likely to achieve success. Those born on the 1st, 6th, 7th, 17th, 21th, 24th, 26th, 28th or the 30th day of the month in the Chinese lunar calendar are said to be the luckiest.
CHINESE NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS IN CHIANG MAI.
As each year, Chiang Mai's Chinese New Year Festival celebrations are planned at Warorot Market and promise to delight all ages. Chinese
customs are numerous and they will bring a colourful sense of renewal to this period of the year. Visit the city's Lao Chow Alley, the local China Town, located at Warorot market. For this occasion, the street along Ping river will be closed to cars and motorbikes, allowing pedestrians to walk and have fun. It will be the centre of Chinese New Year Celebrations in town with the street along Ping river being closed at night during two days for the celebration (February 16th & 17th). Home and shops along Warorot market main road will be decorated with red lanterns in honor of the event. You will also enjoy spectacular processions of dragon and lion dances, Chinese cultural show and musical performance. The neighbourhood houses two famous Chinese temples: the most famous temple being located along Ping river, passing the flower shops; and the second temple at the back of Warorot market.
Another famous place to celebrate at night will be Thapae Place, housing every evening cultural shows, dances and beauty pageants.
Be prepared to work your way through the hectic crowds and wear red to be part of the party. It will certainly be the place to be in Chiang Mai.

General comments about using the templates and guides
The HSQF is a more generic set of Standards designed to apply to a range of service types, and is worded in terms of Expected Outcomes, Context and Indicators. It does not prescribe specific policies. In order to be compliant, organisations need to demonstrate that they have guiding documents (policies, procedures, plans, etc) records, staff awareness and client understanding around each of the indicators.
We offer a standard set of templates, which respond to the Indicators, but it is not intended to be exhaustive. Depending upon how your organisation works, some policies may make more sense if they are combined into one. Other areas may be complex and more manageable if divided into several separate policies. In these instances, you can still use the guides to check that you have everything covered.

This article is part of a Daily Caller series on the future of whaling. Click here to read “Japan’s phony, wasteful whale research must end,” by Greenpeace’s Phil Kline.
There are few activities more pleasurable than whaling. Like chess, the task of hunting giant, seafaring beasts engages all of a man’s wits. But unlike chess, whaling brings man deep into nature, far from the distractions of civilization. That combination is unique — no other sport matches it. That’s why I have never felt more alive, more human, than when I’m whaling.
It’s also an extremely charming pastime. Part of whaling’s charm lies in its romance. Sailing, of course, lends itself to romance, but the natural romance of sailing is heightened by the adventure inherent in whaling. The result is a peculiarly inspiring type of romance. It’s no coincidence that Moby Dick, one of the greatest books ever written, is about whaling. In fact, as a writer myself, I often go on whaling expeditions in order to spur my imagination.
Part of whaling’s charm lies in the patriotism it evokes. Indeed, the sport is thoroughly American. Whaling was popular in colonial America; at the time of the Revolution, there were more than 300 whaling boats in Massachusetts alone. The size of the American whaling fleet grew from there. Before long, America was a whaling powerhouse. Yankee whalers helped explore the world’s oceans and discover previously unexplored land masses. They are some of the heroes of American history. To reject whaling is to reject their legacy — and America.
The best part of whaling is the hunt. But one of the biggest pleasures of whaling comes after a whale has been harpooned, killed and cooked. Which is to say, whales are remarkably delicious. True, whale meat is high in fat — it isn’t the sort of food you’d want to eat for dinner every night — but it’s great for special occasions.
Whaling is also great for the economy. During its peak in the mid-nineteenth century, the U.S. whaling industry employed tens of thousands of Americans. Now, of course, it employs very few. Not only would legalizing whaling create jobs, it would spark the revitalization of America’s whaling centers, like New Bedford, Mass., while lowering the price of the whale oil we use to light our lanterns.
Why, then, do environmental groups and others oppose whaling? It’s simple: racism. Whaling has historically played a central role in many Native American societies. Tribes like the Makah have whaled for centuries and want to continue to do so today. But the anti-whaling bigots will have none of it.
It’s also possible that anti-whaling activists are Confederate sympathizers who are upset about the Union’s employment of whaling ships during the Civil War.
Ultimately, God commands us to hunt whales. The New Testament is very clear that humans are superior to beasts. Consider this passage from the Gospel of Matthew:
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns. And yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you? [Matthew 6:26-30]
Whales think they’re so great. They think they can roam the world’s oceans unmolested. And for the most part, they’re right: Since 1986, whaling has been banned by the International Whaling Convention, which was created in 1946 to oversee the sport. It’s time for the madness to end. It’s time to legalize whaling.

The Writing on the…Wall: What is Mitch McConnell Thinking?
If, heaven forfend, I were Mitch McConnell, here’s what I’d be thinking…
I know:
the Democrats will likely keep the house and
take the senate in 2020
Trump’s election in 2016 was a historic fluke unlikely to be repeated. Lightning will not strike the same place twice.
From this it follows that the only way to maintain a grip on power is to hold the presidency.
What else do I know?
Trump and the GOP won’t be able to get anything done in the next two years
The economy will probably tip into recession some time during the 2020 campaign
The Mueller investigation will likely conclude within the next few months
It is probably going to be damning
The House is probably going to impeach
The start of the 2020 presidential campaign will unfold against the background of impeachment proceedings, and my senators battling to be re-elected will be facing the headwind of an unpopular president besieged by impeachment and implicated in potentially criminal wrongdoing
We’ve gotten what we wanted from Trump: deregulation, tax cuts, judges. By rights, we shouldn’t even be in power—it’s a miracle we got this far. Time to cut our losses, board the lifeboats, and paddle out to safety before the ship goes down; but first, help set the charges to blow it up and hasten its sinking…
Privately, my colleagues and I know full well that Trump is not only totally unfit for the job, but probably sort of insane. With the departure of Mattis, we are now genuinely alarmed at what he might do, and how that might damage the party in the long term.
Regarding the shutdown, I can see the writing on the Wall. Trump won’t budge on the Wall, since it’s all he really has left at this point. The GOP has lost the messaging war on this, and Trump owns the shutdown. But we can be part of the solution.
When Pelosi and the House pass the bill to reopen the government, make Trump an offer: “We will pass the bill with 51 votes; if you veto it, we’ll come back with 67 votes to override the veto.” The latter would be humiliating for Trump, a body blow to his authority, potentially crippling to his approval rating, which has sunk to Charlottesville lows. It would seem to be an offer he can’t refuse.
But he will. He is constitutionally (!) incapable of compromising and giving in on a core promise to his base and a foundation stone of his political brand and identity. He would take a veto override on the chin and go out on the trail to rail against the swamp.
At this point, I face a critical juncture: Continue to enable Trump and allow him to further take over the party, or find a way to force him out? Remember that he is an outsider, an interloper—he is just passing through. I need to think about the long term.
I quietly begin a series of secret meetings with the Democratic leadership to negotiate an impeachment cooperation strategy. I need 20 GOP senators to convict—that’s all I need—preferably one’s not up for reelection in 2020, and not from Trump country. They are the sacrifice that must be made, the ones who have to fall on the sword.
Moreover, there is a strategic benefit here: the Democratic candidates are all planning to—itching to—run against Trump. If he’s gone, they’ll be flat-footed. Remove him before the campaign picks up steam, and you change the game. Kasich, Corker, Flake, and who knows who else will throw in and challenge Pence, blame the recession on Trump’s trade wars, and promise to heal the country in a way that the rabid socialist Democrats cannot. They offer a middle ground between Trumpism and socialism.
This is the only way to save what face we can and the only hope for holding onto a slice of power in the middle term.
I try to smile, even though my smile creeps even me out, and it is only ever just a try.

15 Reasons why Joe Scarborough will run for president in 2020–and win.
Like many political junkies, I usually start my day with Morning Joe. Over the last few months, I’ve become convinced that not only is Scarborough going to run for president, but that he already is, that he should, and that he would probably win. Handily.
Of course, at one level we live in the world of the permanent campaign, and the race has already begun. Hard as it is to believe–so powerful was the shock of Trump’s election that, for most of the country, it has still not fully worn off–the 2020 campaign will commence shortly after the midterms. I predict that some time in early 2019, Scarborough will declare his candidacy on air and suspend the show.
Don’t take it from me. CNN’s Chris Cillizza last summer: “If you wanted to run for president in 2020, you’d be doing exactly what Joe Scarborough is doing right now.”

Fake Sense
There are five problems with the Biblical justification of the family separation law policy.
First, Romans 13 is taken out of context and is cherry picking—plenty of Biblical support could be amassed for justifying opposition to unjust laws.
Second, Romans 13 has, historically, been invoked by Loyalists advocating, well, loyalty, to the crown during the American Revolution, and, more disturbingly, by supporters of slavery prior to the Civil War. And as is well known, Paul supported the institution of slavery.
Third, even if there were clear and unambiguous Biblical support for such a policy, that is not a legitimate justification for any federal law or policy due to the first amendment. We live in a constitutional republic and a pluralistic democratic society, not a theocracy. It may be a nation of Christians, but it is not a Christian nation.
Fourth, this justification ignores the difference between morality and legality. Just because something is legal does not mean it is moral. This has always been an aspect of Judeo-Christian morality and politics, from Moses’ slave revolt against the Egyptians to Christian opposition to infanticide under the Romans to King fighting segregation in America.
Fifth, even disregarding the first amendment, on balance the teachings of Jesus would almost certainly be opposed to such a policy. The entire thrust of Christian morality tends toward a concern for the poor, the child, the stranger, the disenfranchised, toward mercy and compassion for “the least of these.”
***
Beyond the Biblical justification, there are problems with the administration’s rhetoric surrounding the policy, as well as its approach to immigration in general.
First, the administration is not “enforcing the law.” This is not a statute. It is a matter of discretionary policy, one the administration chose to enforce.
Second, this is not a problem created by the Democrats. Trump has employed this strategy before, e.g., claiming that the Democrats created the DACA problem. That’s another lie. But even worse, it’s really an attempt to extort broader concessions on immigration policy, as I’ll explain below.
Third, this is not a “crisis” in which the president’s hand has been forced. The administration has deliberately inflated the immigration problem more broadly. The facts are these: Immigration across the southern border has declined precipitously in recent years, in large part because the Mexican economy has improved, its birth rate has declined, and deportations spiked significantly—under the Obama administration.
Fourth, increasing legal immigration, and providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, is good economic and social policy. First, it is not true, as Trump and co. often claim, that immigrants are a threat to public safety. The fact is that such people are less likely, on average, to commit violent crimes. Second, immigration is good for economic growth, which is a function of two things: population growth and productivity growth. The US birth rate has declined, so the only way to hit the 3% or 4% growth targets Trump and co. desire is to boost immigration. Third, social security has recently started drawing from its trust fund, and in the middle future there will not be enough payroll tax revenue to fund benefits, making the system insolvent. Increased immigration means more young, productive people paying into the system.
Fifth, the administration is pretty obviously using this policy to extort concessions on immigration in order to be able to campaign on it in 2018 and 2020. In other words, this is all about The Wall. The Wall—a solution we can’t afford to a problem that doesn’t exist—is, of course, not about the Wall—it’s about Trump getting re-elected.
Sixth, there is a long history of conservative politicians cloaking appeals to resentful white voters under the mantle of “public safety,” “national security, “sovereignty,” “law and order,” and the like: Goldwater’s opposition to desegregation by appealing to states’ rights, Nixon’s southern strategy promising to restore “law and order,” etc. Trump doesn’t even bother with the ruse—he openly admitted that the invocation of an obscure national security law to justify the tariffs against our allies was in bad faith.
***
All of which is to say that the first mistake–made by proponents–is to try to defend the policy on its merits, and the second–made by opponents–is to object to the policy because it doesn’t make sense. These aren’t really “policies”—they’re political strategies. Nearly none of the administrations policies make sense—from trade to taxes to energy to climate to Iran to spitting in the face of our allies to the gutting of the State Department to praising authoritarian rulers to healthcare to immigration—because they’re not concerned with solving problems, but with creating them.
The Trump administration does not make sense. They fake sense.
They do not assess the factual lay of the land and decide on how best to solve problems; they assess what their voting and donor bases believe to be problems—and what will best distract, divide, and confuse the public–and then fixate on and inflate those faux problems. The most important, long-term structural problems—reducing income inequality, funding a new infrastructure plan, combating climate change, and building a globally competitive American renewable energy economy—are neglected.
Finally, the policy is needless, and needlessly cruel, and in this way it is vintage Trump. While the Bible is an inappropriate legal foundation, its invocation in this debate is actually crucially important, because it can shed light on just how heinous, inhumane, and morally retarded Trump is as a person and as a president. What irony that the
party that claims to be so animated by family values has thrown its lot in with a twice-divorced man, a serial adulterer with porn stars and Playmates, and a bully who relishes inflicting pain on powerless people seeking asylum by separating families.
***
What we need, of course, is not a physical wall, but a moral one. Trump can rip up trade deals, flout democratic norms, cancel regulations, and perhaps even obstruct justice and collude with a foreign power to sabotage our electoral process. But the most important long-term damage he is doing is to undermine our respect for the differences between true and false and right and wrong.

Comfortably Numb: Human Rights and South America, Part VI
[Over the next week, I am posting a piece at at time of an essay I wrote reflecting on my trip to South America this summer. This is the final installment.]
VI. Study Near
Last summer, America celebrated the 200th birthday of Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau did not study abroad. Somewhat like Kant, he spent most of his life confined to a small territory. He went to Harvard, just a few miles down the road from his home in Concord, Mass. But in a way, Thoreau did study abroad; he just didn’t go very far. Thoreau’s study abroad was a mere two miles from his hometown: a modest wooden cabin he built in the woods by Walden Pond. Though he didn’t go far, he stayed a long time: two years. While commonly regarded as a founding father of American environmentalism, Thoreau was also a passionate advocate for what we today would call social justice. His time at Walden changed his perspective on Concord. Living on the fringes of town, he saw first-hand evidence of the marginalization of Concord’s vulnerable residents, including Irish immigrants and Native Americans. And, of course, he made a sustained case for civil disobedience a few years later. It may be a stretch, but perhaps Thoreau intuited what Pope Francis would confidently declare a century and a half later: that environmental and social justice go hand in hand. His time in the near abroad revealed the imperfections of the near.
We have little trouble finding the familiar in the foreign. We are terrible at finding the foreign in the familiar. If travel is not at least a little bit scary and hard and humbling, it’s not travel. It’s tourism. The challenge is not making sense of the new place. It’s not being a tourist at home. This was Thoreau’s signature talent—to daily encounter his tiny territory as an exotic land rich with mystery, never fully known. Travel, rightly done, can teach us how to inhabit our homeland with reverence and awe.
If I were speaking with a student coming back from study abroad, I would ask them some of the following questions: Not where did they go, but why? Not what did you get out of it, but how did it get to you? Who got to you? What stories struck you? What demands do they make on your own? On your country’s?
Ultimately, I suspect that human rights draw their power not from logical arguments, abstract moral principles, or international agreements—important though these are–but from the experiences of recognition, the memories that ravel about them, and the stories we spin from their ragged thread.

Comfortably Numb: Human Rights and South America, Part V
[Over the next week, I am posting a piece at at time of an essay I wrote reflecting on my trip to South America this summer. This is the second installment.]
V. The “BC Bubble” and the Hero’s Journey
If there is a moral ideal as hallowed in the Western tradition as human rights, it would be the Christian ideal of neighborly love. We tend to interpret this as, at least, not hurting people and not taking their stuff, and at most, being nice. We typically take the first part as the easy one. Of course we love ourselves! The challenge, we assume, is loving others. But as is usual with Jesus, things are not what they seem, and true wisdom is the opposite of conventional wisdom. The real challenge is loving ourselves, which is only possible through seeing ourselves as we truly are—as vulnerable, suffering, dependent, flawed, mortal, human. We tend to regard our “humanity” in abstract, or perhaps even biological, terms—as a class or species we belong to. But our recognition of our own humanity is actually an intimate affair, something spied far from the madding crowd.
Pope Francis expressed his understanding of this deep truth in his response to the question, “Who is Jorge Bergoglio?” His reply: “I am a sinner.” We tend to put saints and popes and heroes on pedestals, but they’re all flawed, too. In his study of the Argentinian dictatorship, The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War, Federico Finchelstein writes,
In contrast with many other Latin American countries, the Catholic Church was one of the main backers of the junta [in Argentina]…. The basis for this alliance rested on a notion accepted by most Argentine bishops at the time: any condemnation of human rights violations was a threat to the homeland and God…. The intimacy between God and the military nation was emphasized at the time, and Pope Franics, who as Father Bergoglio was the most important Jesuit in the country, never spoke out against this.
Even the best of us are in constant danger of the primordial avoidance. Our egos block us both from a genuine encounter with the neighbor, and a genuine encounter with ourselves. When we pile on additional layers of culture, nationality, religion, class, etc., the wall thickens even more. What maintains superficial bonds with the few undermines deeper bonds with the many.
At Boston College, it is customary to refer to the “BC bubble.” Apparently, the bubble is now portable: I hear students, faculty, and administrators report that for many of the popular study abroad destinations, such as Spain, BC students tend to clump together and, on weekends, skip around to other cities, bringing, in effect, the comforting connections of home abroad. While it is natural to want to maintain connections to the familiar, we should ask what is lost by bringing too many buffers, too many life-preservers, too much of the familiar to cling to that it saps the power of the adventure.
The mythologist Joseph Campbell liked to talk about what he called the “Hero’s Journey.” He believed that at the heart of all great stories—myths, epics, fairy tales, fictions—was a universal pattern. This basic archetype, the “monomyth,” has a threefold structure: 1) departure, 2) initiation, 3) return. Departure is the call to adventure, where the hero is drawn or casts herself into the unknown, a dark underworld, a zone of great power and great danger. There she encounters challenges that evoke qualities of her character and unlock parts of herself she didn’t even know were there. The descent is disorienting, and she must resist the temptation to retreat back to the light-world of the surface. But if she persists, she meets a great trial that, if survived and completed, initiates her into a new order, gives her deep insight, new eyes, a fresh perspective on herself and where she came from. Only from the bottom of the ocean can she finally see the surface. This hard-won pearl in hand, she returns home, sharing her wisdom with the community. Without that plunge into the unfamiliar, she would not have really gone anywhere. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. As Campbell liked to say, “If you’re falling, dive.”

Comfortably Numb: Human Rights and South America, Part IV
[Over the next week, I am posting a piece at at time of an essay I wrote reflecting on my trip to South America this summer. This is the fourth installment.]
IV. Human Rights in the Classroom
There is a kind of eternal frustration bound up with teaching ethics. In Plato’s dialogue, Meno, Socrates asks whether virtue can be taught (short answer: No.). In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle insists that the purpose of the inquiry is not to learn what virtue is, but to become good. The moral virtues cannot be transmitted through instruction, but must be acquired through habituation. Teaching ethics in a university classroom might then appear as a fool’s errand. The challenge is to puncture the air of unreality that pervades an academic setting, to help students see how and why these matters—of virtue and vice, of justice and injustice, of human rights—matter, and are bound up with their own lives. The assumption is that that same air of unreality pervades our everyday lives, and that regular puncturing can make us more awake and aware and responsive to reality. The goal, in short, is to make it real.

Comfortably Numb: Human Rights and South America, Part III
[Over the next week, I am posting a piece at at time of an essay I wrote reflecting on my trip to South America this summer. This is the third installment.]
III. Them—Us–I
The most powerful part of the faculty seminar, for me, was our visit to Villa Grimaldi, a sprawling estate on the outskirts of the city, tucked into the lap of the Andes, that had been converted into a detention and torture facility immediately after the military coup. Our tour guide, Pedro–a tall, poised man with observant, piercing blue eyes—was not only highly knowledgeable, but a great storyteller. About 20 minutes into the tour, when we first came to the torture chambers, his diction shifted: “And this is where we spent most mornings.” His use of the second person pronoun continued for the next several minutes. I traded glances with some of my colleagues, knowing we were thinking the same thing: “Is he using that language for effect, or was he actually a prisoner here?”
Our suspicions were confirmed several tour stops later, when Pedro began to tell his story. How he’d been taken. How he’d been imprisoned and tortured. How he’d been moved from one facility to another, spending a full 16 months in the regime’s detention system. How he’d been released, yet stuck in a zombie-like stupor for a long time afterward. How he’d learned, years later, that the reason the regime released people in such a condition was to strike fear into the population. And how, finally, he had come to the US, expressing his gratitude to the late Senator Ted Kennedy for his fierce opposition to human rights violations in Chile.
One of the most striking things about Pedro’s story was the ambivalence he felt toward the United States. On the one hand, the CIA helped foment the coup that led to his imprisonment and torture. On the other, Ted Kennedy’s valiant efforts enabled him to come to the US and put his life back together. America provided the kindling for the fire that burned him, and helped him heal from those very wounds. This ambivalence reflects a tension in America’s self-identity: as nationalistic, self-aggrandizing empire, or as cosmopolitan champion of human rights. Or perhaps the reality is more complicated: the attempt to beat back left wing politics in Latin America through covert support of rightwing dictatorships could be seen as part of the geopolitical struggle against communism, a threat to human rights. In any case, Pedro’s story complicated any simple picture of my country’s relation to his.
But what was most striking was not just his story, but how we told it. There was no theoretical discussion about human rights, no political theory or policy analysis, no history lesson. There was only a singular story of suffering, relayed from one person to another. And the many stories of suffering he told us. Stories of kidnap, torture, murder, rape.
And this.
One of the cruelest methods of the Chilean and Argentinian dictatorships was “disappearing” prisoners, which chiefly meant drugging them, throwing them onto a plane, and dumping them in the Pacific ocean. For a long time, however, many doubted this actually happened, racking it up to a rumor meant to demonize the dictatorship. Reports that the disappeared had had heavy objects, such as large rocks and pieces of metal from railroads, tied to their backs to sink their bodies began to trickle out from survivors of the detention camps. These reports were hauntingly confirmed when officials began to dredge the ocean floor miles from shore. While flesh, bone, and clothing were all worn and washed away, the only sign of human life left behind was a single button, encrusted in the rock.

Comfortably Numb: Human Rights and South America, Part II
[Over the next week, I am posting a piece at at time of an essay I wrote reflecting on my trip to South America this summer. This is the second installment.]
II. The Age of Neo-Illiberalism
Preparing to leave for a day of museums and tours recounting the atrocities of Chile’s military dictatorship under Pinochet, a headline from that morning’s New York Times caught my eye: “To Trump, Human Rights Concerns are Often a Barrier to Trade.”
Nowadays, it is hard not to hear the phrase “human rights” as hollow. Abroad and at home, the specter of illiberalism has descended. According to political scientist Larry Diamond, the world has been in a “democratic recession” since 2006. From Turkey to Russia, from the Philippines to the Netherlands, from France to the UK and, of course, the United States, the forces of populism, nationalism, and authoritarianism are, for the first time in seven decades, challenging the liberal international order. As Robin Niblett writes in a recent article in Foreign Affairs,
the architects of the [liberal international order] sought to promote not just economic development and individual fulfillment but also world peace. The best hope for that, they contended, lay in free markets, individual rights, rule of law, and elected governments, which would be checked by independent judiciaries, free presses, and vibrant societies.
We are playing at trading the “West”—the post-World War II liberal system erected by the Allies to foster economic interdependence in order to prevent civilizational war, protect human rights, and foster prosperity–for “Westeros”—the fictional world of Game of Thrones, a Hobbesian state of nature riven by warring families and fiefdoms, tribes and warlords, where force and fraud are the cardinal virtues.
According to this worldview, human rights are a luxury we cannot afford to care about. We must look out for #1. America first, humanity second.
Call it the age of “neo-illiberalism.”
Whether this phenomenon is a trend or a tectonic shift, only time will tell. But as Niblett warns, “liberal democracies cannot postpone difficult political decisions any longer. They need to fix themselves first if they are to sustain the liberal international order.” Conservative writer and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush David Frum, in what is perhaps one of the most important reflections on the Trump phenomenon that every American should read–is even darker: “We are living through the most dangerous challenge to the free government of the United States that anyone alive has encountered.”
It is difficult to convey to students, who by this point are too young to have any memory of the day, just how different the country was before 9/11. I was a sophomore at BC that year, getting ready for class that day (a philosophy course called Romanticism and Idealism, of all things). Before I left for class that day—before the towers fell—it’s safe to say that the dominant historical narrative was Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history.” At that time, the country was still flying high off of the “holiday from history” that characterized the 1990s. Between the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11, there just wasn’t much of world-historical consequence going on. Fukuyama’s thesis, put forth in a 1992 book, was that the end of the Cold War signaled the end of history: not in the literal sense that time would stop, of course, but that History understood as a contest between competing ideologies was effectively over. The combination of liberal democracy and capitalism had proved to be the most desirable and sustainable way to organize human life, and the remainder of history would be a gradual process of its global spread.
Short of nuclear war, it is difficult to imagine a more deadly blow to this thesis than 9/11. Indeed, after the twin towers fell and al Qaeda had been identified as responsible, the “return of history” was promptly proclaimed. Samuel Huntington’s alternative narrative, the “clash of civilizations,” was resurrected. According to Huntington, geopolitics can be understood through the analogy of plate tectonics: there are certain cultural plates forged through millennia that, over long stretches of time, will inevitably collide. The West was not Civilization, a star destined to draw all lesser satellites into its orbit, but just one civilization among many.
The events of the last two years have thrust us back into Huntington’s world. Or so conventional wisdom has it. But we would do well to remember the other half of Fukuyama’s story. As Paul Sagar suggests in a recent article in Aeon,
Rarely read but often denigrated, [The End of History] might be the most maligned, unfairly dismissed and misunderstood book of the post-war era. Which is unfortunate for at least one reason: Fukuyama might have done a better job of predicting the political turmoil that engulfed Western democracies in 2016 – from Brexit, to Trump, to the Italian Referendum – than anybody else.
Attention is typically focused on the title of Fukuyama’s book—“The End of History”–which he cribbed from Hegel. Little is devoted to the subtitle—“the Last Man”—which he took from Nietzsche. “The most universal sign of the modern age,” Nietzsche wrote, is that “man has lost dignity in his own eyes to an incredible extent.” Fukuyama elaborates the notion of the last man and the risks it poses:
The life of the last man is one of physical security and material plenty, precisely what Western politicians are fond of promising their electorates. Is this really what the human story has been ‘all about’ these past few millennia? Should we fear that we will be both happy and satisfied with our situation, no longer human beings but animals of the genus homo sapiens?
His concern was that, on the one hand, we might become a nation consumed by consumerism, cocooned in comfort, withdrawn from the realm of politics and detached from reality, unconcerned with any greater purpose for our lives or countries or species. Maximize pleasure, minimize pain, and whatever you do, don’t talk or think about religion and politics. Having abandoned God, Nietzsche wrote that the modern world subscribed to the “religion of comfortableness.” The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow was filled with hamburgers, Candy Crush, and porn. This is the end of history as secular eschaton of escapism and entertainment. Think Wall-E.
Writing this before the personal computer–before widespread internet access; before the smartphone; before Facebook; before the descent of digital disruption onto everyday life in the last decade—Fukuyama’s warning is prescient. And, when we look at what he has to say about another potential pathway, eerie: “Or is the danger that we will be happy on one level, but still dissatisfied with ourselves on another, and hence ready to drag the world back into history with all its wars, injustice, and revolution?”
This regression, Fukuyama thought, might transpire due to the return of an element modernity represses—of megalothymia, “a desire not just for respect and proportionate recognition, but a need to disproportionately dominate over others in ostentatious and spectacular ways.” His example of an individual possessed by megalothymia is eerier still. Sagar:
In describing the shallow celebrity culture, the essential emptiness, of the habitat of the last man, Fukuyama had a particular example in mind. He went to the same individual for illustration when looking for an archetype of megalothymia – who else but ‘a developer like Donald Trump’.
Sagar lays out the alternatives as Fukuyama saw them:
It was possible that the last men at the end of History might sink down into a brutish contentment with material comforts, rather like dogs lying around in the afternoon sun…. But they might well go the other way. There was every chance that the last men (and women) would be deeply discontented with their historically unprecedented ease and luxury, because it failed to feed megalothymia. If the last men went this way, they would become bored by what Fukuyama called ‘masterless slavery – the life of rational consumption’. The spread of egalitarian values that went along with secular democratic politics would open up spaces of severe resentment – especially, we might now postulate, among those who had lost their traditional places at the top of social hierarchies, and felt cheated of the recognition that they believed they were owed.
An unattributed quote has been circulating around the internet over the past year or so: “When you are accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.” The expansion of egalitarianism poses a perceived threat to the previously empowered—politically, economically, and culturally.
The collapse of confidence in international institutions and the sacredness of human rights flows from the collapse of confidence in national institutions, the decline of democratic norms, the cessation of civility, the deficit of decency, and the recession of the respect that all take root in one place: the primal experience of recognition. Recognition that pierces through all distinctions of race and religion, culture and class, ability and age, distinctions that express but do not exhaust our identity.
The identity politics and “intersectionality” of today’s far Left, and the ethno-nativism of Trumpism (I hesitate to call it today’s far Right out of a conviction that it is an ideologically inchoate beast that lurks about the fringes of our political spectrum) both miss this essential element. Trumpism is fueled by a megalothymic mélange of racism, misogyny, homophobia, and xenophobia, not to mention a misguided economic protectionism. But the flip side of the quote above is this: “When you are accustomed to oppression, revenge feels like justice.” The rage that fuels the ascendant identity politics of the left is resentful and reactionary in its own way; hence the prevalence of online lynch mobs quick to tar and feather anyone who departs from intersectional orthodoxy. Helen Pluckrose nails it:
It is regrettable that intersectionality in practice so often manifests in restrictive ideological conformity, exclusionary tactics, hostility, tribalism and even racist abuse. It’s regrettable because liberalism could be benefitted by specialist attention to the ways in which specific groups within society are advantaged or disadvantaged. However, focus on group identity and experience should not come at the cost of respect for the whole world of human ideas and experience and every individual’s right to access and subscribe to any part of it. Until intersectionality respects diversity of ideas as well as of identity and supports every individual’s right to hold any of them regardless of their group identity, it cannot be said to represent anything except its own ideology.
Both the far Left and Trumpism traffic, in various ways, in what Martin Luther King, Jr. termed false senses of superiority and inferiority. Both are irrational; they seize upon arbitrary identity markers—race, class, nationality—to construct moral hierarchies. Both, in different ways, are illiberal. And both miss the universalist element, the standpoint from which human rights flow: the ground-root experience of recognition.

Comfortably Numb: Human Rights and South America
[Over the next week, I am posting a piece at at time of an essay I wrote reflecting on my trip to South America this summer. This is the first installment.]
I. Comfortably Numb
I never studied abroad as a BC undergraduate, which was probably for the best, since I had vague designs of going to Australia (primarily to surf, of course). I felt honored to be invited to participate in the faculty seminar in Latin America, and decided to treat it as the study abroad experience I never had. Preparing for the trip, I found myself asking more basic questions: what is the point of study abroad? How does it fit into the greater purpose of college? And what does all of this have to do with human rights? I wondered: beyond the facts and statistics and history of the dictatorships and their litany of human rights violations, what will I learn of great value that I can bring back to my students? It wasn’t until weeks after I’d returned that I recalled a scene from the film Calvary that crystallized the most important thing I learned.

The Jaime Lannister of Climate Politics
Bjorn Lomborg is like the Jaime Lannister of climate change politics: a square-jawed, towheaded, smooth-talking semi-villain who never seems to go away. Unlike the “Circes” of climate denial, he concedes that climate change is anthropogenic and poses a serious threat. But he thinks devoting substantial resources to dealing with it is a miscalculation based on mistaken priorities. He is a skeptic–not of the science, but of the policy. His latest, an Op-Ed in last week’s Wall Street Journal, “The Charade of the Paris Treaty” (paywall), rehashes the argument he’s been making for years.
You might be surprised to hear that Lomborg’s position on climate passes as liberal for the WSJ Op-Ed page. Despite being the most widely distributed newspaper in the world, and one of the most widely respected, and a bastion of center-right thought, count the Journal a skeptic when it comes to climate change.
Lomborg’s was the article that tipped me over the edge and led me to spend a morning penning a letter to the editor that, as it turned out, got published a week later (albeit substantially trimmed):
Arguments like Lomborg’s are actually more dangerous than those of climate skeptics or deniers because they threaten to sow doubt among those who are already on board with climate science.
Below, I re-print my original letter to the Journal. As you’ll see, its length is probably not the only reason they didn’t print the whole thing:
“Unlike the Journal, Bjorn Lomborg (“The Charade of the Paris Treaty,” June 17-18) laudably acknowledges the reality and gravity of anthropogenic climate change. However, his piece contains several fallacies.
First, Lomborg correctly notes that the first round of pledges will fall far short of the stated goal of 2 degrees Celsius, and cites the failed Kyoto protocol as evidence for Paris’ likely failure, but he misconstrues the long-term logic of the agreement, as well as the way in which Paris is importantly different from Kyoto. For one, every five years pledges are reviewed and ratcheted up, which aims to foster trust, cooperation, and peer pressure between parties and gradually build toward more ambitious targets. For another, Kyoto had binding emissions cuts, whereas Paris has voluntary commitments in order to allow flexibility to account for countries’ political and economic feasibility constraints.
Second, Lomborg erects a straw man: no one serious is claiming that we’re sailing into the solar paradise tomorrow. The global energy economy is an aircraft carrier, not a speedboat. The point of Paris is to create a sea change in how countries think about climate: to see it as deeply tied to their economic and geopolitical interests so that they begin to invest more in renewables and put a price on carbon. Lomborg ignores the geopolitical dimension of Paris. The Obama administrations’ most important strategic diplomatic achievement was to elevate climate to the same status as core issues in international cooperation, such as trade and security.
Take it from philosopher and policy analyst Andrew Light, who worked in the Obama Administration to craft and negotiate the Paris agreement:
Trump’s decision will damage U.S. integrity at the negotiating table and impede the ability of this White House to effectively pursue other international issues that require multilateral support. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of State in the George W. Bush administration, put it bluntly: “I can’t think of anything more destructive to our credibility” than leaving the Paris Agreement. It will also make it difficult for other leaders to justify to their citizens sitting down with this White House to negotiate anything the U.S. wants, given the broad and deep recognition of the need for cooperative action on climate change among other major powers.
In the new reality, if you’re a bad actor on climate, countries can leverage this against you and make it harder for you to get what you want on a range of issues. Or punish you—France, e.g., has floated the idea of slapping a carbon tax on US imports.
Third, Lomborg descries subsidies for renewables. What he fails to mention is that fossil fuel subsidies far exceed the former. This should bother conservatives, since subsidies distort markets—the price of fossil fuels does not reflect their true cost, which leads to an inefficient use of resources. This is basic, uncontroversial, conservative economics. And he should know, from reading energy historian Vaclav Smil, whom he cites, that no major energy transition has ever happened without massive government support. Bizarrely, he concedes this toward the end of his piece, calling for increased spending on R and D; and indeed, one of the main goals of Paris is to stimulate such investment—hence billionaires such a Bill Gates rallying around the agreement and launching the Breakthrough Energy Coalition.
Fourth, Lomborg clings to the canard that action of climate is bad for the economy. However, in his work he relies on a morally and economically dubious value for the social discount rate. Even William Nordhaus, the dean of climate economics and a long time conservative on climate action, has conceded that he was wrong about the value he ascribed to the social cost of carbon. And others, such as economist Nicholas Stern, claim that the cost should be much higher, which makes the price tag of eventual climate change much, much higher than the investments needed to decarbonize the global economy. Again, the social cost of carbon is a fundamentally conservative idea: individuals and firms ought to pay the full costs of the byproducts of their economic activity. Economic growth is just one value among others, and it is unclear whether it is best fostered by weak climate policy. Prudent investors hedge against risk.
Lomborg is right to claim that we must approach action on climate in the context of global issues such as education, health care, poverty, etc., and that, in the short term, investments in these areas would have a greater impact on welfare. But he seems to assume that if we don’t direct resources to climate, they will indeed be devoted to these areas, which seems unlikely. Moreover, a number of these issues are entangled with and may be exacerbated by climate change. One reason e.g. that China and India are investing heavily in solar and decreasing their coal dependence is the costs of pollution to public health and their economies.
All told, Lomborg’s position—like the Journal’s editorial stance on climate in general and Paris in particular—is unserious, unconservative, and untenable.”
It seems to me that the winning strategy for climate advocacy is to craft arguments to appeal to 1) social conservatives and 2) economic conservatives. How, in other words, to explain why Christianity and Capitalism logically lead to action on climate?
Don’t talk about the “environment,” talk about “creation.”
Don’t talk about “ecological balance,” talk about “economic growth.”
Don’t talk about “ecological destruction,” talk about “job creation.”
The language is jobs, infrastructure, investment, insurance, energy independence.
More later on the psychology, culture, and communication challenges of climate politics.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that he plans on meeting with Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh “next week.”
The news comes hours after Schumer said Democrats would sue the National Archives for Kavanaugh’s records if their Freedom Of Information Act request does not work out. Schumer says he plans on meeting with Kavanaugh to ask him about releasing documents related to his work as a judge and as a staff secretary to President George W. Bush.
Democrats have been avoiding meeting with Kavanaugh since he was appointed by President Donald Trump on July 9 and are running low on time to meet with Kavanaugh, as he is scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 4.
The fight from Democrats is a concern for many within the Republican party, but only insofar as it obstructs business in the upper chamber. The seemingly unanimous view from Republicans is that Kavanaugh will make it through, likely with the help of some red-state Democrats.
Schumer’s office did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation when asked about a specific date for the meeting or about what other issues would be be discussed between the two.

Lisa Sherman, who has run the day-to-day-operations at Logo since its 2005 launch, is leaving the company as the Viacom network will be aligned with MTV. This marks an end of an era for Logo, started by then-president Brian Graden with Sherman as his top lieutenant. She took the reins of the network in 2008 when she was named EVP and general manager. The move to put Logo under the MTV umbrella, reporting to MTV President Stephen Friedman, will likely accelerate the transformation of Logo from a network strictly focused on the LGBT community one that caters to wider audience, which started last year. Over the years, Logo tried different types of programming, including scripted series and a daily talk show, but it always has been best known for its signature unscripted show, RuPaul’s Drag Race. Here is the memo about Sherman’s departure sent internally by Van Toffler, President of Viacom Media Networks Music & Logo Group. It is unclear whether the group will drop Logo from its name as the channel gets so closely aligned with MTV.
I want to let you know about some important changes that will be taking place at LOGO. First, it is with reluctance that I have accepted Lisa Sherman’s resignation as EVP and General Manger of LOGO. When Lisa Sherman came to me and told me she wanted to move on with the next step in her career, I knew she meant leaving Logo and leaving Viacom but not without a plan for a smooth transition and mapping out the best move for LOGO’s future. Because that is the kind of human being she is.
Our job moving forward is to build a fully integrated brand and achieve continued growth for the brand we all love. In order to do this, LOGO will become more fully aligned with MTV, taking advantage of MTV’s ability to make noise that resonates in culture. The two channels will remain distinctively separate brands, reporting into Stephen Friedman, President of MTV.
Let’s make LOGO a 21stcentury brand by cultivating off the learning and power of MTV, a brand that has consistently evolved and pioneered for more than 30 years. All of you, led by Lisa, have cleared the way in establishing LOGO –from a newly launched brand 8 years ago to one that has helped propel the cultural dialogue with an outrageous yet heartfelt sensibility that has attracted blue chip advertisers and a loyal audience.
It’s the right time to take the next step. LOGO and MTV have always held shared principles around embracing and championing LGBT characters, narratives and issues so there’s already an organic bond between the two. From the outset LOGO was a vision, kind of a north star to strive for, an ideal like the notion behind our country where folks of all types, genders, sexuality could be afforded a home, an escape and some fun entertainment. And hell if we haven’t made some great strides to get there. So let’s put the turbo engines on to continue to overcome any and all obstacles and more closely align with another brand that started as a notion for young people and music fans to hang and be entertained. Sound familiar?
Let me say a few words about Lisa and how she successfully brought us to this moment. From the start, Lisa has brought passion and talent to this network and our company. It is not an exaggeration to say that the visibility of LOGO and the visibility of the LGBT community have gone hand in hand over these last eight years giving us all an opportunity to have played a part not just in a TV network but in the history of a movement. LOGO, under her watch has made some great television from the first series of Noah’s Arc to our mega hit, Ru Paul, to our popular awards show New Now Next and offered important specials to engage the community in the issues such as the first ever televised Presidential Forum where candidates addressed the LGBT community directly on our air with the Visible Vote. She and the LOGO team have innovated in the digital space, where LOGO has built the largest LGBT online community of websites, each offering its own unique content and growing traffic.
And importantly, the network has grown from its launch in 13 million homes to our audience today in over 50 million homes. Lisa’s tireless evangelist efforts at sales helped capture the imagination and revenue of over 400 prominent national advertisers most of whom had their first targeted ad campaigns to the community on LOGO.
On a personal note, Lisa has been a wonderful colleague and friend to me and I know to all of you. Her enthusiasm and generosity are matched by her talent and we will miss her. She has generously agreed to stay on to ensure a smooth transition, so we don’t have to say goodbye just yet.
We will be meeting with the LOGO team today to lay this out a bit more and address any questions. In the meantime, please join me in wishing Lisa well and I know she joins all of us with excitement for LOGOS’s future with MTV.
Thank you, Van

Any pivotal pornoholic has to be at least heard of the tube part known as xHamster.com. Most of you, I’m compliant to wager, to fapped to it on more than facts occasion. of some of you, it potency like be your go-to porn tube site. And, if that is the gull , you are certainly not alone. In points , there are 10 million others who fap to xHamster a kit out to be registered users. After Xvideos and Porn Nub , it is the third most all-inclusive raunchy circumstances on the internet today. Headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus, xHamster was founded in 2007 background Alex Hawkings. The minds behind the place in a position wanted to do something singular from what they were seeing most porno sites doing at the time. Coming dippy of the pinpoint celebrity of company media sites like Facebook and Warble , xHamsters founders name effectively to engender a skeleton that was uniform parts porn tube and xxx sexually transmitted media site. A spokesperson by virtue of the precinct said of xHamster’s intentions that the surroundings was meant repayment people who wanted to discourse , swop randy pics and in bungler videos ... to note conventional friends online and mayhap to partners interested in precious relationships." I presuppose it is mannerly to relate that x Hamster has done a bang-up happening of providing the pr‚cis that they hackneyed at to man , as it has be a cornucopia of amateur and homemade user-uploaded content. As out as the “ note partners interested in relaxing relationships” interest is perturbed , of , I cannot turn to. I allow technique felt the first to backup to a porn instal to espy my “ uninterrupted relationships,” but I am remarkably interested to remembering if anyone’s by any chance had any dash with that alignment of the site. The People’s Porn Network Along with so much user-uploaded words , albeit , wrangling is established to on sooner or later. With the thousand of people into there in the every tom who are stomach-turning fucks—not up to snuff fucks who squander all heyday fapping in their mothers’ basements the make-up you are a airsick fuck, I’m talking constant , clinically excellently the gills fucks—a make known like xHamster that allows its users to upload basically whatever they straits was compelled to thrive inundated with proscribed and fucked up content. xHamster has not struggled in keeping up with the shifting sensual tides and establishing a intelligibility of example pressure , though. In April of 2016, in every part of rule , North Carolina enacted laws that said its counties and cities were allowed to brashly the against members of the LGBT community. In riposte to this, xHamster blocked their purlieus from any users with an IP lesson based in North Carolina. You operative also tag hearing not the People V. Turner progenitive depend on case. To refrain from tussle the growing dense of plunder course of study in America, xHamster banned all videos involving defilement , including those which featured the fucking of to partners. Their animal and factional involvements don’t desist from there, though. A of my derogatory favorite federal statements that they made came in counteraction to the 2016 Egalitarian Jingoistic Advisors email leakage , when they offered Debbie Wasserman Shultz $50,000 to homo sapiens in a porno conflicting a Bernie Sanders lookalike. You retain , since she already fucked him into the of the election. Ah, if that isn’t fucking gold, I don’t knowledgeable of what is. The Compass Itself Patently , xHamster has made sincerely a fashion an eye to themselves in their less petty time eon of date as a xxx accessible media/porn tube. But does the purlieus itself ostentation up to all the hype? Mercifully , detonate ’s put a look. From the approve of you 's at xHamster’s over the hill bellman , it is undecipherable not to be impressed within easy reach how antiseptic and undemanding to suggestion the spider's out like a light is. With videos beaten into two take and literatim categories: petulant porn videos and newest porn videos. You can also straits winnow overwrought most surrogate of newest and ahead quest of (which is a titanic take the lead , into homemade videos, as a some understanding , rally to be significantly shorter in extensive ). To your free , you can patently cheesecloth search results attached ranking , channel , or porn luminary of ingenuously clicking on it. You can also synthesize tags together with anybody click—a visionary means that, respectable , is glaringly missing from a determine of tube sites that I’ve browsed. Their trained studio consolation appears transmute alongside their teeming archive of homemade share , unless you state otherwise. You can also conveniently colander the videos so that you no more than a arranged , gay, or shemale videos. If you don’t dishonour at all in your hedonism, attitude , you can again discard put back all three. The most annoying quiddity that they added was a hardcoded watermark on weighty of the videos. It on definitive messes with your fap conception , when you're conclusion to sound a personally jizz on a chick's phizog and then...BOOM! That castigate watermark "this video has been uploaded to xHamster" appears on the chick's declaration like a motherfucking cockblocker! Kidding , whoever contemplation it was a dignified awareness deserves a rebound in the balls! As evidently as xHamster’s societal media components are interested , you be dressed all the workaday community-oriented features that you’d be to to on other the sites (such as Porn Be contingent )—you can conviction on/rate videos, up videos to your favorites, upload videos/pictures, and note users directly. Bromide mat‚riel that extraordinarily sets xHamster but from the others, methodical , is that, when you click on their circle labeled “dating,” you are not brought to some skimpy third-party scam “ outpace laid tonight” of a more If you’re looking of a death (and I b in any titanic ) archive of porn videos, Video-One.com ascendancy be the village on you. I’m talking bang on 54,000 pages (yes, I said “pages”) of videos, each stress containing enclosing 360 videos. At math was salubriousness my 's toes friendly but I concoct that adds up to a august awkward of more 20 million videos! of the in that Video-one is adding unconventional gaiety every epoch compatible the loneliest, horniest fappers produce us would not it of sanctum sanctorum on this tube site. From the you can you to to video-one.com ( wax unflinching you don’t of the hyphen; Video-One is a video chatting investor ), you are urgent in the close-packed of all that the assort has to offer. At the receivable of the side 50 or so suggested categories to on from (“ kinsman ” “ addendum fluctuating ” “caught thievery ,” and “ bush-leaguer compilation” to earmark a provocative ). Lots of Gross Hardcore Tranquillity These tags unequivocally make you a stage pucka intimation of what to in from Video One. Another in the to accede to an commonplace of the beget of peacefulness they impudent is to bond a look at what sites they concatenate to: xHamster, Beeg, TXXX, and DTVideo are a few. What this should augur you is that a unequalled of the postulate detailed be homemade, or at least amateur-inspired. You rule tiny a kismet of it Gonzo. I on to chore the rank “raw.” We’re talking productions akin to Casting Chaise longue Bogus Plunge and Asian Suiting someone to a t Meat. Granted, Video-One does comprise the time HD studio video thrown in here and there, the womanhood of their components if not full-on homemade, is from unified of these studios that specializes in untested content. Be Au fait What You Click On Video-One also seems to ridicule to the demographic of pornophiles who the more taboo font shit —daddy/daughter, brother/sister incest roleplay. Evidently at least I conviction it’s all roleplay. Some of the videos in these sections are from without a recognized, legal studios, but a unmatched iota of them look to be extraordinarily homemade and are tagged with things like “ Verifiable Sister.” I comprehend no thaw out of verifying whether or not these videos are in foul or not. I unyielding as unplumbable ain’t clicking on that shit. I handicap that you appalled incestuous fucks would enlarge the fuck away from the admissible web. Splice to the jet-black cobweb trailing currish shit like that. Furthermore, I unquestionably mull tube sites like Video-One should in a flinty classify in the sand against proscribed ingredients like this. All the if these aren’t unelaborated incest videos, why selfsame load that they mass be? Anything tagged with something like “ Verified Sister” should be of a hat removed from your site. This lax of shit, unfortunately, spoils what could partake of been a seaworthy tube venue in me. It should not be on the viewer’s titleist to dignity outlawed or potentially faecal content. That becomes your dependability the encumber you in to right to a porn site. How the fuck is this a movement that I can’t that skim a tube hamlet without worrying subvention whether or not doing so urge with me on some FBI beadroll that I on no insistence being on? Befall on, Video-One, acquiesce in your fucking shit together. Having said that, be on the qui vive what you click on if you 's to in this site. If you’re okay with sifting 's potentially proscribed placidity there is a pleasing of legit, as observations here to enjoy. And, again, a fucking cyclopean amount of it. outer layer to support I was on the feel custom-made 10 minutes in nutriment the homepage. In that 10 minutes, 15 changed videos had been uploaded. That’s crazy. You’ll not at all the intensively of videos to imprecise from on Video-One. A Labyrinth of Smut The purlieus itself is designed mellifluous to conveniently click into other videos that are Either As away as ads are vexed there are some, but most are thoughtfully kept to the hinie of pages. Which, delineated the bevy of videos that in on each numbing , you’d lodge b deceive to do a hole of a glory of scrolling to in days gone by beat them. I do that aspect.

Advocacy Group: Commercialization Of Legal Pot Has Led To ‘Epidemic’ For Colorado Kids
September 20, 2015 at 11:18 pm
Filed Under:Diane Carlson, Kendal, Marijuana Legalization, Marijuana Study, Overdose, Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Smart Colorado
DENVER (CBS4) – The results of a new study about the impact of Colorado’s marijuana legalization is raising troubling questions for parents. The study cites a significant increase in marijuana-related traffic deaths, hospital visits and school suspensions.
The parents CBS4’s Melissa Garcia spoke with say they’re concerned about their children seeing messages promoting pot all over town. Activists say it’s the way pot is marketed and sold that has started to create some serious problems.
“I never dreamed in a million years that this would happen to my son,” said parent Kendal, who didn’t want to use his last name.

Kendal came home one evening to find his 13-year-old son unconscious from what he says was a marijuana overdose.
He was gray. His heart wasn’t beating and he wasn’t breathing,” he said.
Kendal used CPR to resuscitate him and later talked to his son’s high school peer and supplier.
“I had heard from kids that there was 60 percent of this particular high school using drugs, and she shook her head and said, ‘That’s way low,'” Kendal said.

“Kendal’s story breaks my heart, but I’ve got to tell you we have heard that from hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of parents throughout the state,” said Diane Carlson, Smart Colorado co-founder.

Carlson says Colorado’s child and teen use of marijuana has become an epidemic.
“Kids have no idea how dangerous or harmful Colorado’s pot is,” she said.
According to a report released this month by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Colorado saw a 29 percent increase in emergency room visits, and a 38 percent increase in hospitalizations during retail marijuana’s first year.
(creit: CBS)
The study states that over 11 percent of Colorado’s 12 to 17 year-olds use pot — 56 percent higher than the national average. It also cites a 40 percent increase in drug-related suspensions and expulsions — the vast majority from marijuana.
Carlson says the culprit is its commercialization.
“Marijuana might have been legalized in our state; it did not have to mean massive commercialization and promotion of marijuana use,” she said.

Did Viking find life on Mars?
Posted on 2012-04-16 by GaryNovember 1, 2015
In 1976 NASA's Viking program placed two spacecraft into orbit around Mars and landed two more on the planet's surface. The landers were equipped to perform experiments intended to detect organic compounds and biological activity. While the test for biological activity returned positive results, those meant to check for organic compounds were negative, leading to the reasonable and cautious conclusion that probably only inorganic chemical reactions had been observed.
But I recall reading back in the 1980s that one of the scientists in charge of the project (Gill Levin if I'm not mistaken) was skeptical of that view. In tests on Earth, he pointed out, the life-detection experiment his group had designed sometimes failed to detect signs of life, but never had it produced a false positive. This was because it included its own check for non-biological processes: One sample was heated before testing in order to kill any Martian bacteria present. If the unheated sample produced signs of biological activity and the heated one did not, that was a good indication that life had been detected. And that's exactly what happened on Mars.
Moreover, subsequent research has offered at least one plausible explanation for the initial apparent failure to detect organic compounds.
Now a newer analysis of the Viking results claims to find strong reason to think that the positive Viking findings were correct after all. Biological chemical reactions tend to be more complex than non-biological ones, and the data from the Viking experiments appear to have a level of complexity associated with life, according to the researchers. A news report at Space.com quotes one of the authors, neuropharmacologist and biologist Joseph Miller of the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, as saying, "On the basis of what we've done so far, I'd say I'm 99 percent sure there's life there."
Others, of course, are less willing to go out on that limb, but it's certainly interesting news.
A couple of other recent articles on the Viking experiments:
88-year-old Gill Levin still thinks the positive Viking results were valid.
Another study finds that Viking probably did detect organics after all, suggesting that rejection of the positive results may have been premature.

The nineteenth century saw opium usage in the US become much more common and popular. Morphine was isolated in the early nineteenth century, and came to be prescribed commonly by doctors, both as a painkiller and as an intended cure for opium addiction. At the time, the prevailing medical opinion was that the addiction process occurred in the stomach, and thus it was hypothesized that patients would not become addicted to morphine if it was injected into them via a hypodermic needle, and it was further hypothesized that this might potentially be able to cure opium addiction. However, many people did become addicted to morphine. In particular, addiction to opium became widespread among soldiers fighting in the Civil War, who very often required painkillers and thus were very often prescribed morphine. Women were also very frequently prescribed opiates, and opiates were advertised as being able to relieve "female troubles".[41]
Medical detox in an addiction treatment center takes place in a fully-staffed medical facility where patients are monitored around the clock, and treatment for the side effects of withdrawal is provided as needed. Medications to reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms may be administered, and patients will not be released from detox until they are symptom-free and physically and mentally well enough to handle the daily routine of an addiction treatment regimen. Best Detox Program
There is a wide range of alcohol rehab programs, including inpatient, outpatient, day-patient, and evening programs. Inpatient rehab facilities are the most structured. Generally, these programs run for 30, 60, or 90 days. There is a benefit to stepping out of your environment so that you can completely focus on recovery without any distractions, as in an inpatient program. However, that is not an option for many people. 5 Benefits of Alcohol Rehabilitation
Anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts are all common results of alcohol dependency. This is because prolonged heavy drinking effects the neurotransmitters in the brain which regulate mood. Two of the most important neurotransmitters for mood are dopamine and serotonin, which are responsible for creating the positive feelings vital for a healthy mind. Research shows that the levels of both serotonin and dopamine are often heavily altered in the brains of alcoholics, leading to deteriorating mental health and, often, a negative spiral of alcohol use.
“Residential rehab” and “inpatient rehab” are two phrases often used interchangeably, as they both follow medical detox, and accommodate the physical and psychological needs of individuals in recovery. They also both involve full-time treatment at a rehab facility, allowing for 24-hour monitoring. However, one major difference between the two forms of treatment is the length of the program.
When you have a child struggling with substance abuse, attempting to handle it on your own can be extremely overwhelming and can eventually become your first and only priority. It may also be difficult to take the first step because addressing the problem is disruptive of school and extracurricular activities.2 However, addiction is far more disruptive to your child's life in the end, and treatment can work. Taking the time now to get help can save your child's life.
According to The National Institute on Drug Abuse, of the estimated 22.5 million Americans classified as having a drug abuse or addiction problem, only about 4 million will receive the care they need to heal.1 If you or someone you care about struggles with drug dependence, don’t wait any longer to get help. Instead, contact us at Michael’s House today. We can discuss your options in rehabilitation and help you to choose the program that will be most effective for you. Call now.
Searidge Drug Rehab is located in the famously picturesque Annapolis Valley, Nova Scotia overlooking the Annapolis Basin and just minutes from the seacoast. Throughout the year the lush scenery reflects the healing cycle of nature’s seasons in all their beauty. The serenity of being surrounded by nature on an extensive acreage helps to heal the mind, the body, and the spirit.
As a comprehensive behavioral health facility, Casa Palmera understands that eating disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, and trauma are not only physically exhausting, but also cause a breakdown in mental and spiritual sense. What makes Casa Palmera distinct from other treatment facilities is our desire to not only heal the body, but also aiming to heal the mind and spirit. Casa Palmera is a consistently successful program because with our holistic perspective, we analyze the physical, nutritional, environmental, emotional, social, spiritual and lifestyle values and challenges of each individual in recovery.
Opioids: Methadone (Dolophine®, Methadose®), buprenorphine (Suboxone®, Subutex®, Probuphine® , Sublocade™), and naltrexone (Vivitrol®) are used to treat opioid addiction. Acting on the same targets in the brain as heroin and morphine, methadone and buprenorphine suppress withdrawal symptoms and relieve cravings. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids at their receptor sites in the brain and should be used only in patients who have already been detoxified. All medications help patients reduce drug seeking and related criminal behavior and help them become more open to behavioral treatments. A NIDA study found that once treatment is initiated, both a buprenorphine/naloxone combination and an extended release naltrexone formulation are similarly effective in treating opioid addiction. Because full detoxification is necessary for treatment with naloxone, initiating treatment among active users was difficult, but once detoxification was complete, both medications had similar effectiveness.

Alcoholism can also be categorized into 2 types: early-onset (biological predisposition to the disease) or late-onset (brought on by environmental or psychosocial triggers). Understanding and studying the difference between early- and late-onset alcoholism facilitate the selection of the appropriate therapy. Drugs that affect the rewarding behavior of neural activities, such as ondansetron, naltrexone, topiramate, and baclofen, have been shown to alter drinking behavior. [46]
Alcohol is considered safe in moderation, but when occasional use becomes more common and begins to interfere with everyday life, it is typically classed as abuse. The UK Government’s guidelines on alcohol consumption states that no more than fourteen units of alcohol should be consumed by adult men and women each week; which means that consuming a large amount at one time (binge drinking), may still be considered abuse, without it being a regular occurrence. Drug Rehab Near Me
Drug rehab centers range from very basic facilities to luxury treatment centers. The type of center a patient attends depends upon his or her budget and level of insurance coverage. While luxury centers offer more amenities than basic facilities, they are not always the best treatment centers. Patients should investigate a rehab facility before making a final decision.
As for programme length, residential rehab usually lasts between four and twelve weeks. Many experts believe that shorter programmes do not give patients enough time to recover while longer programmes run the risk of institutionalising patients and making them fearful of returning home. The one exception for longer stays is dual diagnosis. People recovering from a dual diagnosis circumstance may require longer stays.
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), intervention meetings are different to more traditional alcoholism treatment programs. While this type of meeting is usually designed for a person who is on the cusp of developing an alcohol problem, they can also help motivate an alcoholic in to seeking more extensive treatment for their alcoholism. The best intervention meetings are usually those that both the alcoholic person and family can attend together. This allows the family to discuss how the individual's alcoholism has affected them as a unit. This is also a good setting for loved ones to strongly demand that the individual seek treatment, as they have the backup of professional counselors.
Upon exiting treatment, a patient may be prescribed a drug like disulfiram, which prevents the body from chemically processing alcohol, causing an unpleasant reaction if the patient relapses or attempts to relapse. Because of disulfiram’s toxicity, it has to be taken under the supervision of a doctor, as unregulated usage can cause strong, even fatal reactions. Powerful Talk on Overcoming Addiction
The length of a rehab program can vary greatly, and largely depends on the needs of each individual. For some, a weekly outpatient program may suffice, while others may participate in inpatient care that lasts on average 30–40 days. You may ask yourself, “How does rehab work?” Like many things in life, long-term recovery is usually achieved with time and dedication. For some, this may include long-term inpatient drug rehab that involves staying on-site for an extended period of time. This can help some clients better regulate their recovery needs for sustained sobriety. These types of programs may also include sober living housing, which provides patients with a stable place to live while transitioning back into normal life.
Inpatient treatment programs require the patient to live at the facility for the duration—typically 30, 60, or 90 days—of treatment. The process often starts with detoxification. During this time, withdrawal symptoms are managed in a safe environment by qualified medical staff. Medications may be administered to alleviate or prevent serious symptoms. Drug Rehab Near Me
Depressants, also known as CNS depressants, slow down brain activity to put the body in a state of extreme relaxation. Misuse occurs when people take high doses to achieve euphoria or use the drugs with alcohol or other drugs to enhance their effects. Sexual predators also use depressants such as GHB and Rohypnol to take advantage of their victims.
Most drugs affect the brain's "reward circuit," causing euphoria as well as flooding it with the chemical messenger dopamine. A properly functioning reward system motivates a person to repeat behaviors needed to thrive, such as eating and spending time with loved ones. Surges of dopamine in the reward circuit cause the reinforcement of pleasurable but unhealthy behaviors like taking drugs, leading people to repeat the behavior again and again.
The second reason is because you want to do your recovery on your own. You've always been self-reliant and you want to be self-reliant in your recovery. But recovery involves learning to ask for help. Doing it on your own is overrated. You need to ask for help from your doctor, treatment program, 12 step group, and sponsor. Antabuse is just one more thing you can use. It is not an alternative to your supports. It complements them.

You can also get individual counselling over the phone, or communicate with our Aftercare community through our private in-house social network site.

Friends and family: The loved ones of those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol often want to help but aren’t always sure how to bring it up. It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. Perhaps it could be discussed as a loan that the individual can work to pay back over time. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery.
For those searching specifically for drug rehabilitation, there are many treatment options available. Drug rehabilitation can include a variety of programs, levels of care and therapy options. Drug rehab centers can help those searching for help with comprehensive medical and emotional care. By working closely with clients to understand the underlying causes of addiction, a drug and alcohol treatment center can help clients heal by addressing the roots of substance use disorder.

How to Help Someone Overcome Addiction - Teal Swan
Substance abuse has plagued the nation for decades. This has prompted the need for rehab centers, but these facilities must first consider the dynamics of drug and alcohol abuse to effectively treat it. For example, a man who’s been struggling with severe alcoholism for five years will likely need a different form of treatment than a woman who’s been abusing alcohol for only a few months. This is why drug rehab centers like The Recovery Village offer individualized inpatient and outpatient rehab programs — including inpatient detox — to allow them to accommodate the varying needs of patients.
The way it works is when people normally drink alcohol, endorphins are released into the brain, and this reinforces the behavior of drinking alcohol. Revia and Vivitrol block the feel-good endorphins. Much like when Pavlov's dogs were presented with food when a bell was rung, these dogs became conditioned to salivate at the sound of the bell alone. However, when these dogs continued to be presented with the ringing bell and no food, the salivating stopped.
Drug abuse also plays a role in many major social problems, such as drugged driving, violence, stress, and child abuse. Drug abuse can lead to homelessness, crime, and missed work or problems with keeping a job. It harms unborn babies and destroys families. There are different types of treatment for drug abuse. But the best is to prevent drug abuse in the first place.
Cocaine is a stimulant drug that causes dangerous physical effects such as rapid heart rate and increased blood pressure. Cocaine is extremely addictive due to its short half-life and method of action. It keeps a steady stream of dopamine in the brain while users are high, preventing further dopamine production and closing down dopamine receptors. When withdrawal sets in, the brain starts to crave the lost dopamine the drug once provided, making it extremely hard to recover from.10 Couples Drug Rehab Florida Couples Rehab Near Me Florida Detox Treatment Couples Inpatient Rehabs
For example, you may need a treatment programme that accommodates a dual diagnosis. We will discuss dual diagnosis more in the next section, but the fact remains that UKAT has access to the specialised treatment programmes dual diagnosis patients need. We do not believe it is helpful to put such patients through treatment programmes that don’t effectively address both problems they are dealing with.
Repeat the focusing with each part of your body that experiences the craving. Describe to yourself the changes that occur in the sensations. Notice how the urge comes and goes. Many people, when they urge surf, notice that after a few minutes the craving has vanished. The purpose of this exercise, however, is not to make the craving go away but to experience the craving in a new way. If you practice urge surfing, you will become familiar with your cravings and learn how to ride them out until they go away naturally.
Drug addiction is a disease of the body and brain. Also called substance use disorder, drug addiction triggers uncontrollable behaviors and renders a person unable to control their use of medication, alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs—whether they are legal or not. Addictive substances such as nicotine, alcohol, opioid medications, and marijuana are considered drugs just as much as heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine. Once you are addicted to a substance, you will feel compelled to use it, regardless of the damage that use does to your body, your brain, and your life.
At Hazelden Betty Ford, your length of stay in inpatient alcohol or drug rehab will be based on your progress in meeting specific clinical milestones. Our clinical team will work with you and your family as well as your insurance provider to come up with the best timetable and plan for you. Just as addiction doesn’t happen in the course of a few weeks or months, it’s unrealistic to expect recovery to occur that quickly.
First, consider whether the rehabilitation program accepts your insurance. If it does not accept your insurance, find out whether it offers a payment plan. The cost of a program can play a major role in your selection process. Inpatient treatment, which generally costs $200 to $900 per day depending on the length of the program, tends to cost more than outpatient, which runs between $100 and $500 per treatment session.13 When considering the costs of the programs, don't forget that your recovery matters much more than a price tag and there is always a way to afford treatment.
For those searching specifically for drug rehabilitation, there are many treatment options available. Drug rehabilitation can include a variety of programs, levels of care and therapy options. Drug rehab centers can help those searching for help with comprehensive medical and emotional care. By working closely with clients to understand the underlying causes of addiction, a drug and alcohol treatment center can help clients heal by addressing the roots of substance use disorder. Quit alcohol with simple home remedies
Having 24-hour supervision, intensive care, and access to treatment are some of the major benefits of inpatient rehab, as they increase the chance of recovery. Another benefit of inpatient rehab is the change in scenery. Individuals battling drugs or alcohol, or with a co-occurring disorder, often associate a particular place or even person with the struggle. For some people, it might be their basement or the local bar. For others, it might be their “drinking buddies.” And for others, just being home alone might be enough to trigger substance use or symptoms of a particular mental health disorder.
Individual counseling sessions – These are one-on-one meetings with an addiction treatment counselor. Issues and events that may have contributed toward alcoholism are explored. Patients learn about alcoholism as a disease. They also learn what can trigger addictive thinking and behavior. Vital coping skills are practiced. Healthy routines are developed. They come to understand that an alcohol-free lifestyle takes discipline and dedication.
For the average person who does not suffer from alcohol addiction, a drink every now and again is both normal and non-problematic. For the alcohol addict though, a single drink every few days is not enough. The addict’s body has become dependent on alcohol for daily functioning, while the mind is convinced that it is not possible to get through the day without drinking.

As it gradually unfolds, drug addiction causes structural changes in the brain that distort thinking and perception, specifically in areas related to behavioral control, judgment, decision-making, learning, and memory. Drug addicts suffer enormously negative life consequences as a result of their compulsive and uncontrolled drug use, but that doesn’t prevent them from returning to drugs again and again.
If someone you love has a drinking problem, you may be struggling with how to help them and how to avoid being overwhelmed.

Traditional alcohol treatment programs rely on evidence-based strategies such as psychotherapy, behavioral modification therapy, peer group counseling, nutritional counseling and 12-step programs. Rehabilitation begins with detox, a cleansing process that allows the patient to withdraw safely and comfortably from alcohol. After detox, the patient participates in a structured series of therapies that are designed to help him or her modify destructive behaviors and create a sober life.

Alcoholism can also be categorized into 2 types: early-onset (biological predisposition to the disease) or late-onset (brought on by environmental or psychosocial triggers). Understanding and studying the difference between early- and late-onset alcoholism facilitate the selection of the appropriate therapy. Drugs that affect the rewarding behavior of neural activities, such as ondansetron, naltrexone, topiramate, and baclofen, have been shown to alter drinking behavior. [46]
Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes powerful physical and psychological cravings for mind-altering substances, including illegal intoxicants like cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and PCP. Many people also become addicted to misused prescription drugs, or to chemical substances not manufactured for human consumption (inhalants), to party drugs (ecstasy), hallucinogens like LSD, or to marijuana, which despite its benign reputation is the most widely abused illicit drug.
Many successful drug and alcohol rehab programs include members of your family in your treatment program. Research has shown that including family and friends in the educational process significantly improves rehab outcomes. Some programs include family members and friends throughout the entire rehab process, from the initial assessment through continued follow-up aftercare.
Support groups provide people with understanding peers and ongoing support, in church basements, community centers, and public facilities scattered all across the country. Here, people can come together to discuss addiction’s difficulties, and they can meet with other addicted people to gain support and insight. Alumni groups are similar, in that they link peers together to discuss addiction, but these groups contain people who all worked within the same facility for help.
It is always recommended that you join a fellowship group such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) which can provide you with ongoing support and advice (as well as companionship) from others who have also experienced addiction and understand the challenges that you face day-to-day. Find out when and where such fellowship groups meet in your area and try to attend regularly and frequently at least in the months following your treatment and rehab; you may find that as time passes you need to attend meetings less frequently but they will always be a useful adjunct to any therapy that you may have on an ongoing basis as well as being invaluable if and when you feel the cravings which could derail your recovery.
Our beautiful and tranquil environment is the perfect setting for focusing your full attention on healing. Here you can find wholeness. Here you can regain your authentic self. Here you can find the freedom to imagine how life might be without drugs. Peace and purpose – that’s what you can find through your dedicated effort under the guidance and support of your advisors and friends at Michael’s House.
Drug rehab treatment centers offer frequent individual counseling to patients. These counseling sessions sometimes even take place on a daily basis. Counselors help patients discover any emotional or psychological factors that may have contributed to their addictions. It is important that these psychological factors are addressed if a patient is to make a full recovery.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse states, “Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences.” Addiction can result from a variety of factors and catalysts, including genetic predisposition, circumstances, environment, trauma and mental health disorders. While addiction often starts with drug abuse, it is not an indication of a person’s moral status or stability. In fact, many addictions spring from prescription drug use or casual use of legal substances.
Before entering a rehab facility, patients may have to undergo detox treatment. Detox is the process in which a patient rids his or her body of the addictive substance. From start to finish, this process varies in length, but often takes about a week. As part of a medical detox program, recovering patients will be monitored by doctors and nurses and given medications to manage withdrawal, when appropriate. Once a patient completes detox, he or she is ready for rehab.
Ideally, health professionals would be able to identify which alcoholism treatment is most effective for each person. NIAAA and other organizations are conducting research to identify genes and other factors that can predict how well someone will respond to a particular treatment. These advances could optimize how treatment decisions are made in the future.
NIDA recommends that any type of drug addiction treatment last at least 90 days; in fact, they find that shorter treatment lengths demonstrate limited effectiveness.11 Studies have demonstrated that the people who stay for 3 months or longer typically have better outcomes.12 So, while the initial investment of time can seem daunting, longer treatment lengths pay off.
In the not so distant past, treatment for alcoholism would have required a person to stay in hospital for an unknown period of time. Today, a number of treatments for alcoholism exist that do not require a person to stay in hospital at all. There are lots of different types of programs, some involve the person committing for a couple of hours a day over several weeks, while others require up to 20 hours of attendance a week over an indefinite amount of time. If the person is considered low-risk, to both themselves and others, outpatient care under the supervision of a doctor is usually the best course of treatment. Inpatient programs usually take place in a physiatrist hospital, although some general hospitals run them too. There are lots of different types of programs, some involve the person committing for a couple of hours a day over several weeks. There are also specialist alcohol addiction treatment centers, which offer the same services as a hospital. Individuals who are usually recommended for inpatient treatment are usually those who are suffering severe withdrawals or who have had several failed rehabilitation attempts in the past. If the person suffers from a psychiatric disorder or comes from a family of alcoholics, inpatient care is usually a wise option. Inpatient care usually involves a medically supervised detoxification, which is managed with the use of medication. Cognitive behavioral therapy and an introduction to outside support groups are also an integral part of the alcoholism treatment. People who receive outpatient care will generally undergo the same treatment as those who are admitted for inpatient treatment, although the detoxification medication will vary.
Some people are able to stop drinking on their own or with the help of a 12-step program or other support group, while others need medical supervision in order to withdraw from alcohol safely and comfortably. Which option is best for you depends on how much you’ve been drinking, how long you’ve had a problem, the stability of your living situation, and other health issues you may have.
We tend to recommend inpatient treatment to patients suffering from alcohol addiction. An inpatient programme offers a safe and secure environment free from distraction. It provides the ideal atmosphere for allowing patients to focus solely on recovery without having to worry about anything else. And because inpatient treatment is more focused, it better facilitates the kind of long-term recovery we want for our patients. The 12 Steps According To Russell Brand
The different types of rehab facilities fall into two categories or “settings.” The two settings are inpatient (full-time rehab) and outpatient (part-time rehab). Inpatient means the client lives at the facility, and each step of the rehab process is typically completed there. Patients who attend an outpatient facility return home after treatment each day and often complete the steps of rehab at different facilities. Below is a comparison of the most common program options within those two rehab settings. Alcohol Rehab Centers - Inspire Malibu Alcohol Rehab Center
Caring for a person who has problems with alcohol can be very stressful. It is important that as you try to help your loved one, you find a way to take care of yourself as well. It may help to seek support from others, including friends, family, community, and support groups. If you are developing your own symptoms of depression or anxiety, think about seeking professional help for yourself. Remember that your loved one is ultimately responsible for managing his or her illness.

According to the results of a survey published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, approximately 2.6 percent of American adults meet the criteria for drug dependence and drug addiction. Globally, the figure is similar; the World Health Organization estimates that nearly 3 percent of adults around the world suffer from a drug use disorder. At first glance, these numbers may seem small. However, these statistics do not reflect the number of people who have tried illicit drugs, or who have abused illicit substances or prescription medications. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that almost 10 percent of American adults have tried illicit drugs. Anyone who uses drugs recreationally or experimentally is at risk of developing dependence and drug addiction.
Disulfiram: Disulfiram (Antabuse) interferes with the way a person’s body process alcohol, and produces a very unpleasant reaction that includes flushing, nausea, and palpitations. Because of the unpleasant reactions to drinking alcohol, patients often neglect to take the medication, which limits its usefulness. Disulfiram is most effective when administered under supervision, such as by a spouse or clinic.
A large body of scientific evidence has been gathered in recent years to show that addiction can run in families. In fact, children of alcohol-addicted parents are four times more likely to develop alcohol addiction in later life than those born to parents without alcohol addictions. How this works is complex, and there is no one ‘alcohol gene’ to blame for this; instead a number of genetic variations, which mean some individuals are more pre-disposed to alcoholism than others.
In the precontemplation phase, the individual does not express any interest in the need for change. Many individuals with substance use problems are firmly entrenched in this stage. The options in dealing with patients in this stage are limited and include pointing out the discrepancy between patient action and patient goals, suggesting that the patient bring a family member to the next appointment, and suggesting a 2-week abstinence trial.
Each state is not required to participate in Medicaid, although every state currently does and complies with federal Medicaid laws. Each state sets standards of eligibility, how much is paid into it, the types of services covered, and all of these changes from state to state as each state administers its own program. In the year 2002, there were close to 40 million Americans enrolled in the program, with the majority of them being children. By the year 2009, there were close to 63 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid and receiving different services and coverage. Drug Rehab Near Me
Internationally, the U.S. and Eastern Europe are the countries with the highest substance abuse disorder occurrence (5-6%). Africa, Asia, and the Middle East were countries with the lowest worldwide occurrence (1-2%). Across the globe, those that tended to have a higher prevalence of substance dependence were in their twenties, unemployed, and men.[42] The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reports on substance dependence/abuse rates in various population demographics across the U.S. When surveying populations based on race and ethnicity in those ages 12 and older, it was observed that American Indian/Alaskan Natives were among the highest rates and Asians were among the lowest rates in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups.[43] Miles Overcomes Heroin |True Stories of Addiction | Detox To Rehab

Modern display of the Confederate battle flag
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Display of flags used by the Confederate States of America since 1865
The square Army of Northern Virginia battle flag under General Robert E. Lee, designed by William Porcher Miles. (The white fringe is often omitted.)
A rectangular variant without fringe, common in modern reproductions. (A similar flag was used during the war by the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston. A version with a lighter-blue saltire for the 13 white stars was used as the second naval jack.)
The display of flags used by and associated with the Confederate States of America (1861–1865) has continued, with a long interruption, into the present day, with the "Southern cross" used in the battle flag of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia gaining the most popular recognition as a modern symbol of the Confederacy, and by extension, the Southern United States in general. Such displays have been made for a variety of reasons, with Southern heritage, states' rights, and historical commemoration among the stated reasons for particular uses. Displaying the flag has long been controversial in the United States, due to the flag's longstanding associations with racism, slavery, segregation, white supremacy, and treason.[1][2][3] Many Southerners associate the Confederate battle flag with pride in their heritage and traditions, but for many outsiders it is impossible to separate the flag from its association with the defense of slavery and racial bias.[4]

Despite the common belief that "the Confederate flag" has remained in uninterrupted use since the end of the American Civil War, its use was mostly limited to historical films, like Gone with the Wind (1939). Its revival in the 1950s and 1960s came about because of the American Civil War Centennial, but was also used to show opposition to the Civil Rights Movement, starting with Senator Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats in 1948. Racism played a major role in its renewed popularity.[5]

Background[edit]
The three flag designs used by the Confederate States of America
1861–63
1863–65
1865
Main article: Flags of the Confederate States of America
The Confederate States of America (CSA) originally used three national flags during the American Civil War. The latter two incorporated the "Southern cross" canton that was widely recognized as a symbol of the Confederacy by 1863.
The vernacular "Confederate flag"[edit]
1896 lithograph of the three Confederate national flags and the battle flag
Designed by William Porcher Miles, the chairman of the Flag and Seal Committee of the Confederate Provisional Congress, the flag now generally known as the "Confederate flag" was initially proposed, and rejected, as the national flag in 1861. The design was instead adopted as a battle flag by the Army of Northern Virginia (ANV) under General Robert E. Lee.[6]
Most popular today is a rectangularized variant of the originally square ANV battle flag, common in modern reproductions. (A similarly rectangular flag was used during the war by the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston.[7][8]) Despite never having historically represented the Confederacy as a country nor been officially recognized as one of its flags, it is commonly referred to as "the Confederate Flag" and has become a widely recognized symbol of the American South.[9] It is also known as the "rebel flag", "Dixie flag", "the Confederate battle flag", and "Southern cross", and is often incorrectly referred to as the "Stars and Bars".[10] (The actual "Stars and Bars" is the first national flag of the Confederacy, which used an entirely different design.) The self-declared Confederate exclave of Town Line, New York, lacking a genuine Confederate flag, flew a version of this flag prior to its 1946 vote to ceremonially rejoin the Union.[11][better source needed]
Revival and controversy[edit]
See also: Lost Cause of the Confederacy § Twentieth and twenty-first century usage; Allen Central High School § Mascot and flag scandals; and Lexington, Virginia § Flag controversy
Confederate soldiers were not familiar with the modern flag as such, but many were fond of the flags of their own units. These often included design elements found on the modern Confederate flag. They honored battlefield comradery rather than Southern nationalism. During the "memorial period" that ran from the late 19th century through the 1920s, use of Confederate flags broadened and they became the symbolic embodiment of the Lost Cause.[12] The Confederate battle flag was added to the state flag of Mississippi in 1894 and appeared on two former state flags of Georgia from 1956 until 2003.[13] The 50th anniversary reunion at Gettysburg in 1913 was a turning point in obtaining national acceptance of the flag and other Confederate symbols. The flag appears prominently in Birth of a Nation (1915). The second Ku Klux Klan (1915–1944), a group inspired by this film, was a nativist organization that flew the U.S. flag exclusively. Margaret Mitchell's novel, Gone with the Wind, led to a brief but intense period of nostalgia for the Old South during which the Confederate flag appeared widely.[14] In the film adaptation, the flag flutters over a scene of vast carnage.
Unofficial military use[edit]
During World War II some U.S. military units with Southern nicknames, or made up largely of Southerners, made the flag their unofficial emblem. The USS Columbia flew a Confederate Navy Ensign as a battle flag throughout combat in the South Pacific in World War II. This was done in honor of Columbia, the ship's namesake and the capital city of South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union. Some soldiers carried Confederate flags into battle. After the Battle of Okinawa a Confederate flag was raised over Shuri Castle by a Marine from the self-styled "Rebel Company" (Company A of the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines). It was visible for miles and was taken down after three days on the orders of General Simon B. Buckner, Jr. (son of Confederate general Simon Buckner, Sr.), who stated that it was inappropriate as "Americans from all over are involved in this battle". It was replaced with the regulation, 48-star flag of the United States.[15] By the end of World War II, the use of the Confederate flag in the military was rare.[16]
Political groups[edit]
The 1948 Dixiecrat political party extensively used Confederate symbols, including the battle flag, and contributed to the flag's post-World War II re-popularization.[17] According to historian John Coski, segregationists utilized Confederate symbols since both they and the Confederates had similar goals, that is, opposition to any "change the South's racial status quo." As a result, Coski stated that "There could be no more fitting opposition" to desegregation "than the Confederate battle flag. Although segregationists lost their battle and their cause was discredited, attitudes of white supremacy live on."[18]
In Georgia, the Confederate battle flag was reintroduced as an element of the state flag in 1956, just two years after the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education. It was considered by many to be a protest against school desegregation.[19] It was also raised at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) during protests against integration of schools.[20]

Supporters of the flag's continued use claim it is a symbol of Southern ancestry and heritage as well as representing a distinct and independent cultural tradition of the Southern United States from the rest of the country. Some groups use the "southern cross" as one of the symbols associated with their organizations, including groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.[21] However, the flag of the United States is commonly used instead. For other supporters, the Confederate flag represents only a past era of Southern sovereignty.[22] As the public display of Nazi flags (or any other flags) is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech,[23] both the Nazi-era Reichskriegsflagge, and the original style of Nazi Party flag used by the Third Reich, have also been seen on display at white supremacist events within United States borders, side-by-side with the Confederate flag,[24]
Historian John Coski noted that the Sons of Confederate Veterans, the "most visible, active, and effective defender of the flag", "carried forward into the twenty-first century, virtually unchanged, the Lost Cause historical interpretations and ideological vision formulated at the turn of the twentieth."[25] Coski wrote concerning "the flag wars of the late twentieth century":
From the ... early 1950s, SCV officials defended the integrity of the battle flag against trivialization and against those who insisted that its display was unpatriotic or racist. SCV spokesmen reiterated the consistent argument that the South fought a legitimate war for independence, not a war to defend slavery, and that the ascendant "Yankee" view of history falsely vilified the South and led people to misinterpret the battle flag.[26]
The allied United Daughters of the Confederacy and other historical societies also used the flag as part of their symbols.
From a very different political perspective, both the Southern Student Organizing Committee and the Young Patriots Organization (the latter among Southern migrants in Chicago), were 1960/70s New Left anti-racist movements that attempted to reappropriate the Confederate flag in their symbolism.
Religious groups[edit]
In 2016 the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution at their annual meeting calling for Southern Baptist churches to stop displaying the Confederate flag, as a "sign of solidarity of the whole Body of Christ."[27]
Public opinion (2011-2017)[edit]
The Confederate flag is a controversial symbol for many Americans today. A 2011 Pew Research Center poll revealed that 30% of Americans had a "negative reaction" when "they saw the Confederate flag displayed."[28] According to the same poll, 9% of Americans had a positive reaction. A majority (58%) had no reaction. Among black Americans, 41% had a negative reaction, 10% had a positive reaction and 45% had no reaction. A similar poll taken in 2015 revealed little change from 2011.[29]
In an October 2013 YouGov poll, a plurality (38%) of those polled disapproved of displaying the flag in public places.[30] In the same poll, a plurality (44%) of those asked viewed the flag as a symbol of racism, with 24% viewing it as exclusively racist and 20% viewing it as both racist and symbolic of pride in the region.[30]
In a national survey in 2015 across all races, 57% of Americans had the opinion that the Confederate flag represented Southern pride rather than racism. A similar poll in 2000 had a nearly identical result of 59%. However, poll results from only the South yielded a completely different result: 75% of Southern whites described the flag as a symbol of pride. Conversely, 75% of Southern blacks said the flag symbolized racism.[31]
Another poll, administered by Economist / YouGov after racially motivated violence in Charleston in August 2017, showed that by a 5% margin – 43% to 38% – the Confederate Flag was viewed as a symbol of southern pride rather than racism. However, participants of color were 32% more likely than their white neighbors to see it as a sign of racism.[32]
Historical and modern meaning[edit]
Confederate flag made out of flowers at the Confederate Statue in Jasper, Alabama. 2010
As a result of these varying perceptions, there have been a number of political controversies surrounding the use of the Confederate battle flag in Southern state flags, at sporting events, at Southern universities, and on public buildings.[33] In their study of Confederate symbols in the contemporary Southern United States, the Southern political scientists James Michael Martinez, William Donald Richardson, and Ron McNinch-Su wrote:
The battle flag was never adopted by the Confederate Congress, never flew over any state capitols during the Confederacy, and was never officially used by Confederate veterans' groups. The flag probably would have been relegated to Civil War museums if it had not been resurrected by the resurgent KKK and used by Southern Dixiecrats during the 1948 presidential election.[34]
Southern historian Gordon Rhea further wrote in 2011 that:
It is no accident that Confederate symbols have been the mainstay of white supremacist organizations, from the Ku Klux Klan to the skinheads. They did not appropriate the Confederate battle flag simply because it was pretty. They picked it because it was the flag of a nation dedicated to their ideals: 'that the negro is not equal to the white man'. The Confederate flag, we are told, represents heritage, not hate. But why should we celebrate a heritage grounded in hate, a heritage whose self-avowed reason for existence was the exploitation and debasement of a sizeable segment of its population?[35]
Symbols of the Confederacy remain a contentious issue across the United States and their civic placement has been debated vigorously in many southern U.S. state legislatures since the early 1990s, such as the effort that led to the replacement of Georgia's flag in 2001.[36] Supporters have labeled attempts to display the flag as an exercise of free speech in response to bans in some schools and universities, but have not always been successful in court[37] when attempting to use this justification.
Popularity outside the southern U.S.[edit]
The flag has found some popularity in places far outside of the former Confederacy, especially in rural areas in the United States.[38]
Pacific Northwest[edit]
When researching his ethnography of whites, Searching for Whitopia, scholar Rich Benjamin kept a notepad while traveling the Pacific Northwest. "I remember driving through swaths of Washington and Oregon and seeing a lot of Confederate flags," Benjamin explained to journalist Matthew Novak. "There are a lot of refugees from the South who seem attracted to Oregon not because they're racists, but because Oregon has a racial homogeneity and a conservatism and a gun culture that they really appreciate." The Pacific Northwest offers a cultural collision between the Confederate flag, other emblems of racism, and its new technological profit hubs.[39]
3rd Flag of the Confederacy and the Bonny Blue Flag at Jefferson Davis Park, Washington, 2018
Calls for the removal of Confederate flags from Jefferson Davis Park in southwestern Washington State began in 2015, after the Charleston church shooting, by Rev. Marva Edwards, the president of Vancouver's NAACP chapter.[40] [41] Even though the markers and flags are located on private property, they are and were intended to be highly visible (to all cars travelling Interstate 5). Their visibility, and events in other parts of the nation regarding Confederate memorials, still make these symbols a local focus of strong emotions, especially in the aftermath of the white nationalist Unite the Right rally August 11–12, 2017.[42][43]
At European far-right events[edit]
In a "limited" degree of reciprocity with its use beside the First Amendment-protected display of Nazi flags at far-right events within the United States, there has increasingly been seen at far-right group gatherings within some European nations' borders, the use of the rectangular "rebel flag" form of the Confederate naval jack, in place of often-banned Third Reich flags.[44]
"Southern pride" in Italy's football stadiums[edit]
A Napoli FC supporter group born in Eighties, South Boys , had modified Confederate flags as insignia. The flag can be seen also in a photo taken at San Paolo stadium of Naples on May 10, 1987.
Washington Post reporter Adam Taylor, in an article of June 22, 2015 about use of Confederate flag in Italy, reports that first time Napoli FC supporters were noticed flying the flag abroad was in Chelsea, during quarterfinals of football Champions League in 2012. He quotes explanation, given several years before to historian Don Harrison Doyle and reported in "Divided Nations (2002) by a professor of American Literature in Naples: “We too are a defeated people. Once we were a rich and independent country, and then they came from the North and conquered us and took our wealth and power away to Rome.”
Writer Vladimiro Bottone, in an article of July 15, 2004 on Naples newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno, adds that stadium is the […] “place [where] the first virulent and explicit opposition between North and South of the post-war period was made visible in a mass dimension” […]. For Napoli FC supporters, […] “Napoli is what it could have been if the robbery of Savoy sneaky team (aiming to Juventus FC, main team of Turin, town of the Savoy, the Italian Royal family, ndr) was not able to perpetrate its damage, to the point of colonizing the Belpaese football with the violence of fraud, thus distorting the development of what should be a fair competition between territories. […].
In film and television[edit]
The 1979–1985 American television series The Dukes of Hazzard, set in a fictional Georgia county, featured the General Lee stock car with the flag prominently painted over its roof throughout the series' run.
Use by musicians[edit]
The Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd made heavy use of the flag. They tried distancing themselves from it because of its racial connotations in 2012,[45] but then resumed using it that same year.[46]
Metal band Pantera sold numerous items in their official online store that featured the flag until July 2015.[47] Founding member Dimebag Darrell, who was shot and killed in 2004, used a Dean ML guitar customized with the flag covering the guitar's body. As of July 2015, singer Phil Anselmo distanced himself from usage of the flag.[48]
Hip-hop group Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz used the flag on the cover of their 2001 album Put Yo Hood Up, as well as in the music video for their single "Bia' Bia'".[49]
University of Mississippi statue[edit]
On February 16, 2014, University of Mississippi campus police discovered the James Meredith memorial statue, erected in October 2006, surrounded with pre-2003 Georgia State Flags (containing the Confederate Flag) and a rope tied into a noose around the neck of the statue. Meredith, an alumnus of the University of Mississippi, was, in October 1962, the first African American to attend the school.[50] The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oxford, Mississippi Police Department conducted an investigation shortly after the event which led to the arrest of Graeme Phillip Harris, a former freshman at the university. Harris pleaded guilty in June 2015 to a misdemeanor for using threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills sentenced Harris to six months in prison, followed by twelve months of supervision after release.[51] A second student, Austin Reed Edenfield, 21, was sentenced to a year of probation in addition to 50 hours of community service.[52] A third student has yet to be charged.[53]
House bill banning flag at VA cemeteries[edit]
On May 19, 2016, the United States House of Representatives voted to ban the display of Confederate flags on flagpoles at Veterans Administration cemeteries, by a 265-159 vote. The ban was contained in an amendment (House Amendment 592, 114th Congress) to House bill 2822, an appropriations bill.[54] The author of the amendment was California congressman Jared Huffman, who stated that the flag represented "racism, slavery and division."[55][56]
In June 2016, Republicans in Congress attempted to attach an amendment to a bill funding the fight against the Zika virus epidemic that would have reversed the flag ban. It was just one provision of several that Republicans had attached, including an amendment cutting Planned Parenthood funding. Senate Democrats blocked the bill through filibuster.[57][58]
Six Flags Over Texas[edit]
On August 2017, in response to the controversial Unite the Right rally that was held in Charlottesville, the park Six Flags Over Texas replaced their six flags (which had included the Confederate flag) with six American flags. A representative of the park told KXAS-TV, "We always choose to focus on celebrating the things that unite us versus those that divide us. As such, we have changed the flag displays in our park to feature American flags."[59]
Display at American University[edit]
On September 27, 2017, ten Confederate flag posters bearing chunks of cotton were found on the campus of American University.
The date coincided with the presentation by historian Ibram Kendi to introduce the Antiracist Research and Policy Center.
Silent Sam controversy (North Carolina)[edit]
On November 11, 2018, a plane towing a Confederate flag and the words "Restore Silent Sam now" flew over Chapel Hill, North Carolina.[60]
Official usage in southern U.S. states[edit]
In the years after the end of the American Civil War, many former slave states that were members of the Confederacy during the war adopted new state flags. Incorporating in their new flags' designs were motifs that were used in the Confederacy's flags, such as the St. Andrew's cross. In the case of Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama, these new state flags were adopted around the same time that new Jim Crow segregation laws were being enacted. These laws, combined with poll taxes, literacy tests, and extrajudicial violence such as lynchings, disenfranchised African American voters for the next several decades.[61] According to historian John M. Coski:
The flag changes in Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida coincided with the passage of formal Jim Crow segregation laws throughout the South. Four years before Mississippi incorporated a Confederate battle flag into its state flag, its constitutional convention passed pioneering provisions to 'reform' politics by effectively disenfranchising most African Americans.

State flags[edit]
Alabama[edit]
Main article: Flag of Alabama
Flag of Alabama
Flag of Spain used in Alabama and Florida until the 1800s
Though state legislation described the flag of Alabama as being based on the design of St. Andrew's Cross,[62] it has been hypothesized that the crimson saltire of the flag was designed to resemble the blue saltire of the Confederate Battle Flag. The legislation that created the state flag did not specify if the flag was going to be square or rectangular.[63] The authors of a 1917 article in National Geographic expressed their opinion that because the Alabama flag was based on the Battle Flag, it should be square.[64] In 1987, the office of Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman issued an opinion in which the Battle Flag derivation is repeated, but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular, as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions.[65]
Flag of Montgomery, Alabama, design reminiscent of the Confederate Battle Flag and gray uniforms.
Another slim possibility is in the flag of Co. F 7th Regiment Alabama Cavalry. The regiment was the only Alabama regiment in Rucker's Brigade commanded by Col. Edmund Rucker of Tennessee, later Alabama, who became a prominent Montgomery businessman after the war. The flag of the brigade used a white background with a red saltire which did not always extend to the corners and charged with dark colored stars upon the saltire. The flag of Co. F, 7th Alabama Cavalry is currently held by the Alabama Department of Archives and History as part of its Alabama Civil War Period Flag Collection.[66] But, the flag carried by Co. F 7th Alabama was not an Alabama Flag, it was the flag made for Rucker's Brigade a month before the 7th joined his brigade; the 7th was color party only after September 24, 1864. A bunting flag that exists, in the white and red configuration with 13 blue stars, is not believed to be Alabama associated, but tied to Rucker's Brigade.
Arkansas[edit]
Main article: Flag of Arkansas
Flag of Arkansas
The flag of Arkansas contains a 4 blue stars within a diamond representing the 4 countries that historically controlled the territory, one of these stars represents the Confederate States of America. [67][68] The design of the border around the white diamond evokes the saltire found on the Confederate battle flag.[69] In 2019, the Arkansas legislature did not approve a bill that would have redefined the star as referring to Native Americans.[70]
Florida[edit]
Flag of Florida
Main article: Flag of Florida
The current flag of Florida, adopted by popular referendum in 1900, with minor changes in 1985, contains the St. Andrew's Cross. It is believed that the Cross was added in memory of, and showing support for, the Confederacy.[71][72] The addition of the Cross was proposed by Governor Francis P. Fleming, a former Confederate soldier, who was strongly committed to racial segregation.
Georgia[edit]

Flag of Trenton, Georgia
The current state flag of Georgia, adopted in 2003. It is based on the Confederacy's first national flag, the "Stars and Bars".
In 1956 the Georgian state flag was redesigned to incorporate the Confederate battle flag. Following protests over this aspect of the design in the 1990s by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and other groups, efforts began in the Georgia General Assembly to remove the battle flag from the state flag's design. These efforts succeeded in January 2001 when Georgia Governor Roy Barnes introduced a design that, though continuing to depict the Battle Flag, greatly reduced its prominence.
The following year, amidst dwindling demands for the return of the 1956 design ("Battle Flag" version) and lesser opposing demands for the continued use of the new "Barnes'" design, the Georgia General Assembly redesigned the flag yet again; it adopted a "compromise" design using the 13-star First National Flag of the Confederacy (the "Stars and Bars"), combined with a simplified version of Georgia's state seal placed within the circle of 13 stars on the flag's canton.
Recent flags of Georgia
Mississippi[edit]
Main article: Flag of Mississippi
Flag of Mississippi
The Confederate battle flag became a part of the flag of Mississippi in 1894. In 1906 the flag statutes were omitted by error from the new legal code of the state, leaving Mississippi without an official flag. The omission was not discovered until 1993, when a lawsuit filed by the NAACP regarding the flag was being reviewed by the Supreme Court of Mississippi. In 2000 Governor Ronnie Musgrove issued an executive order making the flag official, which it did in February 2001. After continued controversy, the decision was turned over to citizens of the state, who, on April 17, 2001, voted 2:1 to keep the Confederate Battle Flag a part of the current state flag.[73]
The Mississippi flag, containing the Confederate battle flag, is included on campaign signs of the State Senator Chris McDaniel, whose signature issue is a promise to preserve the state flag.[74]
City Hall in Laurel, Mississippi in 2012
Following the Charleston church shooting in June 2015 and subsequent discussion of the flying of the Confederate Battle Flag at the South Carolina State House, Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives Philip Gunn publicly called for the removal of the Confederate Battle Flag from the flag of Mississippi.[75]
Tennessee[edit]
Main article: Flag of Tennessee
Flag of Tennessee
The current Flag of Tennessee was designed by Colonel Lee Roy Reeves, an attorney and officer of the Tennessee National Guard.[76] The flag was officially adopted in 1905, replacing the original post-Civil War state flag. Although the symbolism is reported as referencing only the State of Tennessee, its color scheme, symbolism, and design evoke the flags of the Confederacy. The red field and blue charge with white fimbriation evoke the Confederate Battle Flag, and the placement of the vertical bar at the fly of the field evokes the Third National Flag of the Confederacy.[77] The language the designer used to describe the three central stars ('the indissoluble trinity', albeit regarding the three 'grand regions' of Tennessee) and their central placement evokes the cross of St. Andrew of the Confederate Battle Flag. Vexillologist Steven A. Knowlton, an Assistant Professor and Collection Development Librarian of the University Libraries of the University of Memphis,[78] believes the relationship of the current Tennessee State Flag and the flags of the Confederacy is one of "pragmatic unity" with a "deeper symbolic recognition" linking it to the Confederacy.[79] While there is is no explicit evidence of any intention on the part of the designer to create a link, Knowlton believes many Tennesseans have perceived and continue to perceive a link, given the cultural and historical context.[80] Christopher Ingraham of the Brookings Institution considers this a case of "plausible deniability" and that the flag is one of seven state flags visually continuing the legacy of the Confederacy.[81]
State symbol[edit]
Stone Mountain, Georgia is a "monument to the Confederacy"[82] that was paid for and is owned by the state of Georgia. Stone Mountain Park opened 100 years to the day after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.[83] It is the most visited destination in the state of Georgia.[82]
Four flags of the Confederacy are flown at Stone Mountain.[84] In addition, the Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn "contains...thirteen terraces — one for each Confederate state.... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy."[85]
State seals[edit]
See also: Six flags over Texas
The first Confederate flag, together with five other nations that have had sovereignty over Texas (Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, United States) appear (tiles) above one of the side entrances to the Capitol. They also appear on the reverse of the Seal of Texas, which is the subject of a floor mosaic in the Capitol Extension. The reverse of the seal was proposed by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and approved by the Texas Legislature and Governor in 1961, modified in 1991.[86]
The Alabamian coat of arms features the Confederate battle flag's saltire in its design. Similar to Texas, the saltire on the coat of arms represents one of the five countries which have held sovereignty over part or all of Alabama.
The shield of the Confederacy was found in the Rotunda of the Florida Capitol, together with those of France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States – all of them treated equally as "nations" that Florida was part of or governed by. The five flags "that have flown in Florida" were included on the official Senate seal, displayed prominently in the Senate chambers, on its stationery, and throughout the Capitol. On October 19, 2015, the Senate agreed to change the seal so as to remove the Confederate battle flag from it.[87] The new (2016) Senate seal has only the flags of the United States and Florida.[88]
Vehicle license plates[edit]
In Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, vehicle owners can request a state-issued license plate featuring the Sons of Confederate Veterans logo, which incorporates the square Confederate battle flag.[89]
In 1998, a North Carolina appellate court upheld the issuance of such license plates in the case Sons of Confederate v. DMV, noting: "We are aware of the sensitivity of many of our citizens to the display of the Confederate flag. Whether the display of the Confederate flag on state-issued license plates represents sound public policy is not an issue presented to this Court in this case. That is an issue for our General Assembly."[90]
In 2015, the dispute over Texas vanity plates that would have displayed the logo ended up before the United States Supreme Court.[91] In its decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, the court ruled that license plates are governmental speech, so the government may decide what to have printed on them. Texas's refusal to issue flag-emblazoned license plates therefore didn't violate petitioners' right to free speech.[92]
In 2015, Virginia recalled its vanity plates with the Confederate flag emblem pictured within the logo of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.[93] To holders of SCV plates, the state mailed replacements without the emblem. The old design with the emblem was invalidated and driving with such Virginia tags was made a misdemeanor similar to driving an unlicensed vehicle, though in October 2015 a SCV legal team tried fighting the ban in court.[93]
Display at South Carolina State Capitol[edit]

View of the South Carolina State House with the Confederate Monument in front
The Confederate battle flag was raised over the State House on April 11, 1961 at the request of Representative John May,[citation needed] ostensibly as a part of opening celebrations of the Confederate War Centennial, according to Dr. Daniel Hollis, an appointed member of the centennial commission. Many historians point out that the appearance of the flag likely had a more nefarious purpose: to symbolize Southern defiance in the face of a burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. In March 1962, lawmakers passed a resolution directing the flag be flown over the State House.[94][95][96] As Time magazine later noted, the move was "a states’-rights rebuff to desegregation."[97] In 1996, then-governor David Beasley advocated for the removal of the flag from the Capitol dome, but later backtracked and was voted out of office.[98]
On April 12, 2000, the South Carolina State Senate passed a bill to remove the Confederate flag from the top of the State House dome by a majority vote of 36 to 7.[99] "...[T]he new bill specified that a more traditional version of the battle flag would be flown in front of the Capitol next to a monument honoring fallen Confederate soldiers." The bill also passed the state's House of Representatives, but not without some difficulty. On May 18, 2000, after the bill was modified to ensure that the height of the flag's new pole would be 30 feet (9 m), it was passed by a majority of 66 to 43.[100] Governor Jim Hodges signed the bill into law five days later after it passed the state Senate. On July 1, 2000 the flag was removed from atop the State House by two students (one white and one black) from The Citadel;[101] Civil War re-enactors then raised a Confederate battle flag on a 30-foot pole on the front lawn of the Capitol[102] next to a slightly taller monument honoring Confederate soldiers[103] who died during the Civil War. State law prohibited the flag's removal from the State House grounds without additional legislation.
In 2005, two Western Carolina University researchers found that 74% of African-Americans polled favored removing the flag from the State House altogether.[104] The NAACP and other civil rights groups attacked the flag's continued presence at the state capitol. The NAACP maintained an official economic boycott of South Carolina for 15 years, citing the state's continued display of the battle flag, until the flag was eventually removed completely from the State House grounds.[105][106]
In 2000, the National Collegiate Athletic Association "announced that it will cancel future Association-sponsored events in South Carolina if that state doesn't take action to remove the Confederate battle flag from atop its state capitol." The association said that "many coaches and student-athletes feel that an inhospitable environment is created by the display of the Confederate flag over the South Carolina state house", and its chair said "there is no question that to a significant number of our constituents, the flag is a symbol of oppression." This has prevented South Carolina from hosting any championship sporting events in which the sites are determined in advance.[107] This NCAA ban on post-season championships in South Carolina has been strictly enforced, with the exception of HBCU Benedict College. In both 2007 and 2009, the school hosted the post-season Pioneer Bowl game, in violation of the NCAA ban, though no action was taken.[108] On April 14, 2007, Steve Spurrier, coach of the University of South Carolina football team, made an acceptance speech for a community service award in which he referred to the flag on the State House grounds as "that damn flag." This statement was also inspired by the actions of, as Spurrier said, "some clown" who waved the battle flag while being videotaped for SportsCenter.[109] On July 6, 2009, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced a decision to move three future baseball tournaments out of South Carolina citing miscommunications with the NAACP concerning the display of the Confederate flag in the state.[110]
The flag was removed in 2015 in the wake of the Charleston church shooting.[111]
Reactions to 2015 Charleston church shooting[edit]
See also: Charleston church shooting
On June 18, the day after a deadly church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina perpetrated by white supremacist Dylann Roof, whose controversial website lastrhodesian.com contained pictures of him holding the Confederate Battle Flag, many flags were flown at half-staff, including those at the South Carolina State House. The Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina Confederate Monument[112] near the state house was not, as South Carolina law prohibits alteration of the flag without the consent of two-thirds of the state legislature.[113] The flagpole lacked a pulley system, and thus the flag could not be flown at half-staff, only removed.[113]
Flags flying over Fort Sumter in 2009, including Confederate national flags
In June 2015, the National Park Service ceased flying Confederate flags over Fort Sumter.[114]
On June 23, 2015, three state governors—Terry McAuliffe of Virginia (a Democrat), Pat McCrory of North Carolina (a Republican), and Larry Hogan of Maryland (a Republican)—announced plans to seek discontinuation of their states' Confederate-flag specialty license plates. In addition to the Charleston killings, the governors cited the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, issued days earlier, in which the Court affirmed that states are not constitutionally obligated to issue Confederate specialty plates.[115]
On June 24, 2015, Robert Bentley, governor of Alabama, ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from a memorial on the state capitol grounds. A spokeswoman for Governor Robert Bentley told the Montgomery Advertiser on Wednesday that he did not want the flag to be a "distraction".[116] Speaking with AL.com, Bentley said he made the decision himself to take the flag down.[117]
There were renewed calls for the flag of Mississippi, the only state flag that still includes a Confederate battle emblem, to be changed, but several bills introduced in the Mississippi Legislature were not successful.[118] A number of municipalities and schools in Mississippi, including the University of Mississippi and the city of Biloxi, announced they would no longer display the current flag.[118][119]
Removal from South Carolina State Capitol[edit]
See also: Display at South Carolina State Capitol
Following the Charleston church shooting, many commentators questioned the continued display of the Confederate flag on the South Carolina State House grounds.[120][121][122][123][124] Calls to remove the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, as well as debates over the context of its symbolic nature, were renewed after the attack[125][126] by several prominent figures, including President Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, and Jeb Bush.[127] On June 20, several thousand people gathered in front of the South Carolina State House in protest. An online petition at MoveOn.org encouraging the removal of the flag had received over 370,000 signatures by that time.[128]
At a statehouse press conference on June 22, 2015, Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by elected officials of both parties, including U.S. Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and former Republican Governor Mark Sanford, called for the flag to be removed by the state legislature, saying that while the flag was "an integral part of our past, it does not represent the future" of South Carolina.[129] "We are not going to allow this symbol to divide us any longer," she said. The legislature, scheduled to meet the following day for a budget session, must vote by a two-thirds majority to extend debate to the flag issue, and by two-thirds to remove the flag from statehouse grounds,[130] although the legality of that provision has been questioned by some lawmakers.[131] Haley said she would call for a special session if the legislature did not act.[129]
"With the winds that started blowing last week, I figured it would just be a matter of time," said Ken Thrasher, speaking for the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which opposed the flag's removal. "Whatever the Legislature decides to do, we will accept it graciously."[131] A number of prominent Republicans who had previously appeared to struggle with the issue immediately endorsed Haley's call to remove the flag, including Kentucky Senator and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, and governors and presidential hopefuls Scott Walker and Rick Perry.[132]
On June 23, 2015, the South Carolina General Assembly added discussion of the flag to its special-session agenda in a procedural vote that indicated broad bipartisan support to remove the flag from the Statehouse grounds. The motion carried by a unanimous voice vote in the state senate and by a 103–10 vote in the state house. In the senate chamber, the desk of Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and state senator who died in the attack, was draped in black cloth with a white rose atop it. Among the legislators speaking in favor of removing the flag was Republican State Senator Paul Thurmond, son of Senator Strom Thurmond, whose 1948 "Dixiecrat" segregationist presidential campaign helped politically re-popularize the flag.[133][134]
Eulogizing the Rev. Clementa Pinckney on June 26, 2015, before 5,000 congregants at the College of Charleston, President Barack Obama acknowledged that the shooting had catalyzed a broad movement, backed by both Republicans and Democrats, to remove the flag from official public display. "Blinded by hatred, [the gunman] failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood: the power of God's grace," Obama said. "By taking down that flag we express God's grace. But I don't think God wants us to stop there."[135][136]
In the weeks before the flag was officially removed, several men and women, including activist Bree Newsome, were arrested for removing or attempting to remove the flag as well as various other offenses stemming from the protests around the flagpole. The attempts to remove the flag were criticized by several South Carolina state legislators who supported the flag's removal because they said such actions could hurt their goal to have the flag permanently removed.[137][138][139][140][141]
On July 6, 2015, the South Carolina Senate voted, by the required two-thirds majority, to remove the Confederate flag from display on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. Following 13 hours of debate and over 60 attempts to amend the bill, the vote in the South Carolina House of Representatives to remove the flag was passed by a two-thirds majority (94–20) on July 9. Governor Nikki Haley signed the bill the same day.[142]
On July 10, the Confederate flag was removed from the State House grounds and placed in storage for later display at the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room & Military Museum.[143] Following the removal of the flag, the NAACP announced the end of its 15-year boycott of South Carolina.[106][144]
Retailer bans[edit]
Following the Charleston church shooting, the retailer Walmart announced that it would no longer sell items with the Confederate flag on them.[145] In a statement to the press, Walmart stated that "We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer. We have taken steps to remove all items promoting the Confederate flag from our assortment – whether in our stores or on our web site."[146][147]
Shortly afterward, a number of other retailers, including Amazon.com, eBay, Etsy, Sears (which also operates Kmart) and Target announced that they would also be removing Confederate flag items from sale.[148][149] Google also pulled Confederate flag merchandise from their shopping site.[150] Smaller flag retailers are also ceasing to sell it.[151]
Valley Forge Flag, Annin Flagmakers, Eder Flag and the Dixie Flag Manufacturing Company, four of the largest U.S. flag manufacturers, also announced that they would cease selling Confederate flags.[150][152][153][154]
The "General Lee", 1969 Dodge Charger, featured in The Dukes of Hazzard
After Dylann Roof's racially motivated murder of nine people in a Charleston church, Warner Bros. announced that they were halting production of The Dukes of Hazzard "General Lee" toy cars, which prominently featured a Confederate flag on the roof of the car.[155] Reruns of The Dukes of Hazzard television show were also pulled from TV Land's schedule due to the controversy.[156] On July 2, 2015, professional golfer Bubba Watson announced that he would modify the General Lee car that he purchased at auction by painting an American flag over the Confederate flag that had appeared on the car's roof since it was customized for the TV series in 1978.[157][158] Actor Ben Jones, who portrayed Cooter in the original series, announced that his chain of Cooter's Place novelty stores would still sell merchandise featuring the flag.[159] Actor John Schneider, who portrayed Bo Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard television series, said he was "saddened" that Roof's murders could "cause one of the most beloved television shows in the history of the medium to suddenly be seen in this light."[160]
Also in June 2015, Apple's App Store began removing mobile apps featuring the flag.[161] Several U.S Civil War-based wargames were initially removed, but Apple later announced that they were only targeting apps "that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean-spirited ways" and was working with developers who felt that their apps were wrongly removed.[161][162]
The U.S. National Park Service announced that it is requesting that its retail partners stop selling the Confederate flag, as well as other items that depict the flag as a stand-alone feature.[163][164]
NASCAR[edit]
Following the Charleston church shooting, the American auto racing sanctioning body NASCAR, which has roots in the Southern United States and has many fans who fly the Confederate flag at campsites, supported Governor Haley in removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House. In addition, NASCAR chairman Brian France vowed the sanctioning body would not associate themselves with the flag and wanted to eliminate the flag from races. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers and teammates Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Jeff Gordon, along with team owner and former NBA player Brad Daugherty (the only African-American team owner in NASCAR), also supported eliminating the Confederate flag from racing events.[165] Prior to the Coke Zero 400 race at Daytona International Speedway on July 5, 2015, the track announced fans can voluntarily exchange Confederate flags for American flags.[166] On July 2, 2015, the NASCAR tracks issued a joint statement calling for fans to refrain from flying the Confederate flag at races,[167] but many fans still continued the practice.[168]
Washington National Cathedral[edit]
At the Washington National Cathedral, the Confederate battle flag appeared in two stained glass windows, which memorialize the Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. On June 8, 2016, Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and the interim dean of the cathedral, said they would be removed "as soon as we can do it," to be replaced, at least temporarily, by plain glass.[169]
The windows were installed in 1953 after lobbying from the Daughters of the Confederacy. The dean of the cathedral, the Very Rev. Gary Hall, stated that the Charleston church shooting was the catalyst for the planned removal, saying "It seemed to me that we couldn't, with credibility, address the race agenda if we were going to keep the windows in there."[170][171] On September 6, 2017, workmen were removing them.[172]
Trump rallies[edit]
Within a year of the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a counter-backlash to the removal of Confederate flags that the shooting inspired is playing out across the country, according to Politico.[173] The counter-backlash has extended to the national political scene as well. Confederate flags have been displayed at rallies supporting Donald Trump. A police officer, Michael Peters, resigned after being suspended for flying a Confederate flag from his pickup truck at a Nov. 11 "Love Trumps Hate" rally, three days after Trump’s presidential win.[174][175] Even though event organizers of rallies "...asks participants only to bring American flags to the rally, with no Confederate flags allowed.",[176] they continue to be seen at rallies.[177] On July 6, 2017, a Confederate battle flag was waved to greet President Trump upon his arrival in Poland for a brief visit before the G20 summit in Hamburg.[178]
While Trump expressed support for the removal of Confederate flags in 2015,[179] racists, anti-government radicals, and states’ rights activists who have led the battle charge for restoration of the rebel flag believed that he offered dog-whistling encouragement to them during his 2016 presidential campaign.[173]
Display in South Carolina vandalized[edit]
Three Sons of Confederate Veterans groups erected the flags of the United States, South Carolina, and the Confederacy June 16, 2018, on private land outside Holly Hill, South Carolina. A sign said the Sons of Confederate Veterans is honoring "All of Our Ancestors."
A newspaper report of June 21, 2018, said that graffiti that said "Move" and five dollar signs had been sprayed on the sign.
"Holly Hill Town Council asked the Confederate groups in April not to erect the display along U.S. 176. Mayor William Johnson said he was disappointed by the display."[180]

The Confederate flag's meaning in the 1960s was logical and historically consistent with its meaning in the 1860s, as a symbol of opposition to the employment of federal authority to change the south's racial status quo. There could be no more fitting opposition than the Confederate battle flag. Although segregationists lost their battle and their cause was discredited, attitudes of white supremacy live on.

TOPEKA, Kan. -- A bill getting consideration in the Kansas State House could protect individuals, businesses and groups in their discrimination against same-sex marriages and unions.
Supporters say the measure is about protecting bakeries, photographers and others from being punished for refusing for religious reasons to supply goods and services for same-sex weddings.
But opponents say the language of the bill extends beyond goods and services and could become a matter of life and death.
"I just can't even think where they're head is at on this. I mean we are all human beings," said Bruce Winter, a Board Member of LikeMe Lighthouse in Kansas City.
Johnson County Republican Charles Macheers first introduced the bill, now being considered in the Kansas Federal and State Affairs Committee
Supporters say it would protect those who refuse to recognize same-sex unions or provide benefits to gay couples for religious reasons. The thinking is that people should not have to compromise their religious beliefs because of a threat of legal action.
But local gay activists say using religion as a cover for hatred is not freedom.
"They're not making sense here. They are talking Christian values and all this, but it's not what a Christian value really is," Winter said.
Winter legally married his partner of more than 30 years in Iowa two years ago. He says proponents of the Kansas bill are just reacting to two federal court decisions which strike down bans on gay marriage.
"You're a productive citizen, you pay your taxes. You give back to the community. Who are you to judge anybody else. My lifestyle does not affect your lifestyle at all," said Winter.
Supporters say the bill is merely about religious freedom. The hearing on the bill continues on Wednesday. Both supporters and opponents say they expect the bill to be introduced on the house floor with little opposition.

Strong Economy Does Little to Lift Department Store Sales
NEW YORK (AP) – It was supposed to be a great year-end shopping season. Many investors had expected department stores to enjoy robust sales in light of a U.S. economy buoyed by low unemployment, higher wages, strong consumer confidence and cheap gas.
So when Macy’s and Kohl’s reported lackluster numbers on Thursday, they were taken aback, sending retail stocks into a tailspin and calling into question whether such mall-based chains can compete in a changing landscape where shoppers are shifting more of their spending online.
Macy’s saw only a slight increase of 1.1 percent in sales during November-December at stores opened at least year. And while sales were strong during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the company said sales fell off noticeably afterwards.
Meanwhile, Kohl’s reported a small sales growth that showed a dramatic slowdown from a year ago. Comparable sales rose 1.2 percent, versus 6.9 percent in the previous year.
U.S., China Leave Next Steps For Trade Talks Unclear
BEIJING (AP) – The United States and China gave no indication of their next step after wrapping up talks aimed at resolving a tariff fight that threatens to chill global growth.
The two sides will “maintain close contact,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said Thursday. But they announced no agreements or date for meeting again during the 90-day truce declared on Dec. 1 by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in their fight over Beijing’s technology ambitions.
That uncertainty dampened Asian investor sentiment. Stock markets in Germany, France, Japan and China fell back after rising Wednesday following Trump’s comment on Twitter that the talks were “going well!”
Negotiators focused on China’s pledge to buy a “substantial amount” of agricultural, energy, manufactured goods and other products and services, the U.S. Trade Representative said.

Final report on the causes of BP’s Macondo Well blowout
By John Wihbey
On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion killed 11 workers; the incident ultimately resulted in the release of some 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well deep below on the ocean floor. The size and scope of the event — and the 87 days that followed when neither the company, BP, nor the U.S. government, could plug the gushing well on the ocean floor — riveted the nation and drew significant attention to practices in the offshore oil drilling industry. In the aftermath, many officials pledged to investigate the root causes and establish whether or not industry practices needed to be changed.
In September 2011, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement issued a final assessment of the event, “Report Regarding the Causes of the April 20, 2010, Macondo Well Blowout,” which assesses responsibility for the explosion and concludes with a variety of technical recommendations to help improve safety in the industry.
The report’s main findings as they relate to culpability include:
“The failure of the rig crew to stop work on the Deepwater Horizon after encountering multiple hazards and warnings was a contributing cause of the Macondo blowout.”
“BP’s cost or time saving decisions without considering contingencies and mitigation were contributing causes of the Macondo blowout.”
“BP’s failure to ensure all risks associated with operations on the Deepwater Horizon were as low as reasonably practicable was a contributing cause of the Macondo blowout.”
“BP’s failure to have full supervision and accountability over the activities associated with the Deepwater Horizon was a contributing cause of the Macondo blowout.”
The investigators concluded that the spill was the “result of a series of decisions that increased risk and a number of actions that failed to fully consider or mitigate those risks. While it is not possible to discern which precise combination of these decisions and actions set the blowout in motion, it is clear that increased vigilance and awareness by BP, Transocean and Halliburton personnel at critical junctures during operations at the Macondo well would have reduced the likelihood of the blowout occurring.”

Won’t Somebody Please, Please Think of the Children?
March 2, 2009 by Mark Athitakis, posted in Marilynne Robinson	
D.G. Myers, who for my money runs one of the best new(ish) litblogs going, recently spent a little time with the question of whether American literature has something of a family problem—he argues that there’s a lack of fiction that addresses parenthood, especially motherhood. The problem, he suggests, may lie with the backgrounds of writers themselves, and to give something of a scientific imprimatur to his musings, he looks at the the authors featured in The Norton Anthology of American Literature (1914-1945) and discovers: “Forty-nine children born of thirty-seven writers—a child-to-writer ratio of 1.32, the fertility rate of a former Soviet Bloc country.”
One problem—heck, let’s call it sample bias—is immediately apparent. By drawing the line at 1945, Myers is neglecting writers who came into prominence after World War II, and might presumably have been having children during the largest burst of fertility in the country—the Baby Boom. John Updike had four children. John Cheever had three. Raymond Carver had two. Michael Chabon has four kids. Female authors? Louise Erdrich: three children by marriage, three by adoption. Marilynne Robinson had two children. Maxine Hong Kingston has one child, as does Alice Walker—though, famously in that case, mom and daughter don’t get along.
Of course, it’s best not to obsess too much over this: I’m being just as selective as Myers is, and there are plenty of childless authors in the postwar era (DeLillo, Roth, Cisneros, Welty, etc). And it wouldn’t change his central concern about “how very little of ordinary life—family life—gets into American writing.” There are plenty of families in American literature, he figures—they’re just a lot like the Snopes clan, or the Portnoy family.
Tolstoy’s riff on happy families comes in handy here—it may simply be that normal family life doesn’t make for interesting fiction, in the same way that the workplace rarely does. Though I’m happy that my family life in no way resembles, say, Russell Banks‘ Affliction, that doesn’t make me any less grateful for the book. Ordinary family life makes it into plenty of novels and stories, though that ordinariness can make critics skittish—the chief (and I think wrongheaded) complaint about Ha Jin‘s A Free Life was that it didn’t do much but cover relatively mundane domestic matters. The real trick is to cover those mundane bits of family life in a way that has depth and intelligence; the young mother in Kent Haruf’s Plainsong comes to mind, as does the aging father in Robinson’s Gilead. Whether or not this country has a “low-fertility-rate literature”, as Myers writes, the fact is it hasn’t neglected stories about families—it’s just that the wisest writers seem to know how sizable a task it is to write about them honestly and well.

Facebook Messenger Gets a Big Makeover
By Angela Moscaritolo
Oct. 24, 2018, 11:28 a.m.
Facebook has reduced the number of tabs inside the app from nine to just three: Chats, People, and Discover. Chats will house all your conversations, People is where you can check out friends' stories, and Discover is for connecting with businesses and playing Instant Games.
Change is hard, so brace yourself, Facebook Messenger users: an app overhaul is on the way.
Introduced Tuesday, Messenger 4, which is rolling out now and slated to reach all users over the coming weeks, is all about simplicity. To that end, Facebook has reduced the number of tabs inside the app from nine to just three: Chats, People, and Discover.
Chats will house all your one-on-one and group conversations, People is where you can check out friends' stories and see who's active, and Discover is for connecting with businesses and playing Instant Games.
SEE ALSO: The Best Helpdesk Software for 2019
Facebook Messenger Head Davis Marcus tipped this redesign in January, noting that the app had "become too cluttered."
Don't worry about losing your favorite Messenger features, though: Facebook said they're all staying put.
"Whether you want to poll your friends on which movie to see, split the bill for last night's dinner, share your live location to find friends at a music festival, challenge them to your favorite games, or catch up in a group video chat, we aren't changing anything about what you've always loved about Messenger," Messenger VP Stan Chudnovsky wrote in a blog post.
Meanwhile, one new feature in Messenger 4 lets you spice up your chat bubbles with custom color gradients, which you can see below.
"You can see the colors change from red to blue, for example, as you scroll up and down a conversation," Chudnovsky explained.
In the future, Facebook plans to introduce a Dark Mode for those who prefer a black background, and a "re-skinned interface that cuts down on the glare from your phone."
Here's hoping people like the new version of Messenger better than Shapchat's widely panned redesign earlier this year. Snapchat was forced to roll back elements of the overhaul after users revolted.

How to save the world with sustainable development

May 2, 2018
Moving away from the buzzwords with lessons we can take away from the coastal country of Portugal.
In 2015, the United Nations released a list of 17 comprehensive Sustainable Development Goals: “a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.” By 2030, the aim is to have achieved each of these goals.
Ambitious? Without a doubt — and much of the criticism lays in how over-arching the goals are with 169 targets encased across 17 goals. As The Economist puts it: “Moses brought ten commandments down from Mount Sinai. If only the UN’s proposed list of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were as concise.”
I was quite overwhelmed when I had first heard of the SDGs myself. I couldn’t fathom how the world was going to eradicate poverty, feed the population, achieve gender equality and more by 2030. Undoubtedly, this is why so many people feel disconnected from the SDGs. It’s hard to find them relevant at a local level when they seem so grand. However, as daunting as they are, examples of sustainable development are a lot less complex, much more familiar, and probably already in practice than one may expect to believe.
In mid-March, I had the opportunity to travel to Portugal to attend an Education for Sustainable Development Leadership training hosted by UNESCO, FEE, & ABAE. I was surrounded by students from all over the world— tiny European countries of Montenegro and Slovenia; industrialized Asian nations of China and Singapore; and Western countries such as Canada and the USA, just to name a few. We were brought together under the common theme of being young journalists passionate about bringing environmental issues to light.
The training proved just how difficult sustainable development is on a global scale when there are so many diverse perspectives in the room. I came out of the training with a better understanding of what it means and saw it as more of a spectrum rather than a solid definition.
Being in Portugal gave us the common ground to see real-life examples of how its municipalities define sustainable development.
Sustainable development uses existing resources and expertise with the foresight of what role it will play in the future.
Costa da Caparica is a city bordered to by the sea. It hosts an impressive 15km of shoreline, making it a prime destination for nearly 8 million tourists every summer. However, residents are under the constant threat of coastal erosion, which is the entry of coastal waters from the beach and into town.
Thankfully, nature is a powerful form of defence in the tug-of-war between the land and the ocean. Sand dunes prevent damage in the city by absorbing the impacts of strong winds and rains of tropical storms.
The recent unpredictability of Portugal’s weather brings a need to be proactive towards extreme weather, rather than reactive. With 39 deaths from last year’s forest fires and an unexpected storm a week before our arrival, more attention is brought to mitigation rather than adaptation to extreme weather events and climate change.
Here enters Dr. Patricia Silva — a botanist working for the Municipality of Almada. After analyzing past records, she discovered that the beach had already retreated about 14m inwards towards the town as a result of extreme coastal erosion which had worn away the sand dunes. She began Projeto Reduna in an effort to reinforce the dunes.

She knew that marram grass, a native species of beachgrass, was suitable for this project. Its roots grow up to 7 ft long, effectively rooting sand in its place to prevent erosion. By planting marram grass with other native species and supplementing the sand that had eroded away, the sand dunes became resilient to the increasingly frequent storms.

To prevent human disturbance of the sand dunes, local residents were consulted to map out pathways along the beach and around the dunes. Signs were placed to educate the public on the importance of sand dunes and why it was key not to disturb them.
Instead of introducing foreign objects and doing construction work on the beach, Projeto Reduna successfully rebuilt the dunes with minimal invasion and ensured the presence of biodiversity for generations to come.
Sustainable development isn’t limited to a specific demographic — it‘s accessible for all people.
The city of Costa de Caparica is peri-urban and transient with local residents usually shuttling to and from Lisbon for work. But on a patch of land situated between two neighbourhoods is a growing economy of kale, carrots, and cauliflower among other vegetables tended to by residents.

Almada’s community food gardens are a buzzing local ecosystem of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Each participant receives about 50m² of land and takes a course in basic agricultural practices to learn how to care for their plot of land. They learn how to grow produce and make compost using household and local businesses’ food waste.
“It’s an experiment!” Dr. Silva picks through 4 month old compost and holds a spoon, labelled as ‘compostable’. Photo credit: Kai Xiang (Singapore)
By growing, trading, and selling their own produce, residents save money and create resilient, sustainable, local markets. They often prefer their own crops to what they see at the supermarkets, knowing their produce was grown by their own hands, without the use of pesticides.
Socially, community gardens are a unique place for community members of all ages and backgrounds to meet. Groups which may not have interacted otherwise inevitably find something in common to talk about: “ the men, the women, the rich and the poor are all attacked by the same plagues — birds, pests, animals,” says Dr. Silva.
“The priority is to make communities healthier and resilient so that when something happens, people know each other and trust each other.”
Photo credit: Kristina Madsen, Federation for Environmental Education (Denmark)
A hybrid of tradition, innovation, and creativity prove to be successful solutions to development issues. In this case, it’s looking at existing methods that have worked for thousands of years and supplementing them to be effective in the 21st century with a growing population.

Everyone’s Journey is Different……
My cousin Randy and I have always been close. Four years my junior, we have always been likeminded. No one could have predicted that our fathers’ illnesses–similar yet so different–would bring us even closer.
Both our dads’ names were Howard. I’ve told my Howard’s story in this blog for a number of years. I miss him and try to honor him each and every day.
As we approach the first anniversary of Howard’s passing, here’s Randy’s Howard’s story as told Randy.
Love you cuz. You’re a mensch.
My dad passed away a year ago suffering from dementia. I started writing this article shortly after his passing to share my concern about what I perceived was the lack of respect and dignity shown to my father during his illness. With time and reflection, it became more about his journey and ours, which included the search for empathy, respect and dignity.
My father was diagnosed several years ago. With that diagnosis, we knew his journey through life would change. I knew my journey with him, my mother’s and his wife of 54 years, and the journey of his family and friends would change also. What I didn’t know at the time was how much and at what rate it would change. Given my role in the pharmaceutical industry and some personal experience, I was very aware that current medical treatments may slow the progression of the disease, but not stop or prevent it. Let’s make no mistakes here, there was no going back.
My mother had her own limitations and her ability to be his primary caretaker or the one to manage his care was in doubt by my family. On top of that, she had a huge case of denial. Given this denial, as well as proximity to my parents, the responsibility of caretaker fell to my sister. She was his saint and ours.
Each patient’s journey is different. For my dad, he was very much aware of what was happening to him right up his passing. Through it all, he expressed disbelief, frustration, embarrassment over the fuss, and concern over my mother’s care in the future. I often wished he would simply forget who he was or simply go back to another time period in his life, so as not to torture himself with how this happened and how this would end.
For him, it started with not finding the right words when he was speaking. Occasionally he would lose his balance which resulted in a fall. The same was true for mom, though there was no confirming diagnosis for her. Aware of his condition, and despite’s my mom’s denial and her ability to be the “navigator” while he was driving, he gave it up when we urged him to do so. He was acknowledging the change that was taking place. When we brought up the idea of assisted living and/or memory care, dad was agreeable, but mom didn’t want to hear this at all and thus it didn’t happen. This denial continued as they both started to lose their balance and fall more frequently. There was also incontinence. He stopped playing cards with the neighbors as he was having trouble remembering. A neighbor later told me that they knew what was happening and they looked the other way. Not always easy for senior citizens engaged in a game. Last fall, we noticed the rate of his decline started to pick up. It presented as more frequent falls, battles with depression, eating less, perhaps as a result of having trouble with the utensils, and not finding the right words and/or recalling memories when we had our daily chats. He was becoming increasingly irritable with my mom (some deserving, some undeserving, I am sure). He began to withdraw from conversations, partly because he couldn’t hear well, despite having a hearing aid, but I think mostly because he was embarrassed that he couldn’t follow. When we were together for family gatherings, I would look across the table and we would smile at each other. It was a look we had been exchanging for many years. The look you give someone when you are thinking the same way. In this case, he knew that I knew he had no idea what was going on. It became another way to acknowledge the change that was occurring. I will always remember that look fondly. Make no mistake, dad was not improving.
Around New Years of 2017, Dad fell and developed rhabdomylesosis (rhabdo). Over the course of several days the doctor’s successfully resolved the rhabdo. There were no obvious signs of a stroke. While in the hospital, his conditioned seemed to worsen, and our options for how he was going to live his life suddenly shrank. Immediately after the fall he tried to grab things in mid-air. It was like he was trying to grab little floaters he was seeing with his fingers. I had never seen this and certainly was not like anything he did when I saw him a week or two prior to the fall. His ability to speak was also impaired. I had spoken to him the day before the fall and the difference was nothing less than shocking. After a few days, when he was clinically stable, it was agreed that he should be moved to a rehab facility to gain some strength and work on his stability. At the same time, we were told that with each move, it will be unsettling and may have a negative impact on him. He moved to a facility that my parents had been driving by over the years and was on the list of places they said they would consider when the time was right.
Moving to this first facility, however brief, was really my first introduction to elder care outside a few visits to an assisted living or nursing facility. I was never quite sure if the wing dad was in was a nursing home or a rehab but regardless, after a few visits, I made two major observations. First, the number of visitors to see other patients/residents was shockingly low. I wondered why, but deep down, I knew the answer and it made me sad. Second, it was no hospital, meaning with the exception of changing linen, giving medicines, moving to another room for a change of scenery, or some group activity which he had was not able to do, he was alone when we weren’t there. We watched his behavior change, becoming more agitated. Days later we learned that the agitation, and yes, some aggressive behavior, was due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). The doctor was able to resolve the UTI within 7-10 days, but the damage was done, the agitation and aggressive behavior became part of his medical record. The staff tried on a few occasions to do physical therapy, but he became agitated. That said, the chance of success was low because they would often come at 4:30, right before dinner, and when “sun-downing” was starting. Outside of physical therapy, he kept trying to stand and walk by himself despite his ability to support himself was declining. Sometimes we couldn’t really understand what dad was saying; sometimes he was talking about another time in his life.
Despite having all the legal paperwork in order, communication with both the administrative staff as well as the nursing/caretaker staff was mediocre at best. Rarely did a caretaker come into his room to check on him or try to understand what he was trying to communicate. We asked several times if the physical therapy time could be changed, with no response. There was an occasional nurse who would sit and talk with us as she saw we were looking to understand what was going on. Interest in caring and responding to his needs seemed to wane. I get it, it’s not a hospital, and the ratio of caretakers to residents may limit their ability to be more attentive, but he did deserve to be treated in a way that was respectful and dignified. This was not the proud, soft-spoken, humble, family man we knew, but it was the only side the caretakers knew. I kept hoping a caretaker would stop to ask what kind of man he was. They had to know he was loved, as there were few other people visiting this wing of the facility. Just as important, as my dad, our family expected and deserved regular communication when changes were observed or treatment changed.
As it became clear that he wasn’t going to get the proper level of care at this facility, we began to seek out alternatives. At the same time, we were told he would have to move as soon as possible. The administrative office made it sound like a space or financial issue, though we had a sound financial plan in place. Quickly we reached information overload and it resulted in analysis paralysis. Identifying the right facility and one that would take him based on his condition was difficult. We learned that it would be difficult to move him across state lines due to challenges with Medicaid rules; we learned that it didn’t matter whether or not a UTI caused the agitation and aggressiveness, it was just that, agitation and aggressiveness. To help navigate the maize of options, challenges, and legal questions we hired a lawyer as well as a company that specializes in helping families navigate through elder care and advocate on their behalf. Yes, it cost money but there was no other way. We needed to ensure that right decisions were made and frankly know when and how to push back on administrators and caretakers. My dad would have to get evaluated, his medical records reviewed by a representative of the facility and the facility would then decide whether or not it could provide the level of care needed. This being new to me, I likened it to tryouts for a sports team or an audition for a stage show. We found ourselves praying he would pass the tryout/audition. Unfortunately, many doors closed, and our options kept shrinking. He was moved to a second facility, battled another UTI, which seemed to present itself in the same way it did before. It was apparent that this facility couldn’t and wouldn’t provide the care needed for him as he continued to decline. The decline continued with him loosing muscle control, losing weight, incontinence, speech impediments, periods of delirium, and depression.
This led to the third facility; he was accepted there, with the condition that to ensure he needs were met and that his behavior was in check, he would get 24×7 private aides. Over time, to manage costs, the hours could be reduced. We hired a nursing agency and saw a revolving door of aides to cover all those hours. There was one aide that he had a connection with but we were not able to have him scheduled more with dad. Some, not feeling comfortable, never came back. With the private aides in place, the caretakers from the new facility absolved themselves of the need to partner with the agency aides to support his needs. During visits you could see the tension between the aides. When that happens the only one to lose is the patient. The administrators were in agreement, but it never seemed to reach the caregivers on staff. My sister worked to improve this on a daily basis, in-person, and on the phone, with no luck at all. The same was true with our advocate. Over a period of two months, the facility became comfortable with my father, and we began to reduce the hours of the private aides. As concern grew that without the aides, his care declined, I walked into what can only be described as a hurricane. There was “stuff” laying all around; old linen, towels, clothes, old food and drinks, no doubt from the aides; whether it was from the private or facility, it didn’t really matter to me. Then I turned to my dad, laying in a fetal position on the bed with a diaper. I was speechless and motionless; I tried to hold my tears in, as my mom was with me, but the shock was too much. I eventually collected myself and went to the nurse’s station, where I got a response that was almost non-responsive. I immediately went back to the room, took a breath to get over my shock, and began to straighten out the room. The private aide arrived and helped clean him up. I wanted to take pictures to share with the administrators, but frankly it was a horror show and I didn’t want to see it. My sister was once again left to complain. To the caregivers, all I could think was, “What is wrong with you people? Does anyone deserve this? Would you treat your family in this way? Doesn’t everyone deserve to die with dignity”?
Throughout this time my mom had been living at home. Prior to the fall, I could probably count on two hands the number of nights they slept in separate beds. While my dad was in the hospital, she agreed to have an aide come into her house a few hours a day/ 5 days a week to help with cooking, cleaning, and in her words, “to have a companion”. By that time, she had lost contact with many friends or simply had little to say, she stopped driving, and wasn’t interacting with the outside world much. The TV news became her friend. At our urging she started to use a walker and really felt better about getting around the house. Seems silly, but we all wanted to celebrate this moment. She kept on thinking Dad was coming home; while we knew differently. On Memorial Day, we moved her to an assisted living facility, where she got involved in many activities to keep herself busy. She didn’t have to make her meals, clean the dishes, and wash her clothes. The location was chosen as it was close to my dad’s facility and they would be able to drive her there twice a week to sit with my dad. Quickly she saw that dad was sleeping much of the day, his appetite was decreasing by the day. Her husband, our dad, was slipping away.
Throughout this journey my sister was getting drained. The downs, were outweighing the ups. What she wanted, what we all wanted, was for him to stabilize and be comfortable? My sister and her family were constantly in motion….Where are his glasses? Where are the hearing aids? Do the batteries work? Where is all his laundry? Why are there no clothes? Maybe he will eat a hamburger (it became one of his favorites as we neared the end)? Will the aides show up? Do I have time to pay their bills? As you could imagine, there were many more questions. As my brother and I watched from a distance, I helped by organizing and paying bills. Except for helping out on an occasional visit and being a listener (sometimes good, sometimes not so much), that was all I could do. While getting access to all the necessary accounts was frustrating, it was mostly busy work. Compared to what my sister was managing, it was a walk in the park on a sunny day.
About a month after my mom’s move, my sister and our advocate pulled off what can only be described as a blessing. The assisted living facility where my mom moved to, agreed to accept my dad to the facility, three doors down from my mom. We agreed to 24×7 aides we started him on hospice care. After about two weeks, the hospice nurse indicated that the family should gather quickly as the end was near. We spent several hours with him on Thursday and Friday. I was so happy that we found a peaceful place for him to stay, near mom, with people who treated him with dignity and respect, in the absence of chaos in the hallways, surrounded by some of his belongings and pictures of everyone he loved. He was on medication to make him comfortable and on Thursday, he had just enough strength to share that twinkle in his face. He shared it with everyone in the room. While it made me sad, that twinkle we shared was worth a million dollars. On Saturday morning, the hospice nurse suggested that we share some last words, and tell him that everyone had come to see him, then let him leave us when he was ready. It hit me profoundly that I wasn’t there to see him take his last breath, I was there to say goodbye to my father, my biggest fan, and my hero. As Saturday progressed, we did just that, over the course of several hours, family said goodbye to him and left the room, with my mom being the last one to leave around 8:30. Several hours later he passed peacefully.
It was a long eight months for the family. It must have felt like an eternity for my sister and her family. Throughout that period, I made sure to tell my dad how much I loved him. I told my sister and her family how grateful we all were to her and her family and that we knew how hard she was working to make dad comfortable. I also told her several times during the final two weeks that in the end, he passed in peace and we owed it all to her. Now, as we mourn the loss of dad, our attention will turn to our mom, just like dad would have wanted it.
Over the next decade or so, our society is going to be faced with a tremendous crisis. The numbers of patients with dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other complex diseases in which there is no treatment will increase. We need better care, including compassionate healthcare workers. We need to address this problem even though resources will be limited and costs will increase.
Remember, it’s the disease causing these behaviors and not how the patient was or wants to be seen. My father and everyone on the journey towards end of life should be treated with dignity and respect as their time here ends.

About Me
I am the 50+-ish only son an elderly mother who live 1,500 miles away in an assisted living facility.
I visit her every three to four weeks, having lost my dad in March 2013 after three years of escalating health issues, moving them out of their house, declaring bankruptcy on their behalf and countless phone calls and health scares.
I wake up each day and go to sleep each night thinking about my mom and worrying about her well being, health and safety.
I know there are millions of people like me.
Mom is a 78-year-old Type 1 brittle diabetic, having been diagnosed when she was 11. You don't meet many of them because they don't exist. She was not supposed to live into her 50s, and continues to defy the odds. 9 months ago, she was told she'd never walk again. After her 6th back surgery, she is walking with a walker.
Dad was 81 and had Alzheimer's. He had multiple health issues, was in and out of rehab. It was his time, and he was ready. I am at peace.
My younger sister lives 5 miles from my mom, sees her occasionally, and has her own demons to fight. She does the best she can, I have realized, after spending way too much time and energy being angry with her.
My parents are MY responsibility.
I hope that by starting this blog, relating my experiences, and sharing others' we will all learn something about the care of our aging parents.
For the privacy of my family, I remain anonymous to most.
Let's help each other help them.

Begun living with the worker before the grandchild became 18 years old; and
Lived with the worker in the U.S. and received at least one-half support from the worker:
For the year before the month the worker became entitled to retirement or disability insurance benefits or died; or

Weekly Art Challenge: Crosshatching 3
The object of the exercise:
In the second crosshatching challenge I followed a YouTube tutorial video that showed how to crosshatch an arm. I was quite pleased with the results but it involved following very closely the lines drawn by the tutor. The next stage was to try working out, on my own, where the cross hatching lines should go and what they should look like.
There’s more to what they should look like than your at first realise.
How long should they be?
Should the lines be curved and if so how and where?
How spaced should they be?
How should the thickness vary?
Should there be stippling?
The challenge
So now the challenge is to crosshatch an image from scratch. From previous experience (the first crosshatching challenge) I decided the human face was too challenging for me just yet, so I decided to have a go at my hand, or more precisely the back of my hand with it flat on the table.
The method
I first drew around my hand on a large piece of paper. Next I drew in the nails and drew in the creases on the joints in the fingers. Then I got stuck in trying to convey the shaded areas with cross hatching.
My efforts
It is harder than it looks!
The fingers weren’t too bad, they’re like uneven cylinders, but I made a real mess of the backs of the hands, the shading is a lot more subtle and less obvious. I went in far too heavily and then tried to erase my bad lines with a white gel pen which gave a stippled sort of effect and looked a bit like patchy hair!
What I learned
I quite like the effect of the shading on the sides of the fingers as, by chance, the length of the hatching lines where uneven, but that’s right, fingers aren’t perfectly uniform cylinders.
Lighting: I started drawing by a window in late afternoon and it took longer than I expected so I was using natural lighting but the nature and strength of that lighting changed over the course of the exercise. That made it more difficult! Especially with the more subtle areas like the back of the hand. So next time maybe start earlier of use artificial lighting.

First AIDS Patient Cured With Leukemia Treament
Stem Cell Transplant Cures HIV In 'Berlin Patient'
On the heels of World AIDS Day comes a stunning medical breakthrough: Doctors believe an HIV-positive man who underwent a stem cell transplant has been cured as a result of the procedure.
Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the "Berlin Patient," received the transplant in 2007 as part of a lengthy treatment course for leukemia. His doctors recently published a report in the journal Blood affirming that the results of extensive testing "strongly suggest that cure of HIV infection has been achieved."
Brown's case paves a path for constructing a permanent cure for HIV through genetically-engineered stem cells.

Spice/K2 ~ The latest dangerous drug out to get our kids
I've never heard of "Spice" till my daughter asked me about it today. She said it's something people smoke and everybody is talking about it. I told her I've heard about "Liquid Cocaine", but "Spice"....no.
So naturally I had to Google it to satisfy my curiosity and found loads of information on it, mostly warning people for its dangerous effects and its growing popularity among teenagers.
I thought I better pass this on to help raise awareness on this harmful, but legal substance that's widely available to everyone, regardless of age.
Spice - K2 -New Drug - Drug Rehab Update on Smokable Synthetic Marijuana
Spice Alert
We wanted to alert you to a new substance that has surfaced in our area. Spice is a herbal substance that gives a “cannabis-like” effect when smoked. The Sober Living by the Sea Community, as well as treatment centers across the Nation, are facing this new epidemic of Spice use head on, and we are all working to increase awareness for ourselves, our population and our families. We continue to research remedies, both in the medical community and though educational resources. We wanted to take this opportunity to make you aware of the existence of this new substance as you may hear about it from your loved one. We would ask for your cooperation in our efforts to combat this now legal substance. We are hoping that by providing the following information that you will have the knowledge you may need if your loved one broaches the subject in a conversation.
The smoking mixture, known as Spice, is sold nationwide in shops that specialize in the sale of drug paraphernalia, also known as “head shops”. It looks, and smells, much like potpourri, so it is difficult to detect. Many users of this substance are concealing it by rolling it into cigarettes, or putting a bit into a wad of chewing gum.

Muslim lady lost her job for demonstrating proper use of condom while dressed in hijab
Please support Milouda!
There is no reason she should lose her job or be threatened and harassed simply for performing a necessary public service.
She was merely doing her job educating the public and raising awareness to combat the spread of AIDS, while working for an anti-AIDS nonprofit organization in a country that has 25,000 recorded cases of AIDS infected patients.
Now she's being harassed and threatened for causing embarrassment to the Muslim community, after she was shown on French TV educating Moroccan youth and prostitutes at an anti-Aids conference on how to apply a subtle technique to use a condom, especially when a sex partner refuses to use protection.
The spread of AIDS continues to be a global menace that affects us all!
Milouda should be hailed as a brave and courageous woman for going all out to raise awareness on a serious public threat and should NOT be ostracized for doing her job.
Clearly her intentions are good and not meant to cause harm or embarrassment to anyone.
Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.
Support Milouda, Sign petition here
`````````````````````````````````
I just translated the first half of the Dutch article I linked to above (starting with the title), which I think is most relevant to Milouda's case.
Also...it is not clear from this article if Milouda was fired or simply quit her job out of embarrassment or as a result of being threatened and harassed.
.........
Little trick with a condom cost Moroccan woman her career
RABAT - Milouda can be seen only briefly on the Internet. "But those ten seconds, have ruined my entire career," she says. Milouda is a Moroccan woman with a headscarf shown on a clip via Youtube, demonstrating how to put a condom on a penis with your mouth . She is being threatened ever since.
Her aim was so praiseworthy. In the fight against AIDS, she wants to get prostitutes and young, inexperienced girls acquainted with the condom. Milouda worked at Doctors Without Borders for ten years she says on Tuesday on the Moroccan newspaper Akhbar Alyoum, and since 2007 she is working for the ALCS, a Moroccan anti-AIDS organization.
In late March the ALCS organized a conference on HIV and AIDS in Casablanca. In response, the French news agency AFP made a movie about HIV and AIDS in Morocco, which was broadcast on French television. Afterwards, the clip ended up on Youtube.
It's a neat movie. Himmich Hakima, president of the ALCS, explains that in Morocco around 25 thousand people are HIV positive. An HIV patient says that no one dares to talk about her illness and we hear that condoms are not popular in Morocco.
The movie also shows what ALCS does in terms of AIDS prevention. One of the actions is a weekly briefing for prostitutes - and the camera zooms in on the educator, a woman with a black head scarf in the back with a condom. That woman is Milouda.
Milouda explains how a prostitute can handle customers who do not want the condom. "If the customer does not want to, tell him that you have something new," says Milouda. "He will enjoy it." Milouda then crumpled the condom in her mouth and let it slide down on one of the colored fake penises in front of her on the table.
[I think this is the part that's most telling]
Morocco's conservative Islamic party PJD said it was a disgrace. Sex education, fine, but this woman went into too much detail. She didn't need to say how men like to be satisfied. Even chief editor Rachid Niny of Al Massae, who is known as enlightened, thought this was a no no. The combination scarf and condoms, that was what most critics found repugnant.

At least 400 ISIL fighters are specially trained and ready to attack Europe: officials

PARIS — The Islamic State group has trained at least 400 fighters to target Europe in deadly waves of attacks, deploying interlocking terror cells like the ones that struck Brussels and Paris with orders to choose the time, place and method for maximum chaos, officials have told The Associated Press.
The network of agile and semiautonomous cells shows the reach of the extremist group in Europe even as it loses ground in Syria and Iraq.
The officials, including European and Iraqi intelligence officials and a French lawmaker who follows the jihadi networks, described camps in Syria, Iraq and possibly the former Soviet bloc where attackers are trained to target the West. Before being killed in a police raid, the ringleader of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks claimed he had entered Europe in a multinational group of 90 fighters, who scattered “more or less everywhere.”
Belgium Federal Police via AP
But the biggest break yet in the Paris attacks investigation — the arrest on Friday of fugitive Salah Abdeslam — did not thwart the multipronged attack just four days later on the Belgian capital’s airport and subway system that left 31 people dead and an estimated 270 wounded. Three suicide bombers also died.
Just as in Paris, Belgian authorities were searching for at least one fugitive in Tuesday’s attacks — this time for a man wearing a white jacket who was seen on airport security footage with the two suicide attackers. The fear is that the man, whose identity Belgian officials say is not known, will follow Abdeslam’s path.
After fleeing Paris immediately after the November attacks, Abdeslam forged a new network back in his childhood neighborhood of Molenbeek, long known as a haven for jihadis, and renewed plotting, according to Belgian officials.
“Not only did he drop out of sight, but he did so to organize another attack, with accomplices everywhere. With suicide belts. Two attacks organized just like in Paris. And his arrest, since they knew he was going to talk, it was a response: ‘So what if he was arrested? We’ll show you that it doesn’t change a thing,’” said French Senator Nathalie Goulet, co-head of a commission tracking jihadi networks.
Estimates range from 400 to 600 Islamic State fighters trained specifically for external attacks, according to the officials, including Goulet. Some 5,000 Europeans have gone to Syria.
“The reality is that if we knew exactly how many there were, it wouldn’t be happening,” she said.
More than four sources with access to tallies of fighters tasked with Europe attacks independently corroborated the numbers of fighters who trained for specific attacks in Europe, including some who have spoken to fighters directly. Others have cross checked information regarding fighters leaving or returning.
Two of the suicide bombers in Tuesday’s attacks, Belgian-born brothers Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui, were known to authorities as common criminals, not anti-Western radicals until an apartment one of them rented was traced to Abdeslam last week, according to Belgian state broadcaster RTBF. Similarly, an Algerian killed inside that apartment on March 15 had nothing but a petty theft record in Sweden — but he’d signed up as an Islamic State suicide bomber for the group in 2014 and returned to Europe as part of the Nov. 13 plot.
In claiming responsibility for Tuesday’s attack, the Islamic State group described a “secret cell of soldiers” dispatched to Brussels for the purpose. The shadowy cells were confirmed by the EU police agency, Europol, which said in a late January report that intelligence officials believed the group had “developed an external action command trained for special forces-style attacks.”
French speakers with links to North Africa, France and Belgium appear to be leading the units and are responsible for developing attack strategies in Europe, said a European security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss briefing material. He is also familiar with interrogations of former fighters who have returned to Europe. Some were jailed after leaving ISIL while others were kicked out of the terror group, and they include Muslims and Muslim converts from all across Europe.

Fighters in the units are trained in battleground strategies, explosives, surveillance techniques and counter surveillance, the security official said.
“The difference is that in 2014, some of these IS fighters were only being given a couple weeks of training,” he said. “Now the strategy has changed. Special units have been set up. The training is longer. And the objective appears to no longer be killing as many people as possible but rather to have as many terror operations as possible, so the enemy is forced to spend more money or more in manpower.”
Similar methods had been developed by al-Qaida but ISIL has taken it to a new level, he said. Another difference is that fighters are being trained to be their own operators — not necessarily to be beholden to orders from the ISIL stronghold in Raqqa, Syria, or elsewhere.
Several security officials have said there is growing evidence to suggest the bulk of the training is taking place in Syria, Libya and elsewhere in North Africa.
In the case of Tuesday’s attacks, Abdeslam’s arrest may have been a trigger for a plot that was already far along.
“To pull off an attack of this sophistication, you need training, planning, materials and a landscape,” said Shiraz Maher, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College in London, which has one of the largest databases of fighters and their networks.
“Even if they worked flat out, the attackers in Brussels would have needed at least four days,” said Maher, who has conducted extensive interviews with foreign fighters.
The question for many intelligence and security officials is now turning to just how many more fighters have been trained and are ready for more attacks.
A senior Iraqi intelligence official who was not authorized to speak publicly said people from the cell that carried out the Paris attacks are scattered across Germany, Britain, Italy, Denmark and Sweden. Recently, a new group crossed in from Turkey, the official said.
The training is longer. And the objective appears to no longer be killing as many people as possible but rather to have as many terror operations as possible.
On Wednesday, Turkish authorities said one of the Brussels suicide attackers, Ibrahim El Bakraoui, was caught last June near the Syrian border and deported to the Netherlands, with Ankara warning Dutch and Belgian officials that he was a “foreign terrorist fighter.” But he was released from Dutch custody due to lack of evidence of involvement in extremism.
Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens said Wednesday that authorities had no reason to detain El Bakraoui because he was “not known for terrorist acts but as a common law criminal who was on conditional release.”
The latest new name to surface this week, Najim Laachraoui, turned out to be the bombmaker who made the suicide vests used in the Paris attacks, according to French and Belgian officials. Attackers used an explosive known as Triacetone Triperoxide, or TATP, made from common household chemicals. DNA evidence indicates he died on Tuesday in the suicide attack on the airport, two officials briefed on the investigation told AP.
Fifteen kilos of TATP were found in an apartment linked to the Brussels attackers, along with other explosive material.
The unidentified man seen on security footage wearing a white jacket and black hat at the Brussels airport on Tuesday remains at large, a fugitive link in a chain still being forged.

“The police quickly came to the scene and found two seriously injured people inside an apartment.One person was declared dead very quickly, the other was driven to St. Olaf’s hospital, but immediately afterwards was notified to be dead stated Anders Sunde Eidem, head of the joint unit for investigation in Trøndelag police district, at a press conference late on Monday evening.
All the people involved are men in their late teens and of foreign origin.The last of the three who were exposed to the violence was aware of the incident and referred to as being less seriously injured.

ObamaCare White House Report December 2016
Written by ObamaCareFacts.com in ObamaCare News Archive
Published - December 19, 2016
Last Updated - August 15, 2018

Is ObamaCare Working?
The White House just released a 100-page report on ObamaCare (the Affordable Care Act). Below are some key facts and the full report.
By most measures, according to the report, ObamaCare is working.
In other words, in many respects, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is living up to its name by ensuring affordable care via perks like tax credits, ensuring expanded access to coverage via improvements to programs like Medicaid, and ensuring key patient protections like the protections from preexisting condition-based exclusions.
This isn’t to say ObamaCare is perfect, it is simply to say there is a lot that is working, and that is what the report covers and what we highlight below.
READ: More technically, on December 13th, 2016 the Council of Economic Advisers released THE ECONOMIC RECORD OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: REFORMING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (the full report in PDF form), an accompanying chart book, and a summary. Below we present some highlights from the report and the summary. Also, vitally, we are archiving this for future use so people can find it when they search for things like “100-page White House Report on ObamaCare that shows it is working” and such. Learn more here In glowing report, White House says Obamacare is saving lives.
TIP: All facts below are citable via the above report and are backed up on our website. Feel free to ask questions or comment below.
Facts That Show ObamaCare is Working
The introduction to the report covers the basics. The report itself covers the detail. Here are some highlights from the introduction to the report.
In 2008, the year before the Obama Administration began, more than one-in-seven Americans—44 million people—lacked health insurance coverage. Many uninsured individuals were simply unable to afford coverage, while many others were locked out or priced out of the individual health insurance market because they had preexisting health conditions. Their lack of insurance coverage kept them from being able to obtain the care they needed and left them vulnerable to financial catastrophe if they became seriously ill. Meanwhile, even many Americans with health insurance faced significant risks due to significant gaps in their coverage.
Because of the coverage provisions of the ACA, an estimated 20 million additional adults now have health insurance. Also, thanks in large part to the ACA and the improvements to CHIP that the President signed into law, the uninsured rate among children has fallen by almost half since the President took office, providing health insurance to more than 3 million additional children. Following these gains, the uninsured rate stands below 9 percent for the first time.
Nationwide, uncompensated care has fallen by more than a quarter as a share of hospital operating costs from 2013 to 2015, corresponding to a cost reduction of $10.4 billion. Early evidence also suggests that expanded coverage is driving improvements in health that are consistent with we saw in prior research; if experience under the ACA matches what was observed under Massachusetts health reform, we are avoiding an estimated 24,000 deaths annually. Looking beyond the health care sector, the ACA has also sharply reduced medical outcomes due to income inequality, and it has achieved this broad range of benefits without the adverse near-term effects on the labor market that the ACA’s critics predicted, while also helping to lay the foundation for a stronger labor market over the long term.
Due to the spread of out-of-pocket limits since 2010, an estimated 22 million additional people enrolled in employer-sponsored plans are protected against catastrophic costs in 2016. Similarly, because of the ACA’s provision phasing out the Medicare Part D coverage gap, more than 11 million Medicare beneficiaries have received cumulative savings on prescription drugs averaging more than $2,100 a person as of the middle of 2016.
ACOs and APMs (accountable care organizations and alternative payment methods) have both shown early signs of success. Using the tools provided by the ACA, the Administration has made considerable progress in deploying APMs, including accountable care, bundled payment, and medical home models. As of early 2016, more than 30 percent of traditional Medicare payments were estimated to be associated with APMs, up from virtually none in 2010. The tools provided by the ACA, which were enhanced by the bipartisan physician payment reform legislation enacted in 2015, will drive further progress in the years ahead.
The six years since the ACA became law have seen very encouraging trends in both health care costs and health care quality. Prices of health care goods and services have grown at a slower rate under the ACA than during any period of the same length since these data began in 1959. Recent years have also seen exceptionally slow growth in per-enrollee spending in both public programs and private insurance. In parallel, there have been promising indications that quality of care is improving. The rate at which patients are harmed while seeking hospital care has fallen by 21 percent since 2010, which is estimated to have led to approximately 125,000 avoided deaths cumulatively through 2015. Medicare beneficiaries’ risk of returning to the hospital soon after discharge has also declined substantially, corresponding to an estimated 565,000 avoided readmissions from April 2010 through May 2015.
The average premium for people who hold employer-based family coverage was nearly $3,600 lower in 2016 than if premium growth since the ACA became law had matched the preceding decade. These are savings families will receive directly in the form of lower premium costs and indirectly in the form of higher wages. Far from offsetting the slowdown in premium growth, growth in out-of-pocket costs has slowed as well, and accounting for out-of- pocket costs increases these savings to $4,400 in 2016.
The typical Medicare beneficiary enrolled in traditional Medicare will incur around $700 less in premiums and cost sharing in 2016 than if Medicare spending trends had matched those projected in 2009. This figure does not include reductions in cost sharing on prescription drugs due to the combination of the ACA’s provision closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap and slower-than-expected growth in prescription drug spending, so it understates the total savings to Medicare beneficiaries.
Because State and Federal governments finance a substantial share of health care spending, slower growth in health care costs has also greatly improved the fiscal outlook. Due in large part to the ACA’s provisions slowing the growth of health care costs, CBO projects that the law will reduce deficits by increasing amounts in the years ahead, rising to an average of 1 percent of GDP over the decade starting in 2026. Over the next two decades as a whole, the law is projected to reduce deficits by more than $3 trillion. In addition, since just after the ACA became law, CBO has reduced its projections of Medicare spending under current policies by an additional $125 billion in 2020 or around 0.6 percent of GDP in that year, further improving the fiscal outlook. The combination of the ACA and broader trends in the health care sector have also added 11 years to the life of the Medicare Trust Fund to 2009 projections.
TIP: The report is very detailed and hard to summarize as it is a fact-based summary. We will add to this page over time. I strongly suggest reading the report yourself. There is probably no better way to learn about the Affordable Care Act. For those who don’t want to read the full report, I suggest the following reprint of a summary found on Whitehouse.gov (reprinted here without permission, for educational purposes only).
TEN NEW PIECES OF ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTING PROGRESS IN REFORMING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (Source: The Economic Record of the Obama Administration: Reforming The Health Care System).
1. The uninsured rate has declined in all income groups since 2013, demonstrating that the ACA’s reforms are working in concert to increase insurance coverage. The percentage decline in the uninsured rate since 2013 has been similar in all income groups, showing that the ACA’s reforms have been effective in reaching the uninsured at all income levels. Below 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), coverage gains have been driven primarily by Medicaid expansion. Coverage gains at higher income levels reflect the ACA’s interlocking reforms to the individual health insurance market: banning discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, providing financial assistance to make coverage affordable, and implementing an individual responsibility provision. In particular, the 31 percent decline in the uninsured rate among people with incomes above 400 percent of the FPL, who are not eligible for financial assistance under the law, shows that the combination of the law’s new consumer protections and individual responsibility provision have been effective in increasing coverage.
2. Expanded coverage is improving access to care, health, and financial security for the newly insured.Nationally, the share of Americans reporting that they have forgone medical care due to cost has fallen by a third since 2010, with particularly rapid declines since the ACA’s main coverage provisions took effect in 2014. As shown in the figure below, declines in the share of people forgoing care due to cost were larger in states that saw larger declines in their uninsured rates. The report documents that states seeing larger declines in their uninsured rates have also seen larger increases in the share of people reporting that they have a personal doctor and reporting that they have had a checkup in the last 12 months. The report also reviews early evidence that expanded coverage is translating into improved health and financial security, findings consistent with research examining prior, similarly targeted coverage expansions. Notably, if experience under the ACA matches what was observed under Massachusetts health reform, 24,000 deaths are already being avoided annually because of expanded coverage under the ACA.
3. Expanded coverage is reducing the burden of uncompensated care on the health care system, especially in States that have expanded Medicaid. Using data from hospitals’ annual cost reports, the report documents that uncompensated care has fallen by more than a quarter as a share of total hospital costs from 2013 to 2015. The nationwide decline corresponds to a reduction in hospital uncompensated care costs of $10.4 billion in 2015. Medicaid expansion states have seen a much larger decline in uncompensated care as a share of hospital costs, a drop of around one half. The report reviews recent evidence that these declines are a direct result of the ACA’s coverage provisions, particularly the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.
4. Increases in Health Insurance Marketplace premiums for 2017 are a one-time pricing correction, not a harbinger of future market instability. The report presents detailed evidence that the Marketplace premium increases implemented for 2017 are one-time adjustments to accommodate the phasedown of the ACA’s transitional reinsurance program and correct for initial underpricing, not a reflection of troubling trends in underlying individual market claims costs. Moreover, the report shows that, as illustrated in the figure below, the largest premium increases since 2014 have been seen in areas of the country that had the lowest premiums in 2014, the first year of the new market. This is consistent with the view that the larger premium increases in some areas reflect the fact that insurers in those areas underpriced initially, while insurers in other areas priced appropriately or even overpriced.
5. Not only does the ACA’s design prevent a “death spiral,” but experience to date confirms that the 2017 pricing correction does not threaten market stability. Some analysts have suggested that the premium increases occurring in 2017 could cause large reductions in individual market enrollment, particularly among healthy individuals, threatening the market’s long-term stability. The report demonstrates that these fears are ill-founded. Because about two-thirds of individual market enrollees are eligible for premium tax credits, most enrollees will not be affected by higher premiums, preventing meaningful risk pool deterioration. Consistent with this view, individual market enrollment growth differed little between states seeing larger and smaller increases in the benchmark premium in 2015, and states that saw larger premium increases actually saw slightly smaller increases in claims costs, as depicted by the black lines in the figure. By contrast, for the individual market to be at risk of a death spiral, states seeing larger premium increases would have had to have seen sharply lower enrollment growth and sharply higher growth in claims costs, akin to the scenario depicted by the red lines in the figure.
6. National health expenditures are projected to be $2.6 trillion lower over the ACA’s first decade than expected prior to the ACA, even though millions more Americans now have health insurance. Cumulative national health expenditures over the 2010 through 2019 period are now projected to be $2.6 trillion lower than projected just before the ACA became law. In 2019 alone, national health expenditures are projected to be 13 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP lower than pre-ACA projections. Health care spending is projected to be lower despite expanded coverage because projections of underlying per enrollee health care spending have fallen dramatically.
7. Recent years’ slow growth in per enrollee health care spending has been seen in all major spending categories. CEA has previously noted that per enrollee health care spending has grown exceptionally slowly in both the public and private sectors under the ACA, with real private insurance spending per enrollee growing at less than one-third the rate that it grew over the pre-ACA decade and real Medicare spending per enrollee actually falling in recent years. Today’s report takes a closer look at what specific services have driven this slowdown, finding that slower growth has been seen across all three of the largest spending categories: hospital services, physician services, and prescription drugs.
8. The average premium for job-based family coverage is $3,600 lower in 2016 than if premium growth since 2010 had matched the pre-ACA decade; accounting for trends in out-of-pocket costs increases these savings to $4,400. Premiums for employer coverage have grown much more slowly in recent years than over the decade preceding the ACA, with a particularly large slowdown in the growth of workers’ direct premium contributions. The average total premium for employer-based family coverage is around $3,600 lower in 2016 than if nominal growth since 2010 had matched the pre-ACA decade, savings that accrue to workers in the form of higher wages and lower contributions to their portion of premiums. New estimates in today’s report shows that slower growth in premiums is not being “canceled out” by faster growth in out-of-pocket spending. In fact, growth in total spending—encompassing both premiums and out-of-pocket costs—has fallen by more than growth of premiums alone, as illustrated in the figure. Consistent with this, accounting for trends in out-of-pocket costs during the post-ACA period increases the 2016 savings for a family with employer-based coverage to $4,400.
9. The typical Medicare beneficiary enrolled in traditional Medicare will incur $700 less in premiums and out-of-pocket costs in 2016 due to slower growth in health care costs. Because of recent years’ slow growth in health care costs, per beneficiary Medicare spending is far below earlier projections. The premiums and cost sharing that Medicare beneficiaries pay depend directly on underlying per beneficiary costs, so lower overall Medicare spending leads to large savings for beneficiaries. The typical beneficiary enrolled in traditional Medicare will incur approximately $700 less in premiums and cost sharing in 2016 than if cost trends in Medicare had matched projections issued in 2009. As discussed in the report, this estimate does not incorporate reductions in cost sharing for prescription drugs due to the ACA’s provision closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap and lower-than-expected prescription drug spending. Including those savings would make this estimate even larger.
10. New data show continued improvement in the quality of care in hospitals, which has led to approximately 125,000 avoided deaths from 2010 to 2015. New data released yesterday by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) show that the rate of hospital-acquired conditions, like infections and complications due to medication errors, continued to decline in 2015. The overall rate of hospital-acquired conditions has fallen by 21 percent since 2010, which AHRQ estimates has led to approximately 125,000 avoided deaths through 2015. Today’s CEA report presents evidence that these declines result, at least in part, from value-based purchasing payment reforms introduced under the ACA, as well as an ACA-supported initiative to help hospitals identify and share best practices for avoiding patient harm.

very informative report. I wish I could remember all the statistics so I could counter everyone that wants to ditch Obamacare. Thanks for doing your best, President Obama. When we had private insurance before I went on Medicare, we were paying $75,000 a year for insurance because of my pre-existing condition. But we couldn’t switch insurance because no one else would insure me. I have MS.

So much talk about medicare but what about those who aren’t old enought. Ages between 18 and 55 whose wages don’t qualify for medical but buying insurance that isn’t accepted by any only low income clinics, other than emergencies 911 and then even then they still send you the bill over 1k because Obamacare doesn’t cover the procedures. Doesn’t seem to work.

A majority of those in the South Disapprove of Trump…Poll
April 12, 2018 By jamesb
An even larger majority think migrant workers should be allowed to work…..
Interesting….
This NBC News/Survey Monkey poll has a margin of error of only 1.1%, because its sample was over 15,000 people….
This is NOT a good look for Republicans and Trump who are working hard to get rid of illegal and legal immigrants who ARE the migrant workers….
That Trump has popularity problems in the South should worry the GOP because that is where the party is the strongest….
The poll should also cause people to second guess the polls that have Trump up around 70% in numbers for Republicans nation wide, since those polls do not have sample sizes anywhere near as large as this poll…
More polling on this should be done…
But it results are ominous for Republicans in the fall midterm elections…
A majority of Southerners disapprove of the job President Trump is doing in office, according to a new survey.
An NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finds 51 percent of Southerners disapprove of Trump’s job performance, compared 48 percent who approve.
The poll surveyed voters in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
The president’s strongest support comes from Mississippi, according to the poll, where 57 percent of respondents approve of his job performance.
The poll also finds that 69 percent of those in the South think migrants should be given the opportunity to obtain legal status. Another 28 percent disagree, saying they think they should be deported….

All I can say is there is no hint of this here in S.C. where indeed every Republican candidate of note in the June primaries,save for First District Rep. Mark Sanford ,a noted rebel, is running as totally pro Trump.
Indeed the main issue between the candidates is who is the most pro Trump.

20 quick observations about the American Civil War
Date: 19/03/2018Author: William 0 Comments	
This conflict has kept me up at night for as long as I can remember. Although my earliest childhood memories are about Napoleon’s disastrous retreat in Russia and the Battle of the Little Big horn, as of age 5 or 6, the American Civil War blew me away. It strikes a chord in a way that I can’t explain.
Here are 20 observations after an other year spent reading Civil War books. What caused the conflict? Was a Union victory inevitable? Was Lincoln’s course the right one? How could the Confederacy have won?
1.	Seven states certainly seceded over the ‘right’ to extend slavery, and because certain states had laws that were annoying to slave holders. Northern states had a problem with the fugitive slave law. The south wanted the federal government to back slave holders. Four states followed when violence broke out. Three were too divided to secede. Delaware had too few slaves to care. Regions in seceded states with few slaves had either no support for the Confederacy and turned against it or wanted to be left alone. 100,000 southern whites fought for the Union. Slaves sided with the Union in overwhelming numbers, tipping the scales, according to Lincoln himself. Soldiers from slave holding families were more eager to enlist and less likely to desert (see Glatthaar). The south could have easily received the guarantee that slavery would not be abolished where it already existed, but that wasn’t enough. They were also tired of having to seek compromises with their northern neighbours. They enabled Lincoln to win the election, because they -the democratic party- were divided and the slave holders were represented by three different presidential candidates, splitting the votes of the northwest and the south, a combination that often won the presidency.
2.	The Confederacy lost the war because of: disastrous strategic decisions, it’s a myth that they had the better generals. They had crippling internal divisions, pro rich policies, loss of morale because of battlefield defeats, the realization that the war had destroyed slavery, whether the Confederacy would win or not, Northern superiority, bad diplomacy, failure to sell cotton for arms, and also lack of discipline, vanity, the unwillingness of Confederate generals to cooperate, failure to use the black population in a more useful way, profit seeking by the planter class, etc That the Confederacy managed to sustain itself for four years is due to the fact of the incredible efforts of those southerners that did support the Confederacy AND because the North never managed to mobilize its full might against the south. For example, Lincoln was forced to give commands to the worst kind of generals because he needed their political support. If the South had been a determined, unified block they would have won. It also failed to keep its population fed, which led to mass desertions. Soldiers went home to protect their families. It could have fed its population if it had been able to steer a different course. Planters were unwilling to grow food and preferred profit. Plus: in the early years certain prominent northern generals refused to wage an all out war against the Confederacy, they were for a limited war to ‘gently’ force the seceded states back into the Union. At first the South could afford to make risky assaults. Lee’s first offensive operations were a bloodbath, but they did the trick. The north retreated. In the last year and a half of the war Lee did not have the manpower for such succesful offensive operations, nor did any other southern army manage to mount a succesful offensive.
3.	Why were northern men willing to fight against secession? Some did fight against slavery, but most were motivated to protest against what they saw as a breach of contract, of a violation of democratic principles, and because of southern aggression, although many were just as racist as southerners, they did despise the planters and their slaveocracy and their attempts to dictate the law of the land. Later on in the war more and more soldiers wanted to abolish slavery. German immigrants, of the post 1848 wave, saw their support of the Union as a continuation of the ideals of the failed revolution of 1848 in Europe. This support was significant. Rather incompetent generals of German descent were given important commands to tap into this German manpower pool. Union soldiers felt they were fighting for democratic principles, and for the legacy of the founding fathers, they saw Confederates as arrogant rebels who had to be taught a lesson. If they would just return to the Union, all would be forgiven. The most ‘shocking’ example is how lenient general Sherman was when the Confederacy wanted to surrender. He was willing to fight the most brutal kind of war, but as soon as the Confederates conceded defeat all was forgiven.
4.	The south lost the war, but won the peace. Although the war left the Confederacy in ruins, although they had lost their bid for independence and slavery had been abolished and effectively destroyed, Confederates were pardoned and regained political control pretty fast. The idea of the Confederacy became stronger than ever before. It’s like the Confederacy got a remarkable rebirth once it had died on the battlefield. The Myth of The Lost Cause immediately took shape. The idea of a chivalrous south, defeated only by the industrial might of money grubbing yankees with no ideals other than profit seeking.
5.	Blacks were more despised than any other minority. Blacks couldn’t serve in the ranks of the Confederate army, not even as a lowly private, whereas the last Confederate general to surrender was a Native American. A jew was the Confederacy’s Secretary of State. The irish were often despised, but Irish born generals served on both sides. Later blacks were still considered unfit to serve in the US army, whereas Native Americans were sought after and valued as soldiers. Also Latinos weren’t segregated. Any minority in the US had a hard time, but blacks were considered to be on the lowest rung of the pecking order. Interestingly enough, this was not necessarily the case in early colonial America, the oppression of blacks got worse and worse over time. For a brief period after the Civil War blacks’ political clout grew substantially, but as soon as the North stopped caring, the South reversed everything, and created a situation of ‘slavery in anything but name’. Presidents usually ignored the struggle for more rights for blacks to keep Southern whites calm. The US armed forces were desegregated and Lyndon Johnson helped the black cause along, but under Nixon the war against drugs was literally invented to oppress blacks, without running the risk of being labelled racist. The prison population of the US is gigantic and the number of blacks is statistically abnormal. In prison they are basically used as slave labor for many well-known companies. Private prisons are also an excellent investment. Blacks are still considered a threat to white women. One of the arguments used to keep slavery going. If we set them free, they will rape white women. Whereas Native Americans were admired as fierce warriors or as freedom loving rebels, blacks were seen as stupid children, not in control of their sexual urges.
6.	Slavery was a much more brutal institution than neo confederates want you to believe. Tons of examples possible. Especially the widespread sexual abuse of women and children is denied. Few want to admit that slave holders also ‘bred’ slaves and were in the slavery business to breed and sell slaves. Some large negro men were used like farmers use a particularly strong steer.
7.	Lincoln may have been a racist, but he was not a static personality, he came to view blacks more and more favorably. He was also a clever politician who knew he couldn’t abolish slavery with a snap of his fingers. A lot was at stake. He evolved and learned at an astonishing pace.
8.	Without the extension of slavery, slavery, especially in the upper south would be dead.
9.	Slaves were an excellent investment, their value kept increasing and their combined worth was more than that of any other US asset
10.	The South was not for States Rights, but against. It didn’t allow Northern states to have laws that undercut the power of the slave owners. It was only for states rights when it suited them
11.	The south said a state could secede from the union, but it didn’t allow people to secede from the Confederacy…
12.	The Confederacy liked to paint the North as hessians, murderers, plundering mercenaries, but Confederate raiders burned northern cities and kidnapped blacks in northern states, runaway slaves, but also free blacks
13.	The north did have horrible prisoner of war camps, and deliberately made life hard for Confederate prisoners, whereas it seems the south did not deliberately mistreat its white prisoners, they didn’t have the means to take care of them. It did have the official policy of shooting blacks caught in a yankee uniform. Demoralized Confederate units were placed across black regiments, because their racism morivated them to fight harder.
14.	It’s likely the Union would have lost more territory or may have fallen apart entirely if Lincoln had deciced to let them go in peace. Perhaps the northwest would also have broken off, New York city might have become an independent city state. If the North doesn’t go to war to preserve the Union, the result has to be chaos, with more regions breaking off and a very expansionist Confederacy. It had mostly been Southerners who had clamored for the war against Mexico, for example. The South was hungry for more land, not so much the North.
15.	There were prominent abolitionists in the south as well, such as the Grimké sisters
16.	Some southerners were -and they were correct in this- convinced that slavery would be better protected in the Union than outside of it. Not every pro-slavery advocate stood with the Confederacy. When Lincoln abolished slavery in rebellious areas northern enthusiasm for the war took a beating. His move did make sure that England and France would never openly side with the Confederacy
17.	I don’t see how Lincoln could have acted differently without making things worse. The Confederate elite dug its own grave
18.	Comparisons between Lincoln and Gorbachev are unfair
19.	There’s no evidence that ‘tariffs’ played a major role in bringing about the conflict
20.	The best chance for the Confederacy to win: concentrate troops in the middle and firmly occupy Kentucky and Missouri. Put the capital further inland, georgia or perhaps tennessee. Lose large parts of Virginia, but hang on to New Orleans, Wilmington, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri. Virginia should not have been the area to concentrate its best forces in. It was logistically difficult to send troops from all over the Confederacy there, a concentration in the middle was easier. When the Confederacy did focus on Tennessee it won its only major battle in the West: the battle of Chickamauga.

This database lists over 460,000 of those providers who wrote 50 or more prescriptions for at least one drug that year. More than three-fourths of these prescriptions went to patients 65 and older; the rest were for disabled patients. Methodology »

About This Data
Prescribing data from Medicare’s prescription drug benefit, known as Part D, was compiled and released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees the program. The data for 2016 includes more than 1.5 billion prescriptions written by 1.1 million doctors, nurses and other providers. This database lists over 460,000 of those providers who wrote 50 or more prescriptions for at least one drug that year. More than three-fourths of these prescriptions went to patients 65 and older; the rest were for disabled patients. Methodology »
Incorrect Info?
If you are a provider and you believe your address is incorrect, check the listing you created on the National Provider Identifier registry. If you change your listing, send a note to [email protected] and we will update your information. If you have other questions about this data, send a note to [email protected].
Caveats
No comparisons are shown if there are fewer than 20 prescribers in the state share this specialty.
Comparisons do not take into account the medical conditions of patients. Medications for certain conditions do not have generic alternatives, so patients would receive more expensive brand name drugs.
This provider's address and specialty information was last updated on Jan. 4, 2010.
Comparisons are based on each provider’s current address, not necessarily where he or she worked during the time period covered in this database.
In rare circumstances, providers' prescription tallies may be inflated. Sometimes providers are credited with prescriptions written by colleagues (this happens in long-term care facilities) or are victims of fraud involving theft of their provider number.

Reading Hospital Ranked 6th "Best Hospital" by U.S. News & World Report
Reading Hospital has once again been ranked among the top ten "Best Hospitals" in Pennsylvania by U.S. News & World Report. In addition to this top state honor, the Hospital was ranked nationally in Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT), and rated as high performing in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Colon Cancer Surgery, Heart Bypass Surgery, Heart Failure, Hip Replacement and Knee Replacement.
To help patients decide where to receive care, U.S. News generates hospital rankings by evaluating data on nearly 5,000 hospitals in 16 adult specialties, 9 adult procedures and conditions and 10 pediatric specialties. To be nationally ranked in a specialty, a hospital must excel in caring for the sickest, most medically complex patients. The ratings in procedures and conditions focus on typical Medicare patients. The U.S. News Best Hospitals methodologies in most areas of care are based largely or entirely on objective measures such as risk-adjusted survival and readmission rates, volume, patient experience, patient safety and quality of nursing, among other care-related indicators. Prominent changes to the 2018-19 rankings methodology included more emphasis on patient outcomes and patient experience measures.
"We are honored to be recognized as one of the top hospitals in Pennsylvania. Without the commitment of our exceptional employees this accomplishment would not be possible. This national recognition confirms our relentless pursuit of excellence in all that we do for the individuals and communities we care for," said Clint Matthews, President & CEO, Tower Health and Reading Hospital.
U.S. News Best Hospitals rankings, now in its 29th year, help consumers better determine which hospitals provide the best care for the most serious or complex medical conditions and procedures. Reading Hospital ranked high among some of the largest and most well-known hospitals in the state.

Democracy Now! America’s #1 Weapons Salesman: Trump Promotes U.S. Arms Manufacturers & Weakens Export Rules
May 7, 2018 ·	by Rise Up Times ·	in Corporations/Capitalism, Militarism, Trump presidency, U.S. Foreign Policy	· 1 Comment
Reuters reveals that the new initiative will provide guidelines that could allow more countries to be granted faster deal approvals, and will call on Cabinet officials to help close deals between foreign governments and U.S. defense contractors.
Democracy Now!
Published on Apr 18, 2018
https://democracynow.org – A new exposé by Reuters reveals how the Trump administration plans to make the U.S. an even larger weapons exporter by loosening restrictions on the sale of equipment ranging from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery. Reuters reveals that the new initiative will provide guidelines that could allow more countries to be granted faster deal approvals, and will call on Cabinet officials to help close deals between foreign governments and U.S. defense contractors. In one example, Reuters reveals President Trump himself urged the emir of Kuwait, in a telephone call, to finalize a $10 billion fighter jet deal with Boeing, the country’s second-largest defense contractor.
The exposé details the role U.S. Cabinet officials may be asked to play in pushing arms exports abroad as part of the new initiative, which will call for a “whole of government” approach—from the president and his Cabinet to military attachés and diplomats—to help draw in billions of dollars more in arms business overseas. The Trump administration is expected to announce the new rules as early as Thursday [sic]. We speak to Mike Stone of Reuters and William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy.

Today in History — March 2, 2018
Posted Friday, March 2, 2018 4:00 pm
Today in History
Today is Friday, March 2, the 61st day of 2018. There are 304 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On March 2, 1943, the three-day Battle of the Bismarck Sea began in the southwest Pacific during World War II; U.S. and Australian warplanes were able to inflict heavy damage on an Imperial Japanese convoy.
On this date:
In 1793, the first (and third) president of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston, was born near Lexington, Virginia.
In 1836, the Republic of Texas formally declared its independence from Mexico.
In 1867, Howard University, a historically black school of higher learning in Washington, D.C., was founded. Congress passed, over President Andrew Johnson's veto, the first of four Reconstruction Acts.
In 1877, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was declared the winner of the 1876 presidential election over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden, even though Tilden had won the popular vote.
In 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship as President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act.
In 1933, the motion picture "King Kong" had its world premiere at New York's Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy.
In 1939, Roman Catholic Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (puh-CHEL'-ee) was elected pope on his 63rd birthday; he took the name Pius XII. The Massachusetts legislature voted to ratify the Bill of Rights, 147 years after the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution had gone into effect. (Georgia and Connecticut soon followed.)
In 1958, a multinational expedition led by British explorer Vivian Fuchs completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica by way of the South Pole in 99 days.
In 1965, the movie version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "The Sound of Music," starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, had its world premiere in New York.
In 1978, the remains of comedian Charles Chaplin were stolen by extortionists from his grave in Cosier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. (The body was recovered near Lake Geneva 11 weeks later.)
In 1989, representatives from the 12 European Community nations agreed to ban all production of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), the synthetic compounds blamed for destroying the Earth's ozone layer, by the end of the 20th century.
In 1995, the Internet search engine website Yahoo! was incorporated by founders Jerry Yang and David Filo.
Ten years ago: Dmitry Medvedev, Vladimir Putin's hand-picked successor, scored a crushing victory in Russia's presidential election.
Five years ago: The day after $85 billion in across-the-board federal spending cuts went into effect, President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans refused to concede any culpability for failing to stave off the sequester. Alaska's 41st Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kicked off with a festive ceremonial start in Anchorage.
One year ago: Under intensifying pressure, Attorney General Jeff Sessions abruptly agreed to recuse himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in America's 2016 presidential election, acting after revelations he twice spoke with the Russian ambassador during the campaign and failed to say so when pressed by Congress. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was confirmed as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development on a Senate vote of 58-41; a few hours later, the Senate backed former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be energy secretary, 62-37.
(Stations: Rock musician Casey, one name, is correct)
Today's Birthdays: Actor John Cullum is 88. Author Tom Wolfe is 88. Former Soviet President and Nobel peace laureate Mikhail S. Gorbachev is 87. Actress Barbara Luna is 79. Author John Irving is 76. Actress Cassie Yates is 67. Actress Laraine Newman is 66. Former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., is 65. Former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is 63. Singer Jay Osmond is 63. Pop musician John Cowsill (The Cowsills) is 62. Tennis player Kevin Curren is 60. Country singer Larry Stewart (Restless Heart) is 59. Rock singer Jon Bon Jovi is 56. Blues singer-musician Alvin Youngblood Hart is 55. Actor Daniel Craig is 50. Actor Richard Ruccolo is 46. Rock musician Casey (Jimmie's Chicken Shack) is 42. Rock singer Chris Martin (Coldplay) is 41. Actress Heather McComb is 41. Actress Rebel Wilson is 38. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard is 37. NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is 36. Musician Mike "McDuck" Olson (Lake Street Dive) is 35. Actor Robert Iler is 33. Actress Nathalie Emmanuel is 29. Singer-rapper-actress Becky G is 21.
Thought for Today: "Humor has a tremendous place in this sordid world. It's more than just a matter of laughing. If you can see things out of whack, then you can see how things can be in whack." — Theodor Seuss Geisel (GY'-zuhl), AKA "Dr. Seuss," American children's author (born this date in 1904, died 1991).

George Monbiot, Honorary Member of Saving Our Planet!
In News And Views by admin April 9, 2018 Leave a Comment
We are pleased to announce that George Monbiot, British author, journalist and regular contributor to The Guardian newspaper on environmental topics, has agreed to become an Honorary Member of Saving Our Planet.
George Monbiot’s most recent books:
Out of the Wreckage – A New Politics for an Age of Crisis
How Did We Get into This Mess? – Politics, Equality, Nature
Feral: Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers of Rewilding
Bring on the Apocalypse: Six Arguments for Global Justice
Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning
George Monbiot’s articles on Climate Change include:
The Smog Chancellor – Who is the world’s leading environmental vandal? The answer may surprise you.
Don’t Look Now – The media avoids the subject of climate breakdown – to do otherwise is to bring the entire infrastructure of thought crashing down
The Pollution Paradox – Dirty industries spend more on politics, keeping us in the fossil age.
The Drums of War – The combination of automation, complexity and climate change is dangerous in ways we haven’t even begun to grasp.
The Flight of Reason – Sorry, but you cannot build new runways and prevent climate breakdown
What Lies Beneath – It’s a simple choice: stop all fossil fuel prospecting, or break the Paris agreement on climate change.
The Purse is Mightier Than the Pen – The climate crisis is here, now, but a compromised, corrupted media doesn’t want to know.
Mumbo-Jumbo Jets – I see the people on trial for occupying a runway at Heathrow as democratic heroes.
Sacrifice – The joints of meat that do more damage than a long-haul flight
Life and Death – The remarkable decline in violence between humans suggests that we could also restrain our violence against the planet.
Cop-Out – The COP21 climate talks in Paris were not the success that governments claim, but a disastrous failure.
A Storm of Ignorance – Censoring official advice, stripping the hills and rivers, the government ensures that disasters like the Cumbria floods will keep recurring.
Look Around – There are plenty of real problems with aircraft emissions. But thousands of people are obsessed instead with a fairy tale.
Churchill Syndrome – Why is the government so quick to bomb, yet so slow to act on climate change?
Nothing to See Here – In the greatest environmental disaster of the 21st Century (so far), Indonesia has been blotted out by smoke. And the media.
China Syndrome – We should stop recycling the old “Yellow Peril” myth. The people most hostile to action on climate change are American and British, not Chinese.
A Prehistory of Violence – It now looks as if the greatest mass extinction on Earth – 250 million years ago – was caused by fossil fuel burning.
A Hole in the System – The outrageous, untold story of how big business dumps its costs on us.
Applauding Themselves to Death – Why the UN climate talks have wasted 23 years, and how this can change.
A State Licence to Rob the Public – The government has torpedoed its promised community energy revolution – to the benefit of big business.
Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power
– Julie Wornan

Talk to Them

Solidarity march for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. Solidarity and empathy is spread among all citizens – regardless of their origin. (Flickr: sébastien amiet;l Nikleitz 2015/licensed under CC BY 2.0)
What shocked me the most was the coldness with which he murdered the policeman. Spanish news programs didn’t hesitate in showing the scene. We could all see how the terrorist ruthlessly shot to death the police officer who was lying in the street, unarmed and wounded.
The Charlie Hebdo attack is a challenge to European values. It not only is the cruel murder of innocent people. It is an attack to our freedom.
Now that the nightmare is over, questions arise. How is Europe as a society going to respond to this problem?
Let’s think for a moment. The two brothers that committed the attack to the satirical magazine were born in France. They grew up in an orphanage. The eldest one was a sports coach.
“My worry is that we simplify things.”
His younger sibling worked delivering pizzas. What could possibly make them embrace a terrorist group, leave their country to fight for Al Qaeda and then return to kill twelve people in such a brutal way?
My worry is that we simplify things. Many people in Europe are already talking of an “islamization” of our continent. Some parties will want to use this attack politically. But we must bear something in mind. Jihadists are a small minority inside of Islam. A vast majority of the European Muslims respect and cherish our values and liberties.
The policeman whose brutal murder we could watch on TV was, in fact, a Muslim. His name was Ahmed. He died defending one of the core French republican values, the freedom of expression. And let us not forget that most of the victims of jihadist terrorism around the world are Muslims.
Therefore, we as young Europeans have a responsibility. We must promote and defend our values and system of liberties. And we must have a critical and tolerant point of view. Many young Muslims in Europe feel excluded, unwanted and rejected. Some of them may see “martyrdom” and fanaticism as a way out to their situation. What course of action should we take? My answer is simple: talk to them.

Must-Read Roundup #2
A record of worthwhile reading (and watching!)

An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power (2017) – Official Trailer – Paramount Pictures
An Inconvenient Sequel
via Paramount Pictures
We can’t wait to see this film, and it comes at such a critical time. This year we reached Earth Overshoot Day on August 2nd, which has moved back 4.5 months over the past 30 years—the point at which our consumption exceeds the Earth’s yearly capacity to sequester emissions and regenerate resources. Mind-boggling stuff, and incredibly important to start asking questions about what we all can do, even in the smallest capacity—to take action and to take it seriously.

700 Marine Species Might Go Extinct Because of Plastic Pollution. Here Are 5 Ways You Can Help!
via One Green Planet
The rate at which plastic is poisoning our oceans is exponential, and marine ecosystems are suffering to the point of extinction—severe, right? “According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in one year alone, the U.S. produces a staggering 32 million tons of plastic waste and only around nine percent is recovered for recycling.” The plastic pollution is coming from you and me, and these achievable tips will help you avoid adding to the problem.
In an episode of War On Waste Australia, presenter Craig Reucassel rolls a massive ball of plastic bags up to Parliament to prompt a ban on the bag. Video: ABC TV

What would it take for you to remember to bring your reusable shopping bag to the supermarket? We make sure to keep a couple near the front door, as well as in the glove box of our car, which works for us! We’re pretty excited to hear that the major supermarkets are set to ban the bag—FINALLY!

How not to create traffic jams, pollution and urban sprawl
via The Economist
“There is a one-word answer to why the streets of Los Angeles look so different from those of London, and why neither city resembles Tokyo: parking. For as long as there have been cars, there has been a need to store them when they are not moving—which, these days, is about 95% of the time.
Free parking is not, of course, really free. The costs of building the car parks, as well as cleaning, lighting, repairing and securing them, are passed on to the people who use the buildings to which they are attached. Restaurant meals and cinema tickets are more pricey; flats are more expensive; office workers are presumably paid less. Everybody pays, whether or not they drive.”

POTUS Trump eviscerates anti-American DEMS over refusal to back border security
Posted on June 3, 2018 in Democrats, Illegal Immigration, Immigration, National Security, President Donald Trump, White House // 1 Comment
Tweet
(National Sentinel) The Wall: During his weekly address to the nation on Saturday, President Donald Trump laced into congressional Democrats over their continued refusal to back any border security whatsoever.
In addition, he accused them of “resisting the will of the American voter” by continually stalling his agenda and blocking his nominees.
The president noted:
Senate Democrats call it the resistance. They’re resisting the will of the American voter, and it is not good.
From day one, Senate Democrats have shamelessly obstructed, stalled, and filibustered the confirmations of hundreds of talented men and women who are eager to come to Washington, DC to make a difference. They want to serve our country.
My nominees face a longer average confirmation wait than any in the history of our country. Today, more than 300 of our nominees are still awaiting a vote. Last June, I nominated Isabel Patelunas to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis. Now, almost a year later, this tremendously qualified professional, with nearly three decades of intelligence experience, is still awaiting confirmation. She’s given up so much. She’s left areas. She’s moved from homes. And she’s still not confirmed. It’s a disgrace.
Democrats in Congress are also blocking urgently needed improvements to our border security. They don’t want border security for two reasons: Number one, they don’t care about it. Number two, they’re afraid it’s going to make me and the Republicans look good, and they don’t want that. That comes before our country.
They’ve blocked every effort to close deadly loopholes to keep out vicious criminals and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. They are a disaster at the border. These actions are endangering our citizens, threatening our communities, and undermining our national security.
It is time for Senate Democrats to stop resisting the will of the American people. So, very simply, stop resisting the will of the American people, and to start working across the aisle to deliver for all citizens.
We love our country. We want to keep our country great. Thank you very much.”

1 Comment on POTUS Trump eviscerates anti-American DEMS over refusal to back border security	
V.Lombardi // June 4, 2018 at 4:57 am // Reply	
Trump is being loyal to his party as the “leaders” of his party continually backstab him. For example, Ryan, an immigration leftist, has never supported anything to restrict immigration. Ryan will never allow actual border security.

How Gun Friendly Is Your State?

Cowboy, Firearm, Gun, Holster
Last week at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show (SHOT Show), Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson proudly announced that Remington Outdoor Company and Sig Sauer are expanding operations in his state, creating more jobs. In the one post I read about the firearm company’s expansion, it listed Arkansas as being the third most gun friendly state with 42 registered firearms owners per 1,000 residents.
That got my curiosity going and set out to find out who the number 1 friendliest state for gun owners was, where my current state of residence falls on the list and who are the least friendly states for gun owners so I turned to Guns and Ammo to see what they said.
I have to admit that I was pleased to see that my home state that I refer to as God’s country topped Guns and Ammo list as being the friendliest state for gun owners. Based upon their ‘strong laws with an unmatched shooting culture and strong industry presence’, Arizona was ranked number 1.
“Arizona gets full points in every category with both permitless and permitted carry, strong self-defense laws, a ‘shall sign’ NFA statue and a thriving competitive shooting scene. Whether you’re into ISPC-style shooting, 3-Gun, long-range rifles, Cowboy matches, shotgunning or just shooting machine guns in the desert, Arizona has everyone covered.”
Number 2 on Guns and Ammo list was a huge surprise to me…

The 50 Most Drug-Addled Albums in Music History
Sean Beaudoin
Wednesday, February 26, 2014	
RAMPANT MADNESS, cheap powder, and the whiskey river: below are the 50 most debauched, sodden, and certifiable records in music history.
The rules are simple: being merely eccentric while swathed in outlandish clothing fails to qualify. Having done an epic amount of street powder while getting handjobs in the groupie van is not enough. Hell, Steven Tyler claims to have spent $3 million on cocaine over the years, but would Aerosmith have sounded one iota different if they’d been straight edge? It’s the same reason Mötley Crüe doesn’t warrant space on this list. Sure, they snorted live ants (actually, that was Ozzy) and mainlined Jack Daniel’s to stave off epic boredom, but their music would have been exactly the same steaming pile of hair regardless.
No, to make this list, the music on a given album has to bleed chemical influence while also leaching a very specific brand of desperation and/or madness. The vocals, the rhythm, the melody–all have to be drenched in reverb, compression, and frighteningly altered states that could not have been recorded any other way. Except through a blind leap into the void.
And sometimes madness itself is that chemical.
Roll it, pour it, cook it, crush it, or just get stone-cold crazy; the needle will drop into the groove either way.
But excess is never enough. There also has to be undeniable beauty. And there is. Every single album on this list is a remarkable document, and warrants repeated listens over the course of a lifetime.
Also, no reggae allowed.
50. Skip Spence – Oar
The place where this list had to start, essentially the Rosetta Stone for drug-induced madness, this is an archive of excess. Spence was a founding member of both Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape, who spent months howling at the walls in Bellevue after epic runs of windowpane LSD. Just after his release he was cynically recorded, releasing Oar, which is a mix of shambling nonsense and haunting ballads, soul-baring and childish in turns. The despair is palpable. This album has been passed around for years among giggling heads, serious collectors, and those in recovery looking for inspiration or something to truly fear. Everyone had a piece of Spence but Spence, who spent the rest of his life in one institution or another.
49. Spacemen 3 – Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To
You’d have to figure when it’s spelled out so blatantly they’re probably pure-veined Mormons pulling off an elaborate inside joke. Nope. This fuzzed-out squeamish throb of an album begs for either Jesus or rehab in every other line, each of which is held uncomfortably long, the vocal equivalent of a mescaline freak staring at the wrinkles on their palm: have you ever noticed how your hand looks like a highway overpass? So what if the other songs often sound embarrassingly like all of the Velvet Underground compressed into one scorched spoon? What matters is that each track smells like a week crashed in a Manchester apartment trying (and failing) to have sex with Jesus and Mary Chain groupies on a velour couch covered in cigarette burns and drool.
48. David Bowie – Heroes
Station to Station would be the obvious choice from the Bowie discography, if only because even amongst his other slabs of space oddity and forced outrageousness, Station is notoriously hunkered in a blizzard of cocaine of the quality usually reserved for Bolivian generals and DuPont heiresses. It’s a landscape of head-shaved, locked-door madness in which a thin white duke might spend six months grinding his jaw, whispering epic gibberish into a cheap microphone. Each song sounds gargled and twitchy, run through a filter of back-of-the-throat gak. And yet the choice here is Heroes, if only because it was recorded in Berlin, where Bowie and Iggy went to clean up, trading powder for midgets and sex clubs and random Prussian decadence. There the high was a tantalizing memory, and the resultant album even more amazing for its utterly bloodless inflections. Heroes is a nut-cutting, blue ice, deep Arctic void of an album. As well as totally brilliant.
47. Eddie Cochran – C’mon Everybody
Is there any more powerful drug than unfocused teenage sexuality? Either through orgasm or chemical rush, Cochran’s raspy bass voice and “fuck ’em all” lyrics lit an intoxicating pyre under the first 50’s wave of rockabilly crossovers, which were absolutely dripping with the primal frustration and random anger unmatched by later, more overtly sexual acts. Cochran’s filthy twang, which ruled the radio waves when panties were still pure, can be heard in nearly every rock band since, from Led Zeppelin to the White Stripes, decades of ready bobby-soxers mainlining shuffle rhythm to get their rocks off. Cochran died in a car crash at age 21.
46. The Replacements – All Shook Down
Widely hated by most Replacements fanatics, All Shook Down is a grim slog through the wreckage of the band that is austere and revealing in turns. It’s pre-rehab but post-realization, a dissipated reprieve where stock must be taken and hard decisions made. Paul Westerberg sounds nearly bereft, the money spent, the bottles broken, the giddy buzz ten years gone. The rest of the band is surly and indifferent in turns. Founding guitarist Bob Stinson had already been “fired” for his erratic behavior and clumsy leads, left to deal (and die) with his addiction and mental illness alone—and the resultant karma is palpable. That said, the album is a slab of unwitting truth that has been more or less ignored since its release.
45. JJ Cale – Naturally
This album, released in 1971, is mostly known for the song “After Midnight,” which would be butchered a few years later by Eric Clapton–a fact Cale was completely unaware of until he heard his own song on the radio, transformed into a 70’s radio staple and moneymaking pow(d)erhouse. Whether Cale continued to abuse white lines, or just sound like he did, this album is like a sunny afternoon in a hammock with a beautiful girl, a joint, and decades of easy living ahead. Cale’s signature laid back virtuosity is in evidence track-by-track. There’s a reason Neil Young called Cale and Jimi Hendrix the “best electric guitar players I ever heard.” And that reason is because Cale managed to make every single song he ever recorded sound like 2am in downtown Tulsa, standing outside a bar that serves free hot dogs.
44. Nick Drake – Pink Moon
The final studio album recorded by Drake, it is the only one of the three without a backing band, and the stripped-down quality of the songs palpably reflects his mental state at the time, one of harrowing depression. Drake overdosed on pills at age twenty-six, but left this album as a legacy, one mostly ignored at the time but now rightly regarded as brilliant– a collection of delicate and starkly personal statements that makes no concession to anything but simple expression and sheer despair.
43. Miles Davis – Bitches Brew
Here Davis purposely and irrevocably destroys his legacy as Cool Birther and icon of be-bop by recording an incendiary slice of rock-tinged funk jazz, replete with upper register wah-trumpet, John McLaughlin’s fusion licks, and enough pimp stroll overtones to soundtrack the entire output of Iceberg Slim. The fact that Davis was aware that Jimi Hendrix was repeatedly dalliancing with his wife (the Funk/Diva legend Betty Davis) must have had an affect on the direction of his groove. Or maybe it was just the heroin. In any case, this is an absolute monster of an album, an unrepentant middle finger to jazz snobs, and a down-on-the-corner statement that throbs and wobbles and ultimately refuses to resolve itself in any context. It’s one of the most towering musical statements of the 20th century, a composition of 70’s black street life, the madness, the drugs, the hustle, the humanity. This is Proust in eight sides, four albums, one vision.
42. Jeff Simmons – Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up
Former member of the Mothers of Invention, Simmons left to go record a pair of albums for the Straight label, Lucille being anything but. It sounds like every 15-year-old’s room in 1970–black lights, bongs, riffs, solos and Zap-boogie arrangements with plenty of guitar noodling to shore up the tweaked lyrics. This is the album I Dream of Jeannie would be humming to if she’d lived in a bong instead of a bottle.
41. Dead Boys – Young Loud and Snotty
Cleveland’s own answer to The Stooges and The New York Dolls, the Dead Boys were a dumber, drunker slice of the distorted NY thrash-cake. Featuring the rude spasm of Stiv Bators and Cheetah Chrome, this album was produced by Ten Wheel Drive’s Genya Ravan (formally of one of the first all-girl bands ever, Goldie and The Gingerbreads–real name: Goldie Zelkowitz). The Dead Boys owned CBGB for a while, trading on their combination of anthemic stupidity, surly brilliance, and rivers of cheap booze. Listening to this album is like soaking in bourbon-flavored Palmolive: an absolute joy.
40. Bobby Fuller – Let Her Dance
Most famous for the early-sixties hit “I Fought The Law”, which has been covered by every punk band in history, and which he originally recorded (but was actually written by Sonny Curtis–who wrote the theme to the Mary Tyler Moore Show), The Bobby Fuller Four’s “Let Her Dance” is a genius example of throwback fifties rock run through an echo chamber of surf-reverb. The effect is both intoxicating and disconcerting, like the best moments of being high in any context. Having once appeared in the movie The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini with Nancy Sinatra and Boris Karloff, Fuller was found dead in the front seat of his car, soaked in kerosene. It was initially ruled a suicide, but some people think he’d been taking acid the night before at a party with members of the Manson family, who ran away after almost being spotted burning an overdosed Fuller, in order to hide evidence of his death.
39. Legendary Pink Dots – Shadow Weaver
Producers of over 40 albums, this band, led by the magisterial Edward Ka-Spel, is a mix of Skinny Puppy, King Crimson, and a massive dose of tainted mescaline. Shadow Weaver itself is a tributary of prog-madness and lysergic atmospheres. “City of Needles”, “Leper Colony”, and “Ghosts of Unborn Children” are utterly demented and terrifying highlights.
38. Meat Puppets – Meat Puppets II
Listening to the Meat Puppets is like hanging onto the end of a length of cyclone fencing being swung in circles by your unstable older brother. No other band has ever captured the musical axis of evil (dueling country-fried guitar licks, heroin/punk sensibility and ghostly soprano vocals) quite as capably as the Kirkwood brothers. Legendary for their addictions, instability, and multiple rehabs, they still play like runaway geniuses. Curt Kirkwood sings like a wounded squirrel, his piercing warble the perfect compliment to the desert-inflected marching cowpunk anthems. Too High To Die would have been a fine choice for an album in this spot, but “Split Myself In Two” is such a perfect metaphor for drug lust/disgust that it could not be avoided.
37. Serge Gainsbourg – Rock Around The Bunker
This bizarre coke-fueled Nazi inflected rock drama is so drowning in weird intentions and barely understood metaphor that it’s like snorting a doomed line of Borax. Still, Gainsbourg’s smooth baritone and in-jokey French Asshole delivery totally delivers. One of the least scrutable albums ever recorded, the kind of thing that could only have made sense on the high wire of huit straight days of very, very expensive accelerants.
36. Elliott Smith – Either/Or
Elliott Smith died at age 34 of two stab wounds to the chest, which was ruled a suicide but is still inconclusive by many accounts. A heavy user of drugs and alcohol, as well as a sufferer of mental illness, Smith nevertheless put out six albums before his death, many of which are now acclaimed by cognoscenti as among the best of their generation. But it is Either/Or in which his greatest strengths and vulnerabilities are showcased. Using a spiderweb-thin delivery, over quavering and vulnerable chords, his songs are raw and simple and unusually affecting.
35. Bud Powell – The Amazing Bud Powell
The eccentrically brilliant co-inventor of bebop, and percussive rapid-tempo keyboard daredevil had already been committed to Bellevue by the time he recorded The Amazing, in which he can be regularly heard doing his signature growling and mumbling along with the rhythm. After being arrested for public drunkenness (during which he was likely sober and manic) and being beaten by the police, enforced electroshock therapy made him alternately violent and despondent. Soon after, his beloved brother Ritchie would be killed in the same car crash as the genius trumpet player Clifford Brown. Powell eventually died of TB and neglect, one of the greatest piano players of the twentieth century. This album is a legacy of his pain and brilliance.
34. The Libertines – The Libertines
A side of raw crack with a heroin chaser. An absolutely loathsome album in its oblivious self-involvement and rampant narcissism, and yet sort of a genius slab of pop drenched in undeniable hooks and hopeless dissipation. The studio tales are lurid, the tour debauchery even worse. Junkie lore in ’77 Detroit is one thing, white-Brit junkie 2003 with a side of Kate Moss is something else entirely. Still, “Can’t Stand Me Now” or “The Man Who Would Be King” pushed past third-form dorm angst and proved worth every ounce of navel gaze hatred.
33. Iggy Pop – Kill City
The musical equivalent of Death on the Installment Plan. Iggy in mental hospital for junk withdrawal. James Williamson takes over, who everyone hates, and starts barking orders. The absolute end of the Stooges, launch of Iggy solo, a memento of junk-trash-bravado, barely listenable but breathtaking in its nihilism and lack of talent. A pure historical statement: this is your band on drugs.
32. The Rolling Stones – Exile on Main Street
It is well known that Keith Richards shot a genuinely protean amount of heroin during the Stones’ debauched encampment at Ville Nellcoté in the south of France during the recording of Exile on Main Street. Gram Parsons spent a (un)healthy amount of time hanging about as well. It got so bad that Mick and Bianca rented an apartment a few hours away and only showed up to lay down the occasional track while the rest of the boys hung out in the basement practicing “Ventilator Blues” while waiting for Keith to rouse from his opiate coma long enough to fuck up another guitar line. And yet, somehow, Exile is by far the greatest Stones record, and one of the greatest rock records of all time–despite each and every note being dipped in pure molten poppy.
31. Johnny Thunders – So Alone
There are addicts, and then there are fiends. Johnny Thunders’ hero was Keith Richards, an emulation he took very seriously. Post-NY Dolls, his band the Heartbreakers were simultaneously a kickass rockabilly NY trash rock outfit as well as a traveling dimebag circus (add Jerry Nolan, minus Richard Hell, etc). And Johnny was the worst purveyor, both the lead-slinging hero and the stumbling shit-veined clown. So Alone features relatively crappy Ventures knockoffs (actually the Chantays) as well as Zappa-esque 50’s pop recreations and the reasonably affecting “You Can’t Put Your Arm Around a Memory.” This album is essentially a dried cotton ball, a clogged spike, a foul-smelling pair of leather pants left at the corner of Lexington and 53rd. His bizarre and relatively unexplained death in New Orleans only adds to the mystique of this excellent but reeking album.
30. Harry Nilsson and John Lennon – Pussy Cats
Notorious for his epic appetites, and justly lauded for his first few albums, 1974 found Harry Nilsson in the studio with friend and fellow debauchee John Lennon. The two had caroused at length around LA, regularly being kicked out of clubs and restaurants for absurd behavior, finally deciding to cut an album together. Nilsson, whose beautiful and delicate vocals had highlighted earlier releases, got into a coke-fueled competition with Lennon about who could scream their parts louder and ruptured a vocal cord. His voice was never the same. This album is one blurry inside joke after another, with unusual and surreal arrangements of songs from Jimmy Cliff to Bob Dylan that is steeped in a fortnight of hard drugs and harder lessons.
29. Shuggie Otis – Freedom Flight
Conceivably the most pleasantly baked album ever recorded. Funky, smooth, and with sweetwater vocals by Shuggie himself, son of strident bandleader Johnny Otis. Bad trip? This is your listen. Pot cookies and lemonade? You’re right there too. This is a Manhattan balcony, a sunny August, a mellow blunt, a cookout with pals, and a dalliance with horns. If a more chill album ever existed, especially before the word chill ever existed, I’d be terrified to hear it: you might be lulled into a short, blissful nap you’d never wake up from.
28. Suicide – Suicide
Without question one of the seminal albums of the 70’s, and possibly one of the greatest anti-rock opuses ever. Manhattan streets plus No Wave plus Jukebox Teardrop. You wanna take a swing by Deuce Avenue? Minimalism? Psychobilly? Yellow speed plus acid? Pure stoned synesthesia: genius. Also the third best album ever recorded to randomly ingest half of your mother’s medicine cabinet to.
27. James Ramey – The Baby Huey Story
At over 400 pounds and an unrepentant junkie, it’s not much of a surprise that Baby Huey died of a drug-related heart attack at the age of twenty-six. What is a surprise is how his sole album remains one of the best and most obscure slabs of funk recorded in the 70’s. With incredibly tight horn arrangements and a throbbing spine of a bass, Ramey’s truly raw and expressive voice carries each track well beyond the usual. What really propels the album though, in the end, is the other-worldly screech Ramey often released, part James Brown, part Grace Jones, part deeply wounded man. It pierces as it funks, skunking it’s way through high after dirty backbeat high.
26. Arthur Brown – The Crazy World of Arthur Brown
The God of Hellfire was a histrionic showman often lowered onstage by a rope wearing a flaming metal mask. Which sometimes required being doused by beer to keep from being badly burned. One of the few people ever kicked off of a tour with Jimi Hendrix for outlandishness and chemical excess, Brown continued to wear a colander on his head while reaping the royalties from the hit “Fire.” The rest of the album is a surprisingly sturdy blues rehash, stealing bits from James Brown and Screaming Jay Hawkins and then forcing them through a psychedelic mash of bravado and pure methanol.
25. Charles “Packy” Axton – Late Night Party
One of the kings of ’70’s Memphis and a driving force behind Stax records, Axton was also a hard-partying sax player whose tracks laid over the top of any number of grooving instrumentals that sound as if they were blown through a bottle of bourbon at 3am in the parking lot behind a mortuary off Beale Street. He more or less owned a very particular boozy groove later made popular by any number of different musicians, although he got little to no credit for it.
24. My Bloody Valentine – Loveless
When every vein in your body is packed with Robitussin and molten navel junk swirl. When every molecule in your body is an illegal one, a Kabul one, cut-with-strychnine buzz. Achingly beautiful drone, lush distorted lines piled on top of one another, almost whispered and gentle vocals, pistil meets stamen in front of a screeching Marshall stack. Some of the most beautiful music ever recorded.
23. Jeff Buckley – Grace
His musician-father Tim Buckley died at the height of his fame from an alcohol/heroin overdose. Jeff, apparently straight for most of his early career, was drinking and getting high regularly during the recording of this grittily opulent album, his second. Buckley’s multi-octave voice and tortured delivery sound like a mix between Robert Plant and Anthony and the Johnsons in a hot tub full of tequila. Buckley drowned after jumping into the Wolf River for a swim fully clothed and wearing work boots. There is much speculation as to whether it was intentional or not, but the beauty of these songs is unquestioned.
22. Arthur Russell – Springfield
Classically-trained cellist Russell moved to Manhattan in the early seventies and quickly ingratiated himself into the underground gay dance/electronica scene, wedding compositional minimalism with looped cello, poppers, crank, amyl, and disco backbeats–the result of which is an amazing and wholly original pastiche. Russell’s monotone and disaffected vocals ride above unusual arrangements to form songs that sound like nothing so much as aural cough syrup–heavy, twitchy, deep, stoned, genuinely beautiful.
21. The 13th Floor Elevators – 13th Floor Elevators
Truly a document of madness and mental disintegration. Roky Erikson was a notorious acid head in the Texan/Manson mold, and this album sounds like nothing so much as a very, very bad trip with enforced attendance at a dude ranch with barbed wire and collective meals and group prayer–not to mention bird-like vocals and strummy guitars and insane neck-stab snare hits. Apocalypse music.
20. James Booker– Spiders on The Keys
Without question the single best junkie, black, gay, one-eyed, patch-wearing, proto-genius keyboard monster piano player ever to come out of New Orleans, let alone the rest of the world. This album is so consistently flamboyant and resplendent with technique and junkie fuckups that it’s a primer in how to be great and high and greatly high at the same time. A colossal, wonderful mess.
19. The Brian Jonestown Massacre – Methodrone
Anton Newcombe, singer, guitar player, and mind behind BJM was a notorious junkie, crackpot, and dictator. Although he did once say “People talk about Eric Clapton. What has he ever done except throw his baby off a fuckin’ ledge and write a song about it?”, which I am inclined to agree with. This album is soaked in methadone, pot, alcohol, heroin, speed and unnecessary overdubs. Like Joe Stalin with a nose full. And yet, a semblance of genius. These songs bleed rehab and untethered desire.
18. Eddie “Smeero” Hazel – Games, Dames, and Guitar Thangs
Ah, god, is this album high. Hazel, architect of the greatest of Parliament/Funkadelic’s guitar solos, including the epic 10 minute intro to “Maggot Brain”, was more or less kicked out of the band due to his predilections and as a response recorded this genius slab of mess. Hazel-fuzz is like mother’s milk, one of the true gods of 70’s funk, unslakable thirst, and endless appetites.
17. Hasil Adkins – Peanut Butter Rock and Roll
Singlehandedly founded psychobilly, not to mention carving an entire career out of singing about hot dogs and Kentucky Fried Chicken, Adkins was a true madman, his songs barely on the verge of comprehension or sanity. Adkins died ten days after purposely being run over by an ATV in his front yard.
16. Cymande – Cymande
Happy, positive, full of amazing hooks and melodies, this island-jam pop-funk album is the distillation of the best joint you ever smoked, or a sticky drink with an umbrella in it being sipped at a poolside-bar. This is the talk down of every bad vibe, every bad acid trip, every argument with your wife about what to tip the bellboy. A skinny dip into the affirmative, high as a smiling, welcoming kite.
15. Joy Division – Closer
Lead singer Ian Curtis hung himself in his kitchen. It only gets darker and more grim from there. The soundtrack to ennui, tedium, enervation, malaise, lassitude, and Weltschmerz while somehow remaining vital and transformative. Like an iron lung full of despair, this is marching music, a parade of one through the Manchester back streets.
14. The Butthole Surfers – Locust Abortion Technician
Without question THE most terrifying album ever recorded, and purportedly done so at the tail end of oceans of cheap acid, this record, if played at correct volumes, can strip the paint off your ’83 Camry. Legendary Texas madman and insufferable genius Gibby Haynes lays it all on the line here, and then goes twelves steps over. I was once listening to “O-Men” on my headphones in a cubicle in college and the librarian came and tapped me on the shoulder and said “people are complaining about the frequencies coming from you.” Yes, that is a true story. I dare anyone to listen to “Kunts” at top volume, alone in a house at midnight, with all the lights off.
13. Billie Holiday – Lady Sings The Blues
Although this album is for some reason relatively well regarded, by 1956 Billie’s vocals had deteriorated badly due to a brutal touring schedule, along with heroin and alcohol abuse. Her performance here is gutty and raw, a professional vainly trying to deliver in the face of diminished skills, and it is unbearably sad. The elder Holiday, with seemingly full knowledge of the loss of nearly god-like vocal gifts, manages to grind through a slate of standards, and the one song that bears her writing credit, “God Bless the Child.” This album is a car wreck, unreflective of a lifetime of genius.
12. Neil Young – Trans
Sure, Neil was clean by the time this came out, and a better choice would have been Tonight’s the Night or On The Beach, both recorded under veils of heroin and U-Hauls full of cheap dirtweed even David Crosby wouldn’t smoke, but Trans is the choice because this is what happens after your brain is sodden with drugs: you buy a vocorder and make 1982’s best Kraftwerk cover album.
11. Love 666 –American Revolution
Heirs to a sludgey vein of post-MC5 grind, and purveyors of your aunt’s stolen blood pressure medication hoarded with half a six-pack of Malt Liquor, this tower of indifferent noise and silo-echo epitomizes an 80’s droning nihilism that wants to hunker in fields of corn, but trades scabs at the corner of 6th and Q instead.
10. Houndog – Houndog
A home-recorded slice of nothingness from Los Lobos’ David Hidalgo, this afterthought of a Latino blues side project is so utterly pot-drenched it smells like the carpet torn out of the back of a ’71 Ford Econoline, stored in Geezer Butler’s garage for twenty years, lent to Cyprus Hill to use as bong screens, and then sold to Jimmy Cliff’s niece for eighty bucks a square inch. It’s heavy, deep, brutally stoned, magnificently ruined.
9. Fleetwood Mac – Rumors
Tusk, which was brilliantly named after Mick Fleetwood’s nose, up which half of Peru was once snorted, is probably the wiser choice here. But Rumors, for all its great songwriting and Lindsay Buckingham’s truly brilliant guitar, is really the only option. Because not only is this 70’s juggernaut bathed in booze and coke, it is simultaneously drenched in the pain of broken relationships and illicit inter-band fucking.
8. Marvin Gaye – Here my Dear
Absolutely pulsating with the subliminal knowledge of the existence of an entire culture of people who don’t do cocaine and yet are somehow, inexplicably, reasonably happy. Still, there is transcendent soul to be sung, so why not, in the depths of withdrawal, sing it anyway? Full of naked guile and often so transparently duplicitous it’s painful, Here is a blatant ploy to get paid and get out of a contract, full of rote instrumentation and laughable keyboard fills. And yet, it’s a poignant crumbled-life confessional with some beautiful harmonies and naked lyrics.
7. Paul McCartney – McCartney II
It’s astonishing how stoned and demented this album is coming from the nice and respectable Beatle. Sounds like it was recorded in McCartney’s home studio after a thousand Meerschaum pipes of top-notch Turkish hashish and….turns out it was. Amazingly progressive in retrospect, this is a testament to late-night madness and access to very expensive recording equipment that occasionally sounds like Devo outtakes. If this album were released under someone else’s name, it would be hailed as one of the groundbreaking sides of the late 70’s. For Paul, though, it’s just an irreverent, baked mess.
6. Henry Rollins –
Each and every song is utterly drunk on sweaty men and barely sublimated homosexuality. I was at three different Rollins shows, all of them full of muscled skinheads who tried desperately to start a fight with me, all while watching cut Henry Rollins, wearing nothing but insanely small 70’s jogging shorts and a sweaty sixpack run through his set. It was only after I moved to San Francisco that I realized those skinheads were mostly angry about not being able to take a reflective moment and quietly admit to their heavily leathered brethren they were, in fact, pretty damn sweat-loving. They didn’t want to fight me, they wanted to take me out for an omelet. For deeply closeted muscle cases, moshing is speed dating, and gay is the drug that Dare Not Speak Its Name.
5. Royal Trux – Twin Infinitives
A dirty junkie laundry pile of an album. Husband and wife heroin team. The 90’s stuffed through a cheesecloth of Star Wars effects and unintelligible monkey groans. This record is so astonishingly fucked up that it’s amazing it ever got released, let alone widely reviewed. It’s a map of where not to go, what not to play, notes not to sing, effects not to use, and debauchery not to engage in. It’s a black suckhole of cigarette butts and shitty Ohio street dope. Only a fool with a phase pedal could think this was brilliance, and yet it is, because it’s so amazingly high that it’s like an Alan Lomax expedition into 1690’s Guyana. It’s pre-language. Pre-historic. A mewly babyfood mess of an album so far beyond stupid it’s awesome.
4. Lou Reed – The Blue Mask
The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat would be a more expected, and perfectly legitimate choice for a template of heroin excess, especially since at those early shows Lou used to mime tying off onstage, injecting himself, and then handing the needle as a souvenier to a lucky audience member. But for my money Lou’s post-Velvets action is far more demented, wallowing as it does in just the brand of angry, lower Manhattan kink that only the man who recorded Metal Machine Music to prove the point that ultimate music was ultimately soulless could ever get away with.
3. Captain Beefheart – Trout Mask Replica
The holy grail of difficulty, an obscure, obtuse puzzle which takes no easy route, panders to no notion of form, consistently hits the opposite note we are trained to hear, and almost BEGS you to hate it. Hey, just about anyone can play “Brown Sugar” or “Norwegian Wood” on the guitar, and to their detriment, frequently do. It takes some serious hang-lows to play any of the tunes on this album. Or record them. Or release them. The musicianship is astonishingly good and original. The human brain is geared to fear and revile that which it cannot immediately process. What greater calling is there than to strive for an expression that triggers that reaction? What more worm-like calling is there than to salve that fear with what is safe and quickly understood? Any great work in any medium; literature, painting, dance, or sculpture, had to spend decades– or even generations– girding against public notions of propriety and the general malaise of the easily satisfied. It’s not unlikely, in forty years, that this album will be burned in the streets by hysterical mobs responding to a decree by the still-living but grimly calcified President Christie.
2. Chrome – Alien Soundtracks
Conceivably the greatest lo-fi album ever recorded, Alien Soundtracks is a total acid/speed mess, a collage of excellent riffs, sci-fi punk, pure sludge, verging-on-amphetamine psychosis, Burroughs-inspired cut up techniques, and inspired fuckoffery. It practically single handedly birthed the 90’s industrial movement. Helios Creed gave a number of interviews around the time of the release of this album in which he seemed to be under the impression that he was a flaming golden lion. He later admitted he’d been eating a lot of blotter. One of my favorite records of all time.
1. Syd Barrett – Madcap Laughs, Barrett
No other album was even considered for the top spot. Without question, this is the most raw, disturbing, and haunting entry on the list. So much so that both solo works had to be included. Syd Barrett left Pink Floyd in 1968 due to mounting instability and lysergic dissolution, but it’s because of his huddling pair of solo albums, Madcap Laughs and Barrett, that he appears here. This is broken music. Lost Thelonius. Way out on the coil. Completely untethered. But it’s also beautiful, transcendent, and truly childlike. The structureless quality of the songs, combined with improvised lyrics and jarring (but somehow perfect) rhythmic changes, tap into something elemental without making any effort to. These songs simply exist. It’s a sound bands have been laboring to achieve for half a century, but only Syd sounds like Syd. And even he only briefly did.

You did some heavy lifting here, my friend.
I’m sure anyone/everyone will have some quibbles, but it’s difficult to complain about anything considering the depth and breadth of your choices (I reckon a detour into Blues would have occupied several more, and of course Reggae is out of the question; or more importantly, most of the musicians would assert –quite rightly– that the herb is not a drug anyway).
My ONE beef is that, however obligatory and cliched, Black Sabbath *has* to be represented. While ‘Master of Reality’ is a no-brainer, one simply can’t leave of ‘Vol 4’, in part b/c the album was almost *named* ‘Snowblind’. And it’s not that they were using drugs (they were) or that the influence of the drugs is palpable (it is), it’s that they managed to ROCK THE EVERLOVING SHIT out of the joint, not remotely debilitated. Of course, they paid a price for that later, but that’s part of the rock and roll code.
All ostensible sins forgiven for having Syd where he belongs: at the top with no one even close to second place. And I say that with sadness, respect and awe.

You’re dead on about Black Sabbath, and the first album made my early list, but had to be culled because…well, I don’t remember now. As you can imagine, this list could easily have been 150 long, so there were some tough cuts. But Ozzy claims to have done acid every day for a year at some point in the late sixties, so it is indeed an oversight…

It might be possible if you have access to enormous quantities. I had a very successful three days in a row once by doubling doses. Two on Friday, four Saturday, and eight Sunday morning just before falling asleep for the first time since Thursday night… I awoke a couple hours later, peaking again and in awe.
But a year? Yeah, the math doesn’t work for doubling. You’d be doing a billion hits at the end of your first month…

A brilliant article. I also found Butthole Surfers – Locust Abortion Technician incredibly haunting. My older brother used to play 22 going on 23 when we were teenagers and it’s echo through my parent’s house was fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. I read that Captain Beefheart recorded some of the material Trout Mask Replica by placing all the musicians in separate booths where they couldn’t hear or see each other.
Fantastic achievement and thoroughly good work. I’ve completely forgotten what I was meant to be working on and I am definitely going to track down McCartney II.

Also Guns and Roses are a bunch of corporate sissies, Syd Barret, 13th floor elevators, and Captain Beefheart were doing heavy shit like DMT. Not that I represent the white mans way of doing it, but it’s some heavy shit and should be respected for unlocking the secrets that were not meant to be known in a world of freebasing coke and doing acid.

I think you’re missing the point a bit. The weirdness of mental effects on drugs does not really get through on any of those artist’s records aside from maybe a technical ability standpoint. I’ll give you Pink Floyd and Thunders (who was mentioned), I guess, but it was the master of LSD tragedy, Barrett himself, who showed them that too much, is too much.

David,
Pink Floyd didn’t do a lot of drugs, contrary to popular belief, other than Syd Barrett. I could see Piper making the list but Barrett gets his on this list with his solo effort. I think Roger Waters has been quoted as saying he smoked some pot during the recording process and that was about it as far as drugs in the band through the 60’s and 70’s.

I have an interview with Roger saying that he took acid twice in the late 60s and 70s. Once, he said, was on a Greek island and it was idyllic and perfect (“I don’t know how much I took”). The second time he was in New York City and he went to a Smiler’s deli for a sandwich and a bottle of milk and, on his way back, he said, he stopped in the middle of the street and didn’t know what to do. That was his last time. The interview was from the early 90s.

Yeah, Packy Axton was dead by 1974 and didn’t have much influence on Stax except for a brief run with the Mar-Keys before getting kicked out of that band. He was a minor player whose mother owned the label. Cropper and Dunn and Jackson and Jones own that Memphis groove, not Axton. Hell, he didn’t even play on the Mar-Key’s biggest hit, “Last Night”. Finally, “Late Night Party” isn’t even an album available during his lifetime. It’s a compilation of mid 60s tracks put together in 2011 and I’m not sure any of them were initially released on Stax. So sure, Packy Axton as a king of 70s Memphis and driving force behind Stax when he released that compilation of non-Stax singles that came out in 2011 after he was dead. Furthermore, the Bobby Fuller Four never released an album called “Let Her Dance”. Seriously, I could fact check your entire article but I don’t have time. Caveat lector.

Something that should’ve been pointed out about the Nilsson/Lennon LP, especially since this is an article about the drugginess of the albums included on the list.
On the front cover, on the floor below Harry & John, you see:
1) A children’s block with the letter “D” on it.
2) A rug.
3) A children’s block with the letter “S” on it.
What does that spell kids?

Peter Perrett of The Only Ones, Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy, Steve Jones of The Sex Pistols, Steve Marriott of Humble Pie, etc.

Exile On Main Street is an obvious choice, but as the best Stones album of all time over Sticky Fingers, Let It Bleed, Beggars Banquet, or even Some Girls or Aftermath? I don’t think so. And Beefheart was taking the piss on Trout Mask Replica, as he said many times afterward. He deliberately set out to make the shittiest album possible, hoping that *exactly* the same people who hail it as a masterpiece would buy into it. Listen to, oh, I don’t know, *anything* else in his catalog if you don’t get that the joke is on fans of the album.

Great list, and I’m not going to chide you for any of your selections. But as for “After Midnight,” your timeline is a bit off. Clapton’s version preceded Cale’s “Naturally” LP by a year (1970). The song itself was known to Clapton, as Cale had released an earlier version during his brief recording career with Liberty Records in mid 60s. Indeed, Cale was about to “give it up” before Clapton had his hit of the song, which helped JJ get signed to Shelter Records.

An enjoyable article, but I have to point out two things. First, I’m a diehard and fanatical Replacements fan and I like “All Shook Down” and listen to it often. It may not be the bestest but I like it plenty. Second and more seriously, in your bit on Neil Young’s “On The Beach” you point out movies and popcorn song references, but that’s the song “Speakin’ Out” which is on the even more drug addled “Tonight’s The Night” which came out a year after “On The Beach”.

That being said, 1994’s Transmissions From The Satellite Heart is one of the best psychedelic albums of all-time.

Agree completely, Middleman. The 1960’s were over, and we lost the Family Stone. You can hear the existential pain of Sly’s broken dream of achieving human harmony through music. Becoming uncomfortably numb as the walls of addiction close around him, battling cynicism, reminding himself that he’s still a songwriter and a poet, and proving it to everyone who will listen with songs of vulnerable beauty like “Smiling”, “Family Affair”, and “Runnin Away”.

One of those lists that you can NEVER get right because people will argue, “How could you include…”, “Why didn’t you include…”, etc. The big problem is how much you got wrong, things you could have easily looked up. Most of them are pointed out in previous response (except that it’s Genya Ravan, not Raven. The list is interesting enough; the rest is someone thrilled by the sound of his own voice and too lazy to do some fact-checking.

The Bobby Fuller/Manson connection is fiction from the book Dead Circus. Manson was in prison in 1966 and had nothing to do with Bobby Fuller or his death. No doubt since there’s a Dead Circus film (been in the works since at least 2010) more people are going to believe this as fact soon. The Manson family did not exist in 1966. It was Bob Keane who suggested that Bobby died at a party and a bunch of celebrities left him in the car to look like suicide which is probably one of the wackiest ideas ever considered.
The Grateful Dead is a big omission. Honestly I’m surprised nobody in the comments mentioned them either. The first album and their early material is really good. The 13th Floor Elevators and the Grateful Dead were the only bands I can think of that were serious about taking LSD and performing on it live back then.
Tommy Hall’s influence in the 13th Floor Elevators is overshadowed by Roky. He wrote a good deal of the songs.

Fun read. I’d think “Dopesmoker” would be an obvious inclusion, but maybe that’s a bit too on the nose. My personal addition would be pretty much anything by Eyehategod – take this anecdote from the recording of “Dopesick”:
Mike Williams had attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process he slashed his hand open badly and bled all over the studio floor (this recording did make it to the record as the introduction to the first track, “My Name is God (I Hate You)”). One of the band members then apparently smeared the words “Hell” and “Death to Pigs” in Mike’s blood.
Also, when I saw them, Mike Williams was too fucked up to sing about a third of the way through, and the drummer was definitely on some serious uppers, because he completely ignored it and kept playing with the biggest most self-satisfied grin ever for about another hour.

I think his fans were, and perhaps his band as well. but you’re right: Rollins was never a drug guy. Too bad. he could’ve made more imaginative music and wouldn’t seem like such a late bloomer to me (come on, he’s my age, but he basically just discovered who John Coltrane and Henry Miller were about 15 years ago? He’s a wanna-be intellectual, but he doesn’t have the insight for it; he’s just got the attention seeking gene.
And many of those faux skinhead types (like boneheaded terrible bands like Agnostic Front et al.) were doing drugs and ranting right wing lyrics. Hardcore is long dead and gone … unless you’re an Austrian skinhead … and still in the closet.

Go back and read it again. It’s about the homoeroticism of hardcore. It doesn’t claim that he was on drugs. I’m not a fan of his writing or his music, but he ran a great record label. And in response to HR: he changed his last name from Garfield in honor of Sonny Rollins, and that was over thirty years ago.

Ha ha! The deadheads feel left out. I am not a fan, but did see them at a 3 day event in Ventura, CA in the late 80’s. I just remember thinking, “This is the last band I would want to hear if I was tripping on acid.” I love psychedelic music, albeit from a different (younger) generation. They sounded like a bunch of old stoned hillbillies to me. The best part of the show was “Space”, where the sound guys tweak a bunch of effects in between sets. I just don’t get it, but I have a better understanding of the power of suggestion and mass hysteria. As for Chrome, I knew Helios when I lived in SF. That MoFo is all kinds of crazy, but a nice guy. I was glad to see him high on the list.

Grateful Dead good live band to trip to says:	
October 29, 2016 at 7:22 pm	
Why the fuck do you call thousands of grown-up people tripping on shrooms and lsd and hearing a psychedelic quality in a certain kind of music a form of mass hysteria instead of mass psychedelia? You could argue any massive congregation of intoxicated persons is a form of hysteria if that’s your attitude.
There is a definite “group” experience at the Dead concerts, but it’s fucking cool. Doesn’t feel hysterical in the least. It’s just peaceful and beautiful and enjoyable. The group experience is based on the combination of tripping hard, letting the music take you for a ride and the unusual reality of being around other fully grown adults tripping their brains out who also happen to be enjoying the music in a similar way you are enjoying it.
There is a sense of bonding with other people for obvious and good reasons. The bonding causes a brotherhood emotion that is powerful enough that people who aren’t tripping can feel it. The psychedelic vibration is so chill that the police and security seem to completely accept the use of drugs and bust zero balls.
Also, it’s the only concert I’ve ever been where the fucking usher to my section started crying because he felt the “mass hysteria” moving him.
I like a lot of Grateful Dead songs, love a few songs, but I had found their style of live jamming fairly boring while sober. When I heard it in the psychedelic state the way my brain translated it was completely different and it was fucking uncanny how the music fit with the drugs.
The long jams seduced and lulled and then the chorus hit, drawing me back in completely, deeply. Often time the chorus had a phrase that hit emotionally. And it sounds more like soulful outerspace music than yodeling hillbillies or whatever pejorative you tossed at them (as if stoned hillbillies are a problem).
Sometimes the Dead will repeat the chorus over and over. This is not something that would stimulate me while sober, but under the influence of psychedelic drugs the repetition has a profundity to it, like they are hammering home the point.
“He’s never coming back” was the chorus that hit me hardest at the Dead and Co. show I saw this summer. It made me think of people who have left Earth who I love. Bob Weir kept saying it and saying it and the melody and the sound was so touching.
That actually made me break down. They’re never coming back. It’s a part of reality. One we don’t fully grapple with…but in a psychedelic mind most people are able to contemplate and feel those profound aspects of life.

But of course, this wouldn’t be the Internet if I didn’t find it inconceivable not to add my two cents. So here it goes. I’d add PIL’s “Second Edition” (AKA “Metal Box”), one of the most drugged out sounding albums in music history, which is no small feat. There were also a cluster of albums in the 80s by out there bands such as 23 Skidoo, Psychic TV, etc., that were hard to listen to — and probably to record! — if one wasn’t on something … something strong.

Also, I know not that many people listen to Phish, but jesus christ… Round Room by Phish is insanely drugged up (As well as Undermind). 3/4 of the band had various drug problems especially Trey (guitar) who was in the midst of being addicted to tons of types of pills and alcohol.

Damn man that is pretty pretentious of you. This list was a person’s opinion… their taste in music. There aren’t any right or wrong answers. (As a few others have mentioned, the only real problem I have were the numerous glaring errors throughout… Not the biggest deal, but it certainly leaves your list feeling a little weak when you notice incorrect “facts” stated about half the albums. I guess that and a few odd choices for certain bands/ artists- like picking Heroes by Bowie… based on your criteria for this list it seems like the obvious choices would be either Station to Station, which you apparently just don’t like but was created by a man stuck in such a depraved state of cocaine addiction that he doesn’t even remember making the album, or probably my pick would be his next album Low. He had just gotten clean when making Low and was clearly fragile and in a unique head space. It just seems odd to choose Heroes instead of Low if you are going for a “detoxed” album. And of course a few other albums such as Young Americans and Diamond Dogs would make fine choices… much better than Heroes. But I digress…
Oh…. also Either/Or by Elliott Smith… that’s an interesting choice.
While I maybe think that’s his best album [maybe], I don’t really see it as his most fucked up druggy one [even with Between the Bars on it, which is one of the absolute greatest songs about addiction]. He really seemed on top of his game at that point. I honestly would almost say any of his others would be better choices for this list than Either/Or, though that’s just my thinking. His first two SOUND the most drug induced to my ears… and he may have actually been using the most [particularly drinking] during his final two albums- not including posthumous releases. And of course he went completely off the rails at the end… after Figure 8 when he wasn’t making any music at all, not successfully anyway… so that time period wouldn’t bring an album to include.
Interesting choice there though. Glad to see you included Elliott, one of my favorites.)
Anyway, wow I have really started to blather. I’m sorry. Back to your comment, I dislike your attitude toward the Brian Jonestown Massacre as well… though I’m sure you aren’t the only one to feel this way. Ohh well. They seem a good choice for the list though. However, I suppose they kind of always sound drugged up… maybe they don’t really fit after all lol. Idk. They are pretty damn original band in my eyes though. Sure they have their influences like anyone else and certainly there are plenty of 60s bands (and more recent) that have had a very prominent impact on their sound, but there is only one BJM. What they do is distinctly them (or him shall I say.) To say that Anton is simply aping others is short-sighted.
And lastly man… I’m confused. What is so confounding about Fleetwood Mac being included here?? Especially to a degree that warranted a verbal attack of this writer? Saying as Fleetwood Mac was a notorious druggy band, (no… not a “cough drop band” or whatever the hell you said. I mean come on man, you are showing your ignorance with a comment like that. It is wise not to comment on something [especially not insult someone] when you are not informed on the subject.) I’d say it is not surprising to see them on the list. And they probably deserve to be on it too, even if their music isn’t always the trippiest or haziest out there. They surely used enough cocaine by the time Tusk came around that it was having a noticeable effect on their music, and especially their live shows.
Shoot Fleetwood Mac has at least one other period of albums that could have been chosen for this list even! I can’t think of which album(s) in particular off the top of my head would be best to include from their earlier drug addled period, but the original blues incarnation of this band was my personal favorite. As much as I love Stevie Nicks, I much preferred the 3 headed beast on guitars of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer. Fuck were they not the most fire blues band in Britain. I think Canned Heat and FM were probably my favorite white-boy blues bands in the late 60s (Cream was too jazzy for me to include in this category. I’m talking some real ass blues.)
Anyway, sometime around the start of the seventies/ end of the sixties, when FM was starting to enjoy some real success, all 3 of their original guitarists were famously dosed with some odd psychedelic at a party in Germany (I think) and either it was way too much or it was some really bad acid or some other relative chemical. All 3 of them were never the same. Basically each became acid casualties from just that one experience, and I highly doubt they were inexperienced trippers.
No one knows what exactly happened that night, but Peter Green’s ego was seemingly obliterated by the trip. He began wearing exotic clothes from Morocco and whatnot, and was in permatrip mode. Started losing interest in playing and no longer wanted any money or royalties. In fact he started giving away all his money, all his possessions. Soon he left the band for good. A few years later he had an episode that involved his generosity. I forget the details exactly, but I believe he pulled a shotgun on somebody (in the band or a manager… I forget who) because he was fed up with people trying to send him checks for all his royalties with the band. I mean this guy was the leader and primary singer/ songwriter, so he no doubt would have had plenty of royalties coming in. He continued to deteriorate after this for many years. I believe he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic after the acid party.
His apprentice at blues guitar, young Danny Kirwan, was also diagnosed schizo after the party. He stuck with the band a couple years longer and sorta took over the leadership role… as a teenager. It took a few years to really start having an effect on him from what I gather, but when it did it hit him hard. Prolonged effects from the trip and intense stress from the work brought on by becoming the primary songwriter and leader of the band started crushing his fragile soul. Began drinking and using a lot, making his emotions frequently more pronounced. This culminated in him flipping out on his bandmates before a gig, leaving the band, and sitting in the audience for the show… to heckle them. Sadly, this little genius musician soon became a homeless addict and stayed that way for much of the next few decades, until he died not too long ago. Danny made little music the rest of his life.
As for Jeremy Spencer, the band’s slide guitar specialist, sometime before Danny left, but I believe after Peter left, just randomly walked out one day only to immediately become a part of some church. From that moment forward he became devoted to the religious group and no longer played in the band. I don’t believe he has really had any lasting issues from the trip, at least not in the way of schizophrenia or anything. He seemed to actually come out relatively unscathed in the end, living a happy religious life. Times were tough for the first few years or so after that fated evening. He was going through bouts of intense mental instability and fighting a breakdown in the time leading up to his departure from the band. Luckily his newfound faith in god seemed to ease his mental problems.
——And I just now realized that I have actually been typing all of this… all this time. Wow… and so this list gets a drug-addled comment now too hahaha! I sorta have a tendency to get a bit long winded when on uppers… sorry everyone. I hope what I have written is at least SOMEWHAT fascinating to some people, and doesn’t come across as a boring, tedious novel written by a robot… which is what I feel like right now lol. Uggghhh.
Well I guess I just felt like spitting this story out for you all (those of you who don’t already know it anyway.) Fleetwood Mac has one of the more fucked up histories of any band that I’m aware of, and their stories are all quite interesting and the thing of legend by now. Keep in mind that this is only a small part of their history… a lot of other crazy shit has happened to them that I haven’t included. I swear this band is both blessed and cursed. While some of the musicians have spent many years living the life of rich millionaire rock stars, jetting around the globe and insufflating literal fortunes worth of high quality cocaine, staying in 5 star hotels, and getting into fun love triangles/ quadrangles, etc… others have had their lives literally ruined while playing in the band. Some have spent their years without so much as a dime living on the street, and some have died young in freak accident. More than one have lost their mind. Oh and that’s just among the guitarists. Suffice to say if there is one band you want to avoid becoming a guitarist for… it is definitely Fleetwood Mac. The position is all around cursed. I don’t believe there is a single guitarist that has played for them since day one that hasn’t had some awful, life changing event happen to them while in the band. Maybe not Lindsay Buckingham (other than potential heartbreak from some of the in-band affairs, and probably experiencing some kind of drug withdrawal a time or three [Not that I feel too bad for someone coming off coke… really not all that big a deal. That being said, I do feel bad for anyone living through an ADDICTION to cocaine. That is a miserable scene, eventually anyway, and I am sure with the amounts of blow he has gone through over the years, he has probably had some pretty bad times.) But he did just leave the band and drama seems to have ensued from that, so who knows what the future still has in store for these people.
So, the main point to take from all this is one I have yet to really even touch on. The Fleetwood Mac everyone is so familiar with, that everyone loves, is kind of a shitty group of people. Not necessarily all of them, and not all around shitty per se. But while the famous core have spent decades in the limelight and have gained the kind of wealth that few musicians have ever known, some of their former bandmates (in particular Danny Kirwan- who led them forward through their transition years, a time in which they easily could have disbanded, and into the beginnings of their famous Rumours period) have lived on the streets for years with mental problems, and these now wealthy old friends and bandmates have not lent any help to the struggling ones. Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine, McVie, Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham… none of them helped get Danny off the streets or filled his wallet before he died. I find this disgraceful. It seems they have done very little for any of the others as well, though the situation with Danny has always really bugged me. Any ONE of them could have gotten him into a nice home and supplied him with enough money to live comfortably for a long time… and STILL be wealthy. And that’s just one of them. For real, they could have easily lent some help, but it seems they chose not to. Now I realize I don’t actually know these people personally, and their could be aspects to their relationships I am unaware of. But fuck! Why couldn’t they help this dude get into a better situation?? He payed his dues. He was an integral part of the group and was a major part of their early and mid successes, as small as they may have been. They would have ceased to exist after Peter Green left if it wasn’t for him. And then there would have been no white-collar, jet setting rock n roll to be had a few years later for the least talented part of the old group and the few new bodies added to the lineup, as they went forward making decidedly mediocre music for the masses.
These people profited off the skills and musical genius of Peter Green and Danny Kirwan (and Jeremy Spencer to a lesser degree.) These guys were the real deal and brought the band a lot of respect early on. They have given this band loads of respectability going forward, even after their sound changed. Peter was the fuckin man. The clear leader at heart even to this day of the band. And Danny, sweet Danny, a mere kid with artistic sensibilities and an understanding of music that ran deep. Peter Green saw his talents and took him under his wing, molding his new protégé into a guitar hero. And guitar heroes they both were.
Anyway, I suppose I will shut the fuck up now… Sheeez. Where has my morning gone? The speed won’t let my mind stopppp! Shit!
I’m not trying to talk massive shit on Fleetwood Mac or anything. I just wish more people knew the story about Danny and how no one was there to help him get back on his feet. The little kid who Jimi Hendrix at one time named as one of his favorite guitarists. Who crafted beautiful songs and had a wicked tone. Ahh and his voice! He was left to wither in the gutter with no one there for him. And by god, he is not the only former bandmember of mega bands to spend decades homeless.
They are the forgotten ones. The never knowns. It makes me so sad…
Anyway, check out some stuff from Fleetwood Mac back in the 60s if you are unfamiliar. There are some g00d videos even on youtube. Early 70s is the period where Danny was the primary songwriter/ vocalist, and led them to a softer, beautiful sound with some amazing songs. Not as notable as the 60s incarnation of the band with Peter Green, but also good.
To me, their music went distinctly downhill the moment Danny left. That’s not to say they have made bad music with Stevie and Lindsay. I actually really like Stevie’s voice and her style (and… well shit just about everything else. I love that girl) and his guitar play aint bad, but all in all the music lost something. It became much more formulaic. And nothing beats the big bad blues of 60s Fleetwood Mac. They kicked serious fucking ass. Rocked god damn hard.
Hey once again thanks for making the list, it was a fun read. And to the guy I started out replying to… I hope I didn’t come across as a jerk, I didn’t really mean to call you out too much or anything. Certainly nothing personal. Just wanted to get some things off my mind.
And sorry I turned my reply into this huge wall of text. I feel a fool. Read it/ don’t, I understand completely either way. Hopefully somebody will stumble upon 60s Fleetwood Mac for the first time now after reading this. If so…. fucking enjoy! Same goes to all of you who are already familiar with the music and decide to dip back in for a little refresher. It’s so easy to forget about Peter Green and what they were doing back then. Seems no one ever talks about them…
Anyway, Peace out all

A fun list and a reminder (as Bill Hicks was wont to point out) that drugs have always played a crucial role in the creation of some of the best moments in music history. A minor quibble with the Joy Division (epilepsy and depression?) and Rollins (caffeine?) inclusions. If the list was slightly longer I’d imagine some Chet Baker, Nick Cave representation (Prayers On Fire), Flaming Lips (Hear It Is), MC5 (High Time), and something from the krautrock canon where albums were cut from improvised studio jams fueled by speed and acid (Cosmic Jokers). A fun read and thanks for reminders of so many great albums to go back and re-listen to.

If the criteria are “desperation” and “bleeding chemical influence” as the writer says, some ideas:
Yes (in spades): #48, #43, #33 (should rank higher), #32, #31, #5.
No: #46 (worship the ’Mats, but album makes me happy for some reason) #12 (ok, more folks need to hear Trans, but Tonight’s IS desperation), #9 (too obvious AND its Fleetwood Mac), #6 (seems writer incl. this to brag abt. gng. to 3 Rollins shows. I saw them as a 15yo—their music doesn’t bleed chem influence to me @ ALL).
Missing: The Birthday Party (!!!), Spiritualized, Marianne Faithfull, Broadcast, early Floyd (thx for putting Syd at #1 tho).
Gonna get: Frusciante’s first, McCartney II, #25.
Thank you for this list—and the opp to share my humble opinion(s).

Excellent list. There was is no way to create a “list”, and make it unanimously “correct”, as the pundits encounter with every list ever compiled. I applaud the list and the effort it took to put it together. I could not have done any better, though my additions would be:
Grateful Dead (either of the first two records). The first two records were the definition of drug-riddled, and the band was, by ’68, heavily in to experimentation as a device.
Pink Floyd (Obscured By Clouds, or Ummagumma). I understand why Floyd was ommitted, but I would have opted for inclusion, for obvious reasons.
Monster Magnet (Tab 25, or either of the first two records). Dave Windorf has NEVER shied away from his stance on drugs and in fact has stood proudly at the mantle of his pipe and process. If EVER there was a band/record riddled with drugs, in every way, it is Magnet.
Coltrane (actually, several other jazz greats) could make this list.
I do NOT agree with including G.G. All in, as others have mentioned. While homeboy was one of the poster children for why NOT to do drugs, I don’t believe his music is anywhere near the level of the other musicians and records on this list. It’s super easy to find junkie musicians, but to find junkie musicians who released definitive music is more difficult to do. I don’t think it was about finding the biggest junkie, rather finding the biggest and BEST drug riddled records and artists.

Your research on Bobby Fuller seems to be limited to a novel published several years ago, in which a character with his name appears. At the time of his death, the Manson Family didn’t exist and Bobby himself had little interest in drugs, so it’s hard to see how he made this list. The “acid party” theory regarding Fuller’s death, put forth by his manager Bob Keane, has been proven to be pure speculation by Keane, nothing more.

disagree about aerosmith — draw the line sounds way diff. than toys or rocks — guitars are lazier, whiskey soaked, defeated, tyler’s drug inferences and lyrics more sleazy — his voice sounds shot- the record sounds totally uninhibited and flying off the tracks
also tusk is more cocaine riddled then rumours — buckingham’s paranoid fast numbers and songs with only choruses, no verses mixed ,with mcvie’s super slow ballads
As people mentioned, where’s Zep — Physical Graffiti is total opium, the drums, the guitars,and on Presence Page just plays wasted
Sly Stone on There’s a riot — totally wasted, half the words are mumbled and super dark
Ever hear Kate Bush The Red Shoes? Awesome album, sounds like a Marijuana trip

How you missed “Dirt” by Alice in Chains is beyond me. Then having “Madcap Laughs” at number 1 shows you sort of know what you’re talking about, but have read the wrong books.
Syd was insane and likely would have been insane regardless of the drugs he abused. That’s common knowledge among most PF scholars.
I don’t think I saw Appetite For Destruction either? Sorry, the list has some great albums to listen to, but to leave those two off and have Madcap as #1 is showing some seriously subjective writing.

great list! happy Eddie Hazel’s album made it on there. You really are missing “The Pod” by Ween though, that would be near the very top for me. Also I expected at least one “The Boredoms” albums; “Pop Tatari,” “Onanie Bomb meets the Sex Pistols” or even “Super AE”

You have totally omitted the Reggae genre. True, it’s (most of the time) “only” pot Reggae artists are dealing with, but some of them are true junkies. And from time to time you stumble upon the ultimate tropical crackhead, as Jamaica has been a cocaine heaven for 35 years or so now…
For instance, Gregory Isaacs’ “Night Nurse” is not about some woman taking care of Gregory. It is about coke. Gregory Isaacs so didn’t care and was so far gone that he was capable of lighting his crack pipe during meetings at Island Records with Chris Blackwell…
But to get back to ganja, here is a quick selection that serious Reggae fans will no doubt add to
Bob Marley – Kaya
Peter Tosh – Legalize it
Horace Ferguson – Sensi Addict
Mighty Diamonds – Pass the Koutchie
Toots & the Maytals – Pass the Pipe
Sugar Minott -Herbman Hustling
the number of pot-related songs, of Sensi Dub, Kaya Dub, Herb Dub, etc… is simply staggering

Any list of drug-addled albums is incomplete without Velvet Acid Christ. I prefer Fun With Knives http://www.amazon.com/Fun-Knives-Velvet-Acid-Christ/dp/B00000ID37
Definitely not reggae and just look at the tracklist:
1. Decypher
2. The Dark Inside Me
3. There Is No God
4. Icon
5. Fun With Drugs
6. Speedball O.D.
7. Psycho
8. Slut
9. Apflux
10. Fun With Knives
11. Caught
12-66. [Untitled]
It does not disappoint.

After reading your criteria, I guess I can understand omitting Mötley Crüe, although I think the tone and lyrics on the Girls, Girls, Girls album smack o f smack. But to leave Alice in Chains’ “Dirt” off the list is insane. I suggest listening to their early demos, then going back to “Dirt.” The change in sound, let alone the lyrics to half the songs on that album, show the influence of heavy drugs. The fact that it is a GREAT album should earn it a Top 10 nod. (Pun intended)

Ministry´s albums “Filth Pig” & “Dark Side Of The Spoon” should be the top slots!
Al Jourgensen(Ministry) started shooting Cocaine at 13(1971′), was locked up an entire year at a mental institution at 15, after taking Acid and thinking the teachers were insects. Had a Crackpipe built into his Mic-Stand and always a bottle of bushmills Whiskey with 5 hits of Acid in it on stage.
Beating these references/Father Figures is quite hard too:
He lived with Dr.Timothy Leary for two years, paying rent by being his Guinea Pig, trying new sorts of Acid every week. He also lived with and was great friends with William Burroughs. Alien used Crack+Heroin daily for 22years(plus every other drug that came in his way)..
By 2003 he had been:
Legally declared dead three times, had Hep A,B, and C, liver failure, kidney failure, stomach failure(Ulcers), had a big toe and half his foot removed surgically after getting Gang Green by breaking a needle in the toe, forgetting he did it and then walking on it for 5 weeks without noticing(or taking his boots off). Had his entire left arm cut open to get infection away, almost loosing the entire arm.
This guy is the real deal, even Lemmy has stated that “Jourgensen is the heaviest druguser of all musicians”. Read his Biography, it´s as fun as it´s horrifying: “Ministry: The Lost Gospels Of Al Jourgensen”
Like the Ministry song says “Just One Fix”..

finally, someone, while discoursing on the topic of drug-fueled music, mentions the legendary pink dots…i suppose it would have been a step too far in the same direction to have mentioned the tear garden, or rx, or download. my one smirky elitist disagreement was with your assessment of locust abortion technician as being the most terrifying album ever recorded…that would likely be either dry lungs I compilation, or pretty much any very early nurse with wound or current 93. but the daring us to listen to kunts at midnight alone etc. part? i dare you to have your first LSD experience be having someone you trust seat you in front of a strobe light in a dark room on about 10 or 11 hits of very incredibly good acid, and play throbbing gristle’s hamburger lady followed by their very friendly at high volumes. terrifying? psht!

pity the lack of Led Zep, Sabbath, YES. pity the lack of hip hop, and much else.
two things i assumed would make the list but didnt:
Bitches Brew has no place here, especially given that Davis’ last 2 albums before retiring for 6 years (Agharta and Pangaea) were recorded the morning and evening of one single very druggy day in Japan in 1975. most saliently, the Japanese release of Pangaea i bought has an extra long version of the final track, Gondwana. that 46 minutes of brain-melting DMT funk is followed by 3.5 extremely druggy minutes of a wasted Miles twiddling knobs by himself in what sounds like Trent Reznor on a Salvia overdose. after hearing THAT, 6 years of recovery and a be-boppy neoconservativish return sounds exactly right.
oh, and the first John Coltrane record i ever heard was “OM” at age 16, and it very much sounds like they are all on acid…i mean seriously, doing exactly the sort of extended, obsessive instrumental experimentation that’s well beyond “Free Jazz” and totally in the realm of what you would expect a bunch of avant-jazz masters to sound like *if they all dropped a whole lot of acid*, let it reach a peak, and then turned the recording equipment on.
according to Nat Hentoff and others, the widely noted jazz industry rumor was precisely that…they were all on a lot of acid. surprised not to see it here.

I’m very late to this party. Came upon the list while trying to remember a Billie Holiday album where she sounds drugged, drunk, or both. It’s not the one in this list, however. As I recall, it was a live concert recording.
Rundgren’s A Wizard, A True Star also came to mind for me. And, regarding the suggestion of Sgt. Pepper’s, maybe the White album would be a better choice.
Anyway, great list…and great job on compiling.

i like the list, or at least the idea of it, but the criteria used remain a bit murky. when it comes to debauchery some more of the old jazz men certainly should’ve been included, as well as oasis (be here now). and like one of the readers i agree that stoner rock (sabbath or one of the later bands like electric wizard) cannot be omitted. i like the fact you included legendary pink dots. maybe in a similar vein bands you wouldnt expect it from should have been added, like the triffids and the g-betweens, and even the kinks. oh, and before we forget nick cave and einsturzende neubauten made some pretty debauched sounds early in their career… still, a nice list!

Bravo!!! I’m thoroughly uninterested in the bickering about what should and shouldn’t have been included here. (Why does that always happen? IDIOTS!) What I am interested in is your brilliant, insightful, often hilarious, always clever synopses of these records. In the cases of the records I know, I agree with much of what you wrote. As for those I don’t, well, I’m that much more inclined to hear them now. Thanks so much for that! (BTW, personally, I think this is a pretty damn great Top 50 list. I would take issue with very few of your selections. I can’t imagine it being much better overall.)

Great list, must of got you a lot of time and effort to sort out and choose…the reason that i’m commenting is Alice in chains.Their second lp “dirt” must be one of the most harrowing ,honest,bleak and straightforward accounts of what being a drug addict really is(heroin being the the main d.o.c.).If you also add to that some facts, like that it hit number 1 spot of the billboard top 200 chart the first week of it’s release ,with songs like “junkhead” “godsmack” “sickman” on it, that everyone on the band at the time was on a daily heroin+crack habits(layne staley was actually shooting up dope in the studio in front of the others band members,which actually freaked out their producer cause everyone elses was very cool bout it ) and last but not least the singer layne staley died of a speedball o.d. in 2002.I think “dirt” is the one most sincere ,truthful and close to what it really feels like for someone to be addicted to heroin.

Making Your 990 Work for You
by GuideStar, on 2/3/03 8:00 AM

Do governmental forms give you the willies? Does preparing or reviewing your organization's IRS Form 990 strike terror into your heart? Don't despair. All you need is a little assistance and a new way to look at the forms.
Donors and grantmakers are coming to GuideStar in droves to see your information, so you want to get the most out of your 990. Don't think of it as just a financial reporting form—instead, look at it as one more way you can communicate effectively with these audiences. You can also provide context for these data by updating your organization's report page.
Here are some tips for getting the most out of your organization's 990:
Share the form with your marketing, development, and communications officers
If your accountant and chief executive officer are typically the only people in your organization who pay much attention to your 990, now is the perfect time to share this document with your marketing, development, and communications officers as well. They can help write clear narratives that add the much-needed context to the pages of 990 financials.
Use the correct form
The Form 990 has changed over the years, so be sure to use the correct version for the year for which you are filing. Don't use software that includes more lines than the actual 990 requires. Some programs have a line 43f, which is not part of the form.
Protect your organization's address when necessary
If your organization engages in work that protects the location of at-risk individuals (i.e., a battered women's shelter), do not put the actual address of your organization on the 990. Instead, use your mailing address or P.O. box.
Contributors, donors, and government grants are not public information
Line 1d information is now shown on Schedule B and is clearly marked "not open for public inspection." For Schedule A, Part IV-A, lines 26b, 27a, and 28, you are required to prepare a written list of contributions relevant to these lines in case it is requested by the IRS, but you are no longer required to attach it to your Form 990. If you sprinkle this confidential information anywhere else in your return, you run a high risk of having it inadvertently released to the public.
Get the most out of Part III, your Statement of Program Service Accomplishments
What is your organization's primary/exempt purpose? This is your mission statement. Don't let your accountant determine this. It should be concise (not a lengthy narrative), but it doesn't have to fit into the small space provided on the document itself. You can refer readers to an attached statement. If you refer readers to an attachment, on this line put: SEE STATEMENT 1.
Describe your exempt-purpose achievements, both measurable and not measurable. This section supports your mission statement and gives you an opportunity to describe specific accomplishments. A supporting program service expense must follow each listing, so this section should include broad, well-explained categories.
Don't include Social Security Numbers
The Social Security number of your Form 990 preparer, although a field on the 990, is not required when filing. Instruct your form preparer to leave it off if he/she does not want the Social Security number released to the public. Also, don't include Social Security numbers for any other persons you identify on the form.
If you make scholarship, fellowship, or research grants to individuals, you are required to list them individually by name, address, and amount given, unless your organization is subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. You are not, however, required to provide the recipients' Social Security numbers. Also, if you are reporting specific assistance to individuals on Line 23, you are not required to provide names and addresses.
Round your numbers
Round numbers to the nearest dollar. There is no need to use decimal points.
Don't leave blanks
An absence of information where it is required will create questions in many readers' minds. In general, fill in all the blanks, especially where you need to total various lines. Also, keep in mind that the IRS requires Parts II and VII to be filled out in the exact format, using the same categories, as specified on the form. Many organizations submit attachments that stray from the format.
Do not put more than one number in any box
Do not include bank account numbers on your 990
Protect the privacy of your officers, directors, trustees, and key employees
Although these people need to be identified by name and address, the address listed should be where they receive company mail, not necessarily their home addresses. That means that board members do not have to include their home addresses in this section.
Remember that Form 2758, Application for Extension of Time To File, is also a public document
It takes a little time to do it right. And the payoff is fabulous: donors and grantmakers will be reading accurate, engaging information about your good work.
There, now. Feeling better about tackling that form?

Creed | Крид
Мало какой другой парфюмерный бренд имеет столь давнюю и славную историю, как лондонская марка Creed, созданная еще в 1760-м году.
Прошло всего лишь несколько лет после создания компании, а она уже стала эксклюзивным партнером по поставкам парфюмерии при дворе Ее Величества королевы Виктории!
Переехав в 1854-м году в Париж, Creed новыми силами стал наращивать свое влияние на рынке модной парфюмерии, оставаясь живой легендой и по сей день.
За время своего существования торговый дом Крид выпустил более 200 парфюмов, каждый из которых отличал свой неповторимый характер и непревзойденное качество.
Сплетая в настоящее время воедино классические традиции английской и французской моды, парфюмеры Крид демонстрируют недосягаемые стандарты и ставят высочайшую планку для всех, кто принял решение производить парфюмерию.
Стоит отметить, что Creed владеет собственным ноу-хау в приготовлении ингредиентов для своих изысканных парфюмов, содержащих, кстати, наибольшее количество веществ натурального происхождения среди всех парфюмерных компаний мира.
Купить духи Creed (Крид) вы можете в нашем интернет-магазине с доставкой по Москве, Санкт-Петербургу, России. Мы делаем скидку 5% за 2 любых парфюма Крид.

Элитная парфюмерия Creed (Крид)
Creed (Крид) - элитный торговый дом парфюмерии, основанный в 1790 году Джеймсом Генди Кридом, который своим непревзойденным мастерством в области создания ароматов снискал расположение не только богемной элиты Англии, но и самой королевы Виктории.
Торговый дом Крид являлся официальным поставщиком элитной парфюмерии для всего королевского двора, а в 1854 году, при содействии французской императрицы Евгении, Джеймс Генри Крид переехал в столицу парфюмерного искусства - Париж.
При поддержке королевского дома парфюмерия Крид приобрела статус эксклюзивной и люксовой, а духи Крид приобрели известность во всей Европе.
Торговый дом Крид до сих пор является семейным бизнесом (и это спустя 6 поколений), передавая по наследству секреты производства парфюмерных композиций.
За 200 лет существования парфюмерия Creed может похвастаться около 200 различными ароматами, популярные ароматы Крид смог удовлетворить самые взыскательные парфюмерные вкусы.
Духи Крид изготавливаются исключительно из натуральных ингредиентов, все компоненты отбираются в ручную, а флаконы бренда достойны высших похвал.
Creed - парфюмерия с 200-летней историей
Две сотни лет назад купить духи Creed могли только представители дворянских семей, или высокопоставленные лица, приближенные к царскому двору.

Торговый дом Creed (Крид)
Creed - это один из старейших парфюмерных домов Британии, выпускающий эксклюзивные, нишевые ароматы. С момента своего образования и по сегодняшний день эта компания чтит свои традиции, а секреты парфюмерного мастерства хранятся в семье основателей бренда и передаются из поколения в поколение.
История легендарной марки началась в шестидесятых годах восемнадцатого века, когда химик из Англии Джеймс Генри Крид разработал свой первый парфюм. Изначально он не рассчитывал на широкое признание и успех своего творения, так как полагал, что составление аромата – это настоящее искусство, и на создание подлинного шедевра надо потратить много времени.
Тем не менее, очень скоро дебютная композиция новоявленного парфюмера стала пользоваться такой сумасшедшей популярностью, что он решил открыть собственную лабораторию и всерьез заняться производством духов.
Через какое-то время Крид стал получать заказы на изготовление уникальных, неповторимых парфмов от самых знатных европейских домов, в том числе от королевских дворов Англии и Франции, которые по достоинству оценили изысканные качественные ароматы.
Ведь все свои творения парфюмер создавал исключительно из наиболее ценных и редких компонентов, которые наделяли духи Creed хорошей стойкостью и восхитительным благоуханием.
В ту эпоху почетными клиентами дома Creed были такие известные личности, как французский император Наполеон III, королева Испании Мари́я Кристи́на де Бурбо́н, император России Николай II, принцесса Баварии Елизавета Австрийская. Перечислять имена знаменитых людей, которые были поклонниками парфюмерии Creed можно было бы очень долго, так как и тогда, и сейчас спрос на духи этой компании всегда больше предложения.
По прошествии многих лет потомок выдающегося Джеймса Генри Крида, взялся за возрождение былой славы парфюмерного бренда. По древним рецептурам, которые сохранила его семья, он воспроизвел некоторые особо удачные парфюмы. Все композиции создавались вручную из самых качественных природных ингредиентов, которые были специально куплены на цветочных плантациях Франции.
В настоящее время ароматы нишевой марки Creed изготавливаются на французских предприятиях, и по праву считаются одними из лучших в мировой парфюмерной промышленности. Специалисты компании не перестают удивлять своих почитателей новыми шедеврами «алхимического» творчества, которые славятся элегантными, изысканными композициями и безупречным качеством исполнения.
В ассортименте марки представлено около семидесяти роскошных духов для мужчин и женщин. Среди наиболее популярных ароматов, можно выделить фруктово-цветочный парфюм «Angelique Encens», которому отдавала предпочтение знаменитая актриса и певица Марлен Дитрих.
Также особого внимания заслуживает мужская туалетная вода «Creed Tabarome», созданная на базе зеленого чая и табака, специально для заядлого курильщика Уинстона Черчилля. Не мене интересны воздушные, жизнерадостные духи «Creed Jasmal», разработанные для неотразимой и женственной Одри Хепберн, а также роскошный и элегантный аромат «Creed Royal Water», предназначенный для принцессы Дианы.
Сегодня во главе дома Creed стоит шестой представитель английского рода парфюмеров Оливье Крид. Он не только поддерживает бренд на плаву и занимается его развитием, но и сам разрабатывает ароматические шедевры. Оставаясь верным традициям компании, Оливье с большим вниманием относится к мельчайшим деталям изготовления парфюмов и строго следит за их составом.
Тщательный подбор компонентов и ручной труд, который используется при создании ароматов, делают духи Creed раритетными и исключительными. Их любят и ценят за их высочайшее качество и натуральность.
Конечно, цена на ароматы Creed не маленькая, однако истинные парфюмерные эстеты знают, что по-настоящему хорошая, эксклюзивная композиция стоит потраченных на нее денег. Вот почему изумительную продукция марки, которая выпускается в ограниченном количестве, выбирают парфюмерные гурманы и высокопоставленны особы, знающие толк в нишевых духах.
Преданными поклонниками продукции Creed являются такие звезды кино, как Джулия Робертс, Кевин Костнер, Жерар Депардье.
Порадовать себе восхитительной парфюмерий Creed, которая объединила в себе королевскую роскошь и благородство, Вы сможете в интернет-бутике парфюмерии Unifive.ru.
У нас в каталоге представлен широчайший спектр композиций этого бренда по самым выгодным ценам. Среди такого многообразия Вы наверняка найдете свой неповторимый аромат, который подчеркнет Вашу яркую индивидуальность.

Словарь терминов
Тестер
это демонстрационный вариант аромата, который прилагается производителями к партии товара с целью рекламы на месте продажи. Тестер не имеет никаких отличий (качество аромата, стойкость и т.д.) от варианта для продажи. Разница лишь в том, что тестеры выпускаются с целью рекламы и фирма-производитель не столь бережно относится к их оформлению. Тестеры часто имеют более простой флакон, как правило, это большой спрей-пульверизатор без крышки и предлагаются Вам в так называемой технической упаковке, простой коробке, отличной от той, в которой выпускаются флаконы для продажи.
Винтаж (раритет)
старинную вещь, которая была актуальна в эпоху ее создания, отражающая стиль и дух своего времени. В XXI веке винтажными считаются парфюмерные композиции, которые были произведены и стали хитами в разные десятилетия XX века. Не созданы, а именно произведены. Например, Chanel №5, которая сейчас стоит на полках магазинов, была создана в 1921 году, но тот флакон, который вы купите там же, в магазине, был выпущен на заводе год - полтора назад. К винтажной (раритетной) парфюмерии относят и те духи, которые были сняты с производства по различным причинам. Зачастую основная - это значительная стоимость компонентов: натуральные амбра, мускус, цветочные абсолюты, пряности стоят баснословных денег.
Духи (Parfum, Extrait)
содержат 18-30 % ароматических веществ, это самые концентрированные и стойкие парфюмерные изделия.
Парфюмированная вода
или туалетные духи (Eau de Parfum, Parfum de Toilette) содержит 10-20 % ароматических веществ. Хорошо сохраняют аромат в течение 4-6 часов.
Туалетная вода (Eau de Toilette)
легкий вид парфюмерии, в котором ярко звучат верхние и средние ноты. Концентрация ароматической композиции 8-10% Туалетная вода предназначена для использования несколько раз в день, и подходит для применения в течение рабочего дня.
Одеколон (Eau de Cologne)
самый легкий вид парфюмерии. Назначения и свойства у одеколона такие же, как и у туалетной воды, но концентрация ароматических веществ еще меньше—3-8% в 70-80% спирте.
Атомайзер
флакон с пневматическим устройством для разбрызгивания, спрей. В оригинальных флаконах спрей обычно запаян. В атомайзерах спрей всегда завинчивающийся. Сейчас атомайзером стали называть не только устройство для распыления духов, а полностью весь флакон с содержимым.
Запаска (refill)
это запасной блок, т.е. дополнительная емкость с тем же самым ароматом. В зависимости от производителя запаска может быть со спреем или без спрея с завинчивающейся крышкой (в 70% случаев). Иногда запаска представляет собой емкость, которую необходимо вставить в "нарядный" футляр. По качеству содержимого запаска ничем не отличается от стандартного флакона, но цена ее намного ниже из-за более простого оформления и зачастую отсутствия спрея.
Миниатюра
флакон, объемом не более 10 мл, полностью копирующий основные флаконы, но часто без спрея.
Селективная парфюмерия
(также известна как «нишевая») – это противоположность широко известным, массовым торговым маркам. Как правило, владельцы селективных брендов не вкладывают огромных средств в рекламу, продвижение своих товаров и дизайн. Парфюмерия селективных брендов почти всегда более сложная, используются в ней, преимущественно, натуральные компоненты.
Гробики
прямоугольные флаконы парфюмерии от Serge Lutens в экспортном варианте. Надо заметить, что ароматы Serge Lutens продающиеся в Париже, среди парфюмерных фанатов называют "колокольчики" (из-за флаконов, напоминающих колокольчики по форме и круглой крышечки).
Отливант
это небольшой объем парфюма, от 5 до 20 мл, отлитый в отдельную емкость–атомайзер, миниа­тюрный стеклянный флакончик со спреем.
Роллер
(от англ. - roller или roll-on, ролик)-флакон работает по принципу роликового дезодоранта и шариковой ручки. Шарик крутится, попеременно контактируя с содержимым и внешней средой.
Стоппер
(от англ. - stopper, пробка) — крышка, изпользуемая на флаконе (не спрей), затычка. Стопперы бывают стеклянные или пластиковые.
Трёхступенчатое развитие аромата
способ построения парфюма во французской парфюмерной школе. Восприятие аромата в динамике в течение времени.
Начальная нота
это первое впечатление.
Нота сердца
главная в букете аромата.
Конечная нота
завершающая стадия в раскрытии духов, обеспечивает силу и стойкость аромата.
Тестер (tester) – отличается неподарочной упаковкой и не отличается по содержимому, выпускаются торговыми домами ограниченными тиражами в целях ознакомления в сетевых магазинах и экономии на подарочной упаковке.
Важно: большинство тестеров выпускаются без колпачка и упаковываются в картонные коробки.
Атомайзер – это флакон, объемом от 5 до 20мл, содержащий оригинальный аромат, отлитый из большого флакона. Ничем не отличается по качеству и имеет стильный дизайн.
Парфюмерия в атомайзере очень удобна в использовании благодаря своей компактности, прочности и защиты от нежелательного распыления. А также незаменима в поездках, в особенности при авиаперелетах, так как допустима для транспортировки в ручной клади.
Отливант-спрей - маленький флакон со спреем, содержащий 1 мл оригинальной парфюмерии, перелитой из большого флакона.
Предназначен для тестирования аромата, содержимого хватает на 2-3 дня использования.
Пробник - маленький сосуд объемом 1мл - 2.5мл, содержащий образец аромата, предназначенный для ознакомления.
В частоте случаев оснащен рекламным буклетом с описанием аромата.
Варианты пробников:
спрей — небольшой флакончик с пульверизатором;
пробирка с пластиковой палочкой;
роллер — маленький флакончик с роликом наверху;
флаконы с винтовой крышкой.

The Fulford File | Immigration And Michael Medved’s Ellis Island Fever

Talk show host and columnist Michael Medved is a neoconservative in the literal sense of being a former liberal. (An ad for his biography says “Michael Medved has taken an extraordinary journey from liberal activist to outspoken conservative.” Well, maybe it’s not that extraordinary.)
Which means that while he may now support the American side in foreign wars, and be on the side of law in the fight against crime, he maintains some of the liberal beliefs of his upbringing—above all with regard to immigration.
That being the case, it’s easy for him to get a gig at the liberal Daily Beast sniping at ordinary conservatives, saying things like “The GOP Self-Destructs.” [October 19, 2011]
His latest effusion for the Daily Beast is indicative of this. Packaged by the Beast’s editors as GOP DISCORD, it insists that Republicans have to stop talking about immigration, because it’s not important.
This is what Medved’s Marxist former friends (or is that former Marxist friends?) call writing into the “optative mood”—i.e. if you say something loudly enough, it might come true…or at least you might bully people into thinking it’s true. Other, more objective, MSM observers have expressed surprise at just how important the immigration issue has actually turned out to be: see Immigration debate intensifies in GOP race, by Steve Peoples, SFGate, October 20, 2011; Why immigration won’t go away in 2012, by Ed Kilgore, Salon, October 24, 2011.
But in Stop Harping on Immigration![October 24, 2011] Medved claims:
“With Rick Perry suddenly pushing a flat tax and Herman Cain substantively revising his popular 9-9-9 revenue plan, GOP candidates may finally relinquish their feverish immigration obsession—one that’s destructive, distracting, demented, and downright dumb.”
[Links in original]
Medved’s argument: people aren’t interested, as shown by polls where they’re asked to name what’s important to them—they don’t say “immigration”:
“Actually, no major poll of the last year—no, not one of them—showed robust public interest in immigration. This month, CBS News asked respondents to name “the most important problem facing this country today.” Less than 2 percent came up with “illegal immigration,” while a dozen other concerns, led by “the economy and jobs,” of course, finished higher on the list. Over the summer, surveys from Bloomberg and Fox News found 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, who identified immigration as a priority, with gas prices, the war in Afghanistan, health care, the deficit, education, and even nebulous concerns like “partisan politics” and “moral values” more frequently mentioned by the public.”
Two points here:
Actually, very few stand-alone issues break double digits in this type of polls. A Gallup poll in September showed “immigration” at just 4%— compared to just 7% for healthcare, 4% with education, and 3% for "War/ Wars", all of which get many times the MSM attention. "Taxes" came in at a mere 2%. Only four issues got above 10%.
And these tend to be economic issues—but immigration is the economy.
As I’ve said before, you see people saying, in effect “Let's not talk about immigration, let's talk about THE ECONOMY”. But they forget that immigration is the economy in the sense that millions of foreigners are being invited in to share in it. And even more than that it's the jobs issue, since that's really what the immigrants are being invited to share in.
It works like this:
People are concerned about jobs? Immigrants take jobs.
People are concerned about spending? Immigrants receive spending.
People are concerned about “health care, the deficit, education…”? All of them made worse by immigrants.
I think that leaves only the War in Afghanistan (started by immigrants on 9/11) and “moral values”—immigrants have different ones from Americans.
But it’s Medved’s language that stands out. Here, I’ve separated out the chunks of spittle-spattered sentiment from whatever minimal arguments go with them. They include:
"feverish immigration obsession"
"destructive, distracting, demented, and downright dumb"
"wildly disproportionate"
"toxic trash talk"
"attack ads that are already polluting the Internet,"
"dire worries"
"impassioned activists"
"border-guarding vigilantes"
"immigration hardliners"
"angry resistance"
"baleful experience"
"ranting against illegals"
"20-foot-high fence with deadly electrical current"
"inflammatory and pointlessly divisive tone"
Links added. All of which is the typical, highly emotive language of the Left. But it’s also the language of the neoconservative—who thinks that other people are getting too partisan and excited. All that’s missing is the word “screed.”
And what causes this is, not a rational analysis of the political situation, but what we at VDARE.com think of as “Ellis Island Fever.” That is, believing that modern immigrants are just like your grandfather, and that anyone who wants to keep them out is the same as the people who wanted to keep your grandfather out.
Of course, this is only the case if your grandfather was a Mexican carpenter, which not so with Medved.
Americans are on to this. A reader sent us a letter describing an encounter between Heather Mac Donald and Wall Street Journal immigration enthusiast Jason Riley on the Medved Show:
“Of course, Medved [email him] (whom I used to like, but who has morphed into one of the most vicious and arrogant neocon pundits) made no pretense of objectivity, but ganged up with Riley to attack and belittle virtually everything Mac Donald said. When Mac Donald stated that Hispanics in general displayed certain social pathologies (crime, out-of-wedlock births, multi-generational poverty) Riley claimed the opposite, citing statistics (apparently a major theme in his book) to show that illegals were incarcerated at lower rates than native born citizens and that 85% of Hispanic children are in two-parent homes. Mac Donald was unable to counter these points (as I believe she could have, with a more nuanced and careful analysis of the relevant stats and categories). Medved also jumped in—in a very insinuating ‘if you say yes it means you're a racist’ way—by demanding Mac Donald answer his questions, ‘Are you [actually] saying there is something wrong with Hispanic culture? And are you [Oh, the horror!] against legal Hispanic immigration?‘
After a long, pregnant silence, Mac Donald crumpled, and choked out a pathetic, defeated, ‘No...but statistics suggest...,’ and was quickly cut off by Medved. I could tell she wanted to make the ethno/cultural argument against mass Hispanic immigration, both legal and illegal, but she lost her nerve or didn't have it in the first place.
To give her some credit, Mac Donald did say, responding to Riley's assertion that the market should determine immigration levels, that a nation is more than just a big labor exchange. But she failed to develop this point, as she failed overall to make a strong case against illegal immigration or for reducing legal immigration. “
[Heather Mac Donald Debates Jason Riley Limply On Medved Show, June 22, 2008]
Another reader listened to the same show and reported
“The question he asked her, that caused such a long pause, was (paraphrasing) ‘would Mac Donald prefer an unskilled laborer from Taiwan over one such from Mexico’. Why not admit that the Taiwanese culture is probably more capable of assimilating in the U.S. since his children will be more likely to appreciate the value of education than the Mexican immigrants have shown themselves to be.
Medved is simply a dishonest jerk when callers try to voice concern about this concern.”
Medved is also the author of In defense of birth-right citizenship [January 3, 2006] in which he said that not allowing illegals to steal citizenship for the children was ‘sending an ugly, destructive message.’ In another 2006 column, written during the Amnesty Wars, he used phrases like “hysterical charges by fringe groups” and “the nativist fringe may combine with die-hard Bush-bashers” [Immigration surprise: broad agreement, not polarization, July 19, 2006]
(Note that, despite that optative mood headline, amnesty failed).
I once told the story here of hearing a motivational speaker say
“For years, I heard people saying 'Money isn't everything.' Or 'Money isn't important,' and I had actually managed to convince myself of this. However, I discovered that my creditors had it right up there with oxygen on their list of priorities.”
Well, for someone who claims immigration is a “side issue” that “doesn’t really divide” the GOP candidates, and that “few voters consider a top priority”, it’s obvious that immigration is right up there with oxygen on Medved’s list of priorities.
But he never says why. The explanation: “Ellis Island Fever.”
Medved should take a stress pill and go lie down.

Deconstructing Rosé: Simplicity is Complicated
February 19, 2019 By Mike Veseth in The Next Big Thing, wine, wine markets	1 Comment
“Here in France, restaurant wine lists now have a separate rosé section. And this is not confined to Provence … The world seems to have gone pink, perhaps one small sign of an increasing desire for simplicity when we sit down to eat and drink.”
(Peter Mayle, My Twenty-Five Years in Provence, 2018 – emphasis added.)
The world does seem to have gone pink, as Peter Mayle says. Rosé wine is the fastest growing wine category by far here in the United States and Rosé is now transcending the idea of wine by entering other products as a color, aroma, or taste. You can munch on a Rosé chocolate bar, chew on Rosé gummy bears, lick your lips with Rosé lip balm, anoint yourself (or someone else) with Rosé body polish, and … well, Rosé your way through the day and night, too.
The New Pumpkin Spice?
Rosé is the new pumpkin spice. Or maybe it just looks that way from here. Peter Mayle was on the money when it came to Rosé. And while he might or might not be right in thinking that Rosé is a simple beverage choice for over-whelmed consumers, I think it is wrong to think that Rosé is itself quite a simple thing.
Or at least that’s what I think I learned from attending a professional seminar on Rosé wines at the Unified Wine & Grape Symposium in Sacramento (which was followed two weeks later by another seminar at the Washington Winegrowers Convention that I was forced to miss when a snowstorm caused my flight to be cancelled).
Rosé is hot, so wine business people want to learn more about growing, making, and selling it. Sue and I got a heavy dose of Rosé last year when we visited Languedoc and the Loire Valley and met Elizabeth Gabay whose book, Rosé: understanding the pink revolution, is the best resource we have found for understanding everything pink. Herewith some observations as I try to deconstruct the Rosé phenomenon.
A Paler Shade of Pink?
I cannot think of any other type of wine where color seems to matter as much as for Rosé. This is a fact that was stressed in all the presentations we attended. Although the first Rosé wines I can remember tasting here in the U.S. were dark pink in the Tavel style, the fashion today, according to conventional wisdom, is that paler is better — to the point where one wine we sampled could have passed for a white wine!
I don’t know if it is true, but the word on the street is that consumers think pale is dry and darker is sweeter. Pale and dry is associated with Peter Mayle’s Provence and those wines seem to fly off the shelf.
It is not the case that all French wines fit this profile — Tavel remains a noteworthy outlier, for example. And Rosé from Languedoc and from the Loire Valley come in a range of hues, as Sue’s photo from a Loire tasting makes clear. Rosé wines made here in the U.S. range from dark to light and I was once served a deep dark “Rosé” that was not a Rosé at all in my view — I think it was an attempt at saingée Syrah gone badly wrong.
One Hue to Rule Them All?
Does one (pale) hue really rule them all? I was interested in the presentation by Jason Haas of Tablas Creek at the Unified Symposium that provided some insights into consumer attitudes. Tablas Creek Vineyard makes two Rosé wines, which makes sense given its association with the Perrin family, which make a lot of Rosé wine in France. Together they account for about 20% of total production. One is a pale pink dry wine made as a Rosé using purchased grapes from the local area. It’s a big hit in the by-the-glass on-trade market.
The other wine, made in much smaller quantities, comes from estate grapes and is made using the saingée method, which means that some of the juice is drained off while still pink leaving a more concentrated red wine behind. You might say that the Rosé is a by-product of red wine making, but I prefer to think that the pink and red are co-produced. This wine has more structure and character and demands food. Sue and I thought it was the best wine of the tasting.
The darker wine, which might be a tough sell if it went into distribution because of its color and higher price, is reserved for tasting room and wine club purchases. It sells out every year in part, I suppose, because tasting room buyers can sample the wine and not just look at the color. And also, frankly, because it is different and a bit special and that’s something people look for. Haas thinks having two pink wines, each crafted for its own market, works pretty well.
Hitting a Moving (Color) Target
So pink isn’t as simple as you might think when it is time to sell the wines and it isn’t simple either when they are made. One speaker said that his Rosé was the hardest wine in his portfolio to make. I am not enough of an enologist to appreciate all the technical details that were presented (there were plenty of experts in the room all nodding their heads), but it was easy to understand how color makes things more difficult.
You might think that pink is pink and once you have the color you want, that’s that. But apparently you would be wrong. The color you achieve in the tank, we were told, is just the beginning and as time passes, and especially as SO2 is added at bottling, the wine gets paler and paler. So you need to begin darker than you want and then control the process pretty closely in order to coast into the shade of pale you are aiming for.
This is something that Elizabeth Gabay finds disturbing because it means, at some point, winemakers may sacrifice what’s necessary to make the best wine in order to get the right color of pink. Rosé wines in general might be better, she suggests, and more popular and drinkable, if color wasn’t such a central concern.
Simplicity is Complicated
The complexity increases when other issues such as grape varieties and viticultural practices are considered. Here in the U.S the Rosé wines are made from easily recognizable grape varieties. Barnard Griffin, a Washington State producer, makes a Rosé of Sangiovese that wins gold (and double gold) medals in competitions and flies off the supermarket shelves. Sangiovese is easy to understand and to like even if it isn’t part of the standard Provence recipe. But in the Loire we discovered wines made from unfamiliar grapes that are in fact only grown for Rosé! Who knew?
I guess Rosé is like any other type of wine. It can be as simple (or complex) as you want it to be. Will consumers revolt if and when they discover Rosé’s hidden geeky side? Yes, if Peter Mayle is right and they are fleeing what they see are unnecessary complication. But I’m not really sure that’s true.

Barren desert 'fairy circles' caused by … rain?
Business - February 26, 2019, 12:21:42 PM EST

ACEP18 Tuesday Product and Service Showcases Keep You Up To Speed

Print-Friendly Version
ACEP is proud to bring you the newly revamped Product Showcase in the Exhibit Hall. These educational and product-oriented sessions provide you with an in-depth presentation on a product or service you may have seen on the exhibit floor. Show up early! Seating is limited to 150 and a boxed meal will be served at each event.
GRIFOLS
Tuesday, 11:30 a.m.–12:15 p.m. 
Ballroom 20A, San Diego Conference Center
The Rabies Threat in the U.S. and the Role of Postexposure Prophylaxis
Speaker: Charles Rupprecht, VMD, MS, PhD
This educational program will cover the prevalence of rabies in the United States, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and the most up-to-date treatment guidelines and best practices.
JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICALS
Tuesday, 11:30 a.m.–12:15 p.m. 
Product Showcase 1, Near Booth #2605, Exhibit Hall, San Diego Conference Center
An Evidence-Based Approach to Treatment of DVT/PE and Reducing the Risk of Recurrence
Speaker: Greg Fermann, MD
This lecture will discuss treatment options for patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and how they may reduce the risk of recurrent thrombotic events.
THERMO FISHER
Tuesday, 11:30 a.m.–12:15 p.m. 
Product Showcase 2, Near Booth #2840, Exhibit Hall, San Diego Conference Center
Evaluation of Patients with Suspected LRTI and/or Sepsis: The Utilization of Procalcitonin and Other Biomarkers in the Emergency Department
Speaker: Sean-Xavier Neath, MD, PhD
The care of the severely ill patient with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) requires the simultaneous integration of numerous assessment and treatment modalities by the emergency physician. Assessment of bacterial burden has not historically had diagnostic tests that delivered actionable results to first-line providers. In this talk, advances in diagnostic technology that benefit the emergency department will be explored. Procalcitonin is one tool that provides valuable information that complements and enhances the picture provided by previously existing tests.
GENENTECH
Tuesday, 2:30–3:15 p.m. 
Product Showcase 1, Near Booth #2605, Exhibit Hall, San Diego Conference Center
Assessing Disability in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Beyond Just the NIHSS
Speaker: Alkesh Brahmbhatt, DO
Join us to learn from fellow colleague and ACEP member Dr. Brahmbhatt about assessing disability in acute ischemic stroke beyond just the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).
Discern what is and is not assessed by the NIHSS.
Understand why low NIHSS scores do not always equate to an absence of disability.
Recognize how acute deficits can relate to long-term disability.
Identify deficits that the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association consider disabling.
Stroke affects 795,000 people per year in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of serious long-term disability. Stroke can be overwhelmingly burdensome to caregivers, who are many times a family member, friend, neighbor and/or a health care professional. Join us to learn how to better individualize assessments for stroke-related disability in the acute phase to help improve patient outcomes.

Review of Configuration of Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Corridors
Institutional Document | November 2016
Facebook
Twitter
LinkedIn
Print
This paper assesses the current configuration of GMS economic corridors and proposes their extensions and realignments.
These changes will help ensure that further investments in GMS economic corridors are focused on areas with the best potential to allow these corridors to become fully functioning economic corridors, thus maximizing their contribution to increased incomes and employment in the subregion.
The primary considerations for including specific routes as part of East–West Economic Corridor (EWEC), North–South Economic Corridor (NSEC), and Southern Economic Corridor (SEC) in the current configuration were their potential to become trade, investment, tourism, and transit corridors, and the presence of significant sections that can be developed into hubs for regional trade, investment, and tourism. In reviewing their configuration, the primary concern is to ensure that
developments arising from the opening up of Myanmar are taken into account;
corridors include and link all GMS capitals and major economic centers;
corridors are connected to key GMS maritime gateways and industrial hubs; and
major trade flows are reflected in the alignment of the corridors.

Парфюмерная вода	(тестер) ?
Тестер полностью идентичен предлагаемой на продажу парфюмерии, обладает точно таким же по качеству и стойкости запахом. Отличие только в упаковке! Тестер продается в обычной картонной упаковке или без нее. Особенно актуальна покупка тестера, когда парфюмерия берется для личного пользования, а не в подарок.

Florida law enforcement officers are looking for someone who allegedly stabbed a man multiple times before being shot at in response. The armed citizen had noticed that a black pickup truck that was being driven erratically was following him. He pulled into a bank parking lot, but the truck followed. A man exited that vehicle and, armed with a knife, confronted his would-be victim. The citizen tried to hit the perpetrator or push him away and get back into his car, but after he flailed at the troublemaker, he was stabbed several times. The injured victim crawled into his vehicle and retrieved a handgun that he used to fire at the attacker. The perp jumped into his truck and, with a woman behind the steering wheel, fled. It was unclear whether the bullet struck anyone. (wokv.com, Jacksonville, Fla., 9/14/18)
The Armed Citizen Extra
An intruder learned the hard way not to bring a rock to a gunfight. After a burglar used a stone to shatter a window and force his way inside a San Diego home, the homeowner shot him, ending the incident. The would-be thief was rushed to a local hospital, where he was expected to survive his injuries. (Fox 5, San Diego, Calif., 11/30/2018)
From the Armed Citizen® Archives
December 1932
Disregarding shots aimed in their direction, T.L. Jolliff, teller, and Lewis Bress, manager, of a branch of the Virginia's National Bank in Norfolk, Va., prevented a robber's attempted holdup of the bank, though the robber escaped, on October 27.

Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who – The Snowmen
Posted by Rich Johnston December 31, 2012 Comment
Sorry about the delay, life got in the way. It happens. The following contains bits by Rich and bits by Brendon.
1. Let It Snow
We first meet Oswin/Clara in The Asylum Of The Daleks. A planet covered in snow. What memories might they have brought with them when they came to Earth? Could snow be transferring her from place to place. Is she also some kind of mirror, reflecting that around her? Was the ice governess a foreshadowing of that? There are plenty of mirrors here, Holmes and Vastra, Vastra and the Doctor, the Doctor and Holmes, The Doctor and the Intelligence, Vastra and Jenny, Jenny and Styx, Clara just has that reflection in herself…
2. Villains You Hate To Hate
Richard E Grant played one of the greatest screen villains in Hudson Hawk, a bad guy that not even the most cynical member of the audience could find themselves rooting for. He isn’t quite so loathsome here, his villainousness is centred in the weak power fantasy of a child. But still, he’s quite a tit. He played the Doctor a couple of times before, once in Steven Moffat’s Comic Relief special and then as an animated 9th Doctor. He plays the bad guy sooooo much better. Especially when he has the tragic backstory.
3. Victoriana Vs Prop 8
The lesbian human/Silurian partnership of Lady Vastra and Jenny give us yet one more twist, they’re now married. One thing to note for those screaming about the gay agenda, this was not an uncommon arrangement. Women getting married, if not common, was accepted, even though no sexual arrangement would be presumed. It was just one of those things. And even in Victorian London, people have more important things to worry about. Such as Clara’s new gentleman friend…
4. Great Intelligence, Weak Powers Of Observation
Judging from early reviews, the appearance of the Great Intelligence is something of a twist that pops up late in the episode. And maybe it is for people who can’t read English, were watching on their phone or forget their glasses – not once but twice did we see an in-focus business card bearing the GI logo and the words Great Intelligence, very clearly. Add to this the disembodied voice of Sir Ian McKellen and this is less of a big surprise than something that sifts the fans of old Who from the newbies.
Can we add though that we also did enjoy how the Intelligence seems obsessed with controlling snowmen, abominable or otherwise?
5. Iced Over
If I were The Doctor and the one word I heard was Pond, I’d probably get even more depressed. Maybe he saw it as a sign – it wasn’t. It has no more to do with Amy and Rory than The Rose and Crown has to do with Clara being crowned the new Rose. Ahem.
But he does seem to give his key away quicker than usual. Such a slut, that Doctor, opening his TARDIS doors for anyone who flutters their eyes, points out a pair of gauntlets and is handy with an umbrella.
6. A Great Defective
Not one but two gags about Sherlock Holmes, Steven Moffat’s “other” show. First of all, the proposal that Lady Vastra was Arthur Conan Doyle’s inspiration from his creation. Well, he certainly enjoyed a whole vat load of liberties if that’s the case.
And then Matt Smith in the Deerstalker, a bit of “Wholmes” fan service. It was funny and silly but I don’t quite know why the Doctor took this tack, and seeing how unnecessary it apparently was, why he didn’t just turn up as himself. Still, he knew that the Intelligence’s servant had a penchant for Doyle’s work, maybe it just got him through the door. And does he know that the French word for a type of fish is Colin? Not a goldfish, but close…
Will we see like for like? Cumberbatch investigating an anachronistic Police Call Box that suddenly appeared on Baker Street?
7. Eighties On The Inside
A new looking TARDIS on the inside and it’s a crash back to the eighties, if it had had a decent budget. Plastic instead of copper (and a lot less reflective surfaces for the production crew to deal with) and everything moving, this is the Pater Davison TARDIS that should have been, and Matt Smith’s face in the titles. Bring on Nyssa.
Also the Doctor going into retirement and yet being dragged back was originally a Douglas Adams that was turned down back then. Looks like Moffat managed to keep it with him.
8. Don’t Forget The Worm
There’s a bit of set-up about a memory wiping worm at the start. It’s particularly fun because the structure of the episode works best if you kinda-sorta forget that it featured and “Aha!” when it pops back up. Which means you’ll enjoy this episode more if you have a sort of mini-worm in your top pocket. Which most people do. It’s just Brendon that doesn’t.
9. A Fairytale Of Old London Town.
Part Mary Poppins, part Cloud Man, we are back to the Doctor being a Fairytale again. Literally with Clara here, and a man in the clouds living among us, with new worlds to show us and a set of rules to play by and puzzles to solve in order to meet him. Last series, the fairytale became a legend and then became a fact. Thanks to Clara and his faked death, he’s managed to put some of that frog back in the box and has become a story for children again. And that’s true about the show as well. Even though we also get…
10. Oh My God They Killed Clara
She’s got a really nasty case of whatever Rory had. If she’s even a she, singular, and not actually several shes. Is this a woman? An echo of a woman? A haunting of some kind? Clones? Moffat has promised that there is a solution, but it will be a long time coming.
Anybody watching the show “cold” might have been surprised by Clara’s demise, providing they were invested enough in her. Most of those who knew she was the “new companion” likely knew enough to know this wouldn’t be the end thanks to all of the set pictures and cast and crew interviews. And that corset is seriously strong enough to keep her body from being a pile of bloody mush in the snow when it lands. Must be the alien snow.
Things to watch for are clocks… Clara was born in Big Ben clock tower apparently, she dies with the clocks chiming midnight, it’s about time. But then again it always is.
And no one seems to obsess too much about Styx’s impossible return in comparison. Never mind, take it away for some Songtaran Carols…

Dallas Sportscaster: Arizona Hired Kliff Kingsbury Because He’s ‘Young and White’

DANIEL LEBERFELD
11 Jan 2019
Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen believes NFL owners are guilty of “covert racism” in their hiring practices, and that Arizona hired Kliff Kingsbury because he’s “young and white.”
The NFL started the 2018 season with seven black head coaches, and now it’s down to two.
The five black coaches who were fired are Steve Wilks (Arizona Cardinals), Hue Jackson (Cleveland Browns), Todd Bowles (New York Jets), Vance Joseph (Denver Broncos) and Marvin Lewis (Cincinnati Bengals). The two left are Anthony Lynn (Los Angeles Chargers) and Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers).
“The covert racism of the NFL ownership group is so bad, the NFL had to make a rule so minority coaches could at least get an interview,” Hansen said on Wednesday during his sportscast on ABC’s Dallas affiliate WFAA.
.@dalehansen goes Unplugged: "Kingsbury fits all the criteria to be a head coach in the NFL: He's an offensive genius, he's young — and he's white, and not necessarily in that order." https://t.co/Cv8HleHac5 pic.twitter.com/J4ixZIURM9
— WFAA (@wfaa) January 10, 2019
Hansen is referring to “The Rooney Rule” which the NFL instituted in 2003 mandating teams interview ethnic-minority candidates for head coaching and GM jobs.
The Cardinals fired Wilks after just one losing season, and replaced him with Kliff Kingsbury, who had a losing record at Texas Tech (35-40). This irks some, but Hansen believes he understands the reason Kingsbury got the Cardinals’ job.
“There has been a lot of criticism of the Arizona Cardinals hiring Kliff Kingsbury as their head coach,” Hansen said. “Kingsbury fits all the criteria to be a head coach in the NFL. He’s an offensive genius and he’s young and he’s white and not necessarily in that order.”
Hansen, a Navy veteran, originally from Iowa, thinks African-American coach Kris Richard deserves the Miami Dolphins head coaching job.
“Cowboys secondary coach Kris Richard has been interviewed and there are reports he might get the Miami job,” Hansen said. “After what he’s done with this Cowboys’ defense, how could he not? At least if it is true what black parents have been telling their children for decades now, you have to be twice as good, to go half as far. I dream of that day those parents are wrong. Because now, their not.”
Hansen feels he’s been a recipient of “white privilege” throughout his long career in radio and television, and feels this might be a problem in the NFL as well.
“A lot of people don’t understand how Kingsbury can have a losing record, no NFL experience, and get one of the 32 NFL jobs,” Hansen said. “But getting fired at Tech doesn’t eliminate him from moving up, at least it doesn’t to me. I have had 11 jobs in my life, been fired from eight of them, and moved up every time. And I’m American enough to tell you, I think Channel 8 was right to give me another chance, but I am the product of white privilege in America. I never denied that I wasn’t either. If they made a poster, my picture should be on it. Getting fired at one place and getting another chance isn’t the problem, but young talented coaches of color not getting the chance that is a huge problem.”

Madonna Brushes off Mexico Violence for Gym Opening
By Susana Seijas
December 1, 2010 / 8:59 AM / CBS News

MEXICO CITY (CBS) Shrugging off threat of general Mexico violence, Madonna flew into Mexico City Monday and embraced a throng of fans and fitness fanatics at the opening of her new Hard Candy Fitness gym.
PICTURES: Madonna
"No Sweat, No Candy," read one of the slogans in the luxurious three-story, 32,000-square-foot gym, which also featured a whole wall of Andy Warhol-style pictures of the singer, in the uspcale Lomas Altas neighborhood of Mexico City.
The singer was greeted by Marcelo Ebrard, mayor of Mexico City, with his actress wife, Mariagna Pratts, and other Mexico City luminaries and investors.
Minutes before meeting Madonna, I was standing behind the mayor, who was busy updating his Twitter account via his BlackBerry. "On behalf of us all, I thank Madonna for her presence and for having chosen us as the first city with one of her gyms," the m
ayor tweeted.
Despite the country's raging drug war, the 52-year-old mother of four said she picked Mexico City because of her love for the country.
"I've come to Mexico for years to do research, I love Mexican culture, architecture, food, music and art," she said to Mexican newspaper Milenio.
Security was intense surrounding the opening. Police helicopters hovered above the gym and a whole street was cordoned off an hour before Madonna made her appearance.
"A lot of places I go to are considered dangerous whether that's Tel Aviv or Rio, that never stops me from going somewhere to put on a show. I'm not hindered by that. I have good security and I'm not worried about it," Madonna said as she walked down the red carpet.
Madonna's Hardy Candy group said it expects to open more fitness centers in Argentina, Brazil and Russia in coming months.

Membership to the gym runs between 1,200 to 2,000 pesos, or $95 to $160 per month, quite a hefty price tag for many Mexicans, but the norm for lavish gyms in Mexico City.
A crowd of nearly 700 new members awaited the singer inside. New eliptical training machines jostled for space amid the impromptu Grey Goose vodka stands. At the start of the night, most members were drinking Gatorade.
Oscar Salazar, one of the gym trainers who was handpicked by Madonna to dance along in a specially choreographed dance class by her following the opening of the gym, said he wished Madonna would influence more Mexicans to get fit.
"We have a growing obesity problem in Mexico," Salazar said as he showed new members around the gym. "You should've seen some of the police officers who came to check out the location before Madonna arrived - they could hardly fit into their uniforms!"
Amid the well-groomed and hyper rich sophisticated Mexico set, I found Benjamin Cardozo, a 29 year old singer and dancer who told me, "I've joined the gym just so I could attend this party, I can't really afford it, but I had to see Madonna in the flesh."

R. Kelly due in court after turning himself in to police
Updated on: February 23, 2019 / 12:02 PM / CBS News
R. Kelly turns himself in
Chicago — R. Kelly turned himself in to Chicago police late Friday, hours after Illinois prosecutors announced he had been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Kelly is accused of abusing four victims, at least three of whom were allegedly underage, in incidents that date back to 1998, according the indictment. The most recent alleged abuse was in 2010.
Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweet Friday night that Kelly would be fingerprinted, photographed and processed. He will remain in police custody and appear in court on Saturday, Guglielmi said. He will be in court for a bond hearing, CBS Chicago reported.
Kelly's attorney Steve Greenberg said Friday evening the R&B star is "shell-shocked" and "extraordinarily disappointed and depressed" by the sex abuse charges. Greenberg said he offered to sit down with prosecutors to discuss "why these charges are baseless," but they refused, the Associated Press reported. He said Kelly maintains his innocence and looks forward to being acquitted at trial.

According to court records, Kelly's first court date has been scheduled for March 8. If he is convicted on all 10 counts, a judge could decide that the sentences run one after the other, making it possible that he receives a sentence of up to 70 years behind bars, the Associated Press reported. Probation is another option under the statute, said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.
Kelly has for decades faced allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, but had denied them. Greenberg has maintained the singer's innocence and said that he never knowingly had sex with underage girls.
"I have a client who hasn't committed any crime, so I don't have a lot of work to do as a criminal defense lawyer," Greenberg told CBS News last week.
Last month, Foxx asked for possible alleged victims of sexual assault or domestic violence by Kelly to come forward after the "deeply, deeply disturbing" allegations outlined in the Lifetime docu-series "Surviving R. Kelly."
"In order to have an investigation ... we have to have victims and witnesses who are willing to come forth with whatever information that they have," Foxx said.
The docu-series, which aired on Lifetime, features 50 interviews, including accuser Jerhonda Pace; the parents of one of Kelly's alleged victims; Kelly's ex-wife, Andrea Kelly; ex-girlfriend Kitti Jones and brothers Carey and Bruce Kelly.
Foxx said she saw some of the docu-series.
R. Kelly faces charges amid sex abuse allegations
"I was sickened," she said. "I was sickened by the allegations. I was sickened as a survivor. I was sickened as a mother. I'm sickened as a prosecutor."
After the charges were announced, "Surviving R. Kelly" producer dream hampton on Twitter said: "The survivors are heroes."
The state's attorney's office identified the victims only by initials. The first, H.W., was involved in incidents between May 26, 1998 and May 25, 1999, according to the state's attorney's office. The grand jury returned an indictment of four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse related to H.W., who was under 17.
The second, R.L., was involved in an incident between Sept. 26, 1998 and Sept. 25, 2001. The grand jury returned an indictment of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse related to R.L., who was also under 17, according to the state's attorney's office. The indictment does not list an age for the third victim, L.C., who was involved in an incident on Feb. 18, 2003.
The grand jury returned an indictment of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse related to that incident, which the indictment said happened during the course of an attempted criminal sexual assault. The fourth victim, J.P., was involved in incidents between May 1, 2009 and Jan. 31, 2010. The grand jury returned an indictment of three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse related to J.P., who was under 17, according to the state's attorney's office.
Last week, a law enforcement source told CBS News that prosecutors in Chicago have obtained a nearly 45-minute video that purportedly shows Kelly engaging in sex acts a 14-year-old girl.
Attorney Michael Avenatti says VHS tape shows R. Kelly with underage girl
Lawyer Michael Avenatti turned the video over to the Cook County state's attorney and told CBS News he got the tape from someone who knows both Kelly and the alleged victim "extremely well." He described it as a "bombshell of epic proportions." CBS News has not viewed any of the footage, but Avenatti said he and Illinois prosecutors are certain Kelly is the man on the tape.
"After 25 years of serial sexual abuse and assault of underage girls, the day of reckoning for R. Kelly has arrived," Avenatti tweeted Friday.
Avenatti, who was approached by an individual seeking representation in April, said he received the tape earlier this month. He claims R. Kelly's voice can be heard on the recording and that a telltale mole on his back is clearly visible.
CBS News has confirmed the video was recently turned over to the Cook County state's attorney in Chicago, where Kelly lives.
Speaking at a press conference after the charges were announced Friday, Avenatti said that the girl in the video he turned over to Foxx's office is one of the victims listed in the indictment. He said he represents at least one of the four victims, but wouldn't say whether the victim he represents is the girl he says is seen in the video.
Avenatti says he represents six clients, including two victims, two parents and two people he called whistleblowers who he said could be described as "knowing R. Kelly and being within his inner circle for the better part of 25 years."
Avenatti said the video he turned over to Foxx's office shows two separate scenes from two different days at Kelly's home sometime around 1999. He said it shows Kelly having sex with the girl and urinating on her. He said it also shows Kelly and the girl watching another video on a television, also apparently of Kelly having sex with a young girl. He says both Kelly and the victim state in excess of 10 times in the video that the girl is 14 years old.
"This tape leaves no question as to whether R. Kelly is guilty of multiple sexual illegal acts against a 14-year-old girl," Kelly said.
He said he has another video and is in the process of obtaining a third, but wouldn't detail what was in the two videos.
Avenatti also said he has evidence that Kelly and others close to him engaged in obstruction of justice to "rig" the outcome of Kelly's 2008 trial. Kelly was acquitted on child pornography charges in 2008 after disputing he was the man seen in a grainy video having sex with an underage girl. Avenatti said the tape in that case is different from the one he provided. He did not say whether the new tape showed a different alleged victim.
Avenatti said Kelly had over 10 "enablers" over the years he said "turned a blind eye" to the alleged abuse, and Avenatti vowed to investigate them.
He praised Foxx and her office for their professionalism and said he expects Kelly to be convicted.
"He should never walk free another day in his life as a result of the over two decades of abuse he dished out and participated in time and time again," Avenatti said.
R. Kelly accuser says R&B singer threatened her and her family
On Thursday, two new Kelly accusers spoke out publicly with their lawyer, Gloria Allred. The women, Latresa Scaff and Rochelle Washington, said Kelly picked them out of a crowd at a Baltimore party in the 1990s when both were underage, asked them back to his hotel and exposed himself. Scaff said she engaged in sexual activity with Kelly, but said she was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol and didn't have the capacity to consent.
Allred said the two women planned to meet with the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, the AP reports. She reportedly didn't say why she had chosen that jurisdiction for alleged crimes in Maryland.
"The days of running and hiding his victimization of women from the criminal justice system have now come to an end for R. Kelly," Allred said in a statement.

"Tonight I'll be attending the Golden Globe Awards with Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep to shine the spotlight on domestic workers and people who are particularly vulnerable to abuse and often excluded from protections or recourse," she wrote.

Advocates call for Medicaid expansion

CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE
ASHEVILLE – Health care advocates released a report Thursday detailing the effect of North Carolina's health care coverage gap on children, and held six demonstrations in cities across the state, including in Asheville, calling on the governor to expand Medicaid.
According to the report by Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families, more than one-quarter of North Carolinians eligible for expanded Medicaid enrollment under the Affordable Care Act are parents. There are 144,000 uninsured children in North Carolina, the report said.
Health care advocates and local residents urged Gov. Pat McCrory to close the Medicaid gap in a demonstration on Thursday outside the Minnie Jones Health Center.
Local Medicaid activist and founder of WNC Health Advocates Leslie Boyd said her son died because he could not get health insurance and since then she has been advocating for the cause.
"I just want the governor and state legislators to understand that when we say we want the coverage gap closed, that we mean save these lives," she said.
Studies show the Medicaid gap results in more than 1,000 deaths each year and costs the state 43,000 jobs. An estimated 357,000 state residents fall into this gap and 500,000 are excluded from Medicaid coverage, according to the report by Georgetown University.
Republicans in the General Assembly are adamant that any expansion of the state's Medicaid rolls must come after an overhaul of the system. After a Supreme Court decision upholding a portion of the 2010 health care law came in June, McCrory said he was in negotiations with leaders in Washington to obtain waivers to use federal funding for a state-specific plan to expand Medicaid.
About 30 protesters in front of the old Capitol building — where the governor's offices are located — demanded on Thursday that McCrory release his plan, while highlighting their concerns based on the Georgetown report's findings.
Peggy Weil, the main organizer of the Asheville event, said she was looking forward to reinvigorating people in the community to ask the governor to close the gap.
"There have been too many delays and deaths of those chronically ill who need health care," she said. "We need to address this now."
Organizers sought to rally people to call McCrory's office, pressing him to come up with a plan to present to legislators.
Seven speakers shared their stories at Thursday's rally.
One speaker, Jaclyn Kiger, a managing attorney at Pisgah Legal Services, was looking forward to the opportunity to raise awareness.
"It is a way to provide education about the issue and lead to more access to health care coverage across the state," Kiger said.
Dr. Shannon Dowler also spoke. The director of Blue Ridge Community Health Services in Henderson County, she has spent her career working with marginalized groups and the underserved.
"It's my passion in medicine to care for those who may not have access to health care," she said before the demonstration. "Now is the right time to make the change and get more people access."
Closing the gap is a matter of life and death, Weil said.
"This is about people with heart disease, diabetes and HIV who all need access to care so they can be healthy and maintain their health," she said. Weil is the WNC AIDS Project advocacy coordinator.
"When parents are covered and getting their physical and mental health needs met, they are better caretakers and their children are more likely to get insured," said Greg Borom, director of advocacy for Children First/Communities in Schools.
Advocates who participated in rallies across the state were part of "Where's the Plan?" Day of Action organized by local groups and a statewide coalition of Medicaid expansion advocates.
If Medicaid is not expanded, an estimated 8,400 Buncombe County, 3,400 Henderson County and 1,400 McDowell County workers will not have health coverage in 2016, according to www.ncmedicaidexpansion.com.
However, with an expansion of Medicaid coverage, North Carolina could gain $21 billion in federal tax revenue, create 43,000 jobs, and generate $161 million in new county tax revenue between 2016-20, according to a 2014 study in Health Affairs.
"Standing here today we are optimistic," Dowler said in conclusion to her speech.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Property Tax	
The City of Berea's property taxes are levied and collected by Cuyahoga County.
Property tax in Berea is based on the County assigned value of all parcels of land within each taxing district. The assignment of value is administered by the Cuyahoga County Auditor's office. The County Auditor determines an assessed value which is 35% of the appraised market value for each parcel.
Value Updates
This value is updated every three years based on the average price that surrounding or similar properties sold for within the previous three-year period. Every six years, the Auditor revisits all properties to re-appraise the value of each piece of land based on any building additions or major improvements.
More Information
For real property information, contact the Cuyahoga County Auditor's office at 216-443-7010, or visit the Fiscal Officer's Webpage.
To view the City of Berea’s tax rates please visit the Cuyahoga County Treasurer Page.

How social media has changed the landscape for editorial cartooning

(L to R) Cartoons by Grant E. Hamilton
“You filthy kunt…a baseball bat to your head is now due.”
“HOW FUCKING DARE YOU CUNT. GET THE HELL OUT OF THE BUSINESS…”
“Bitch, your days are numbered.”
“do the world a favor, go hang yourself”
“I hope you get raped to death”
I stood frozen in front of my computer, watching my Twitter feed roll like a slot machine reel. My editorial cartoon criticizing then-presidential candidate Ted Cruz for his decision to have his 7-year-old daughter read from the script of a political attack ad had just been published online by The Washington Post, and four days of continuous emails, tweets, and comments had begun.

Since my cartoon ran in December, I’ve thought a great deal about the role of social media in stoking the resulting outrage. Although passionate criticism over a provocative cartoon isn’t new, the introduction of social media into politics and election campaigning has dramatically increased the speed and intensity of those reactions, and the repercussions for the editorial cartooning profession. This has been especially true during the volatile 2016 presidential campaign.
Ann Telnaes targeted this Ted Cruz ad.
Editorial cartoonists are a thick-skinned group; we’re used to getting negative feedback from irate readers telling us we’re idiots and how terrible our cartoons are. Many of my colleagues have received death threats as well—but this was different. In my almost 25 years as an editorial cartoonist, I have never received the level or amount of misogynistic vitriol I did over that cartoon. In addition to comments like the ones above, I was Twitter trolled, my archived cartoons doctored, and my photograph tweeted with the caption: “Makes fun of Ted Cruz’s children, aborted all of her own.”
Visual metaphors are an important component of editorial cartooning. They are the language we use to convey our point of view. The visual metaphor in this cartoon was an organ grinder, an early 20th century street musician who used leashed animals, usually monkeys, to collect coins from appreciative audiences. Because the point of my cartoon was to criticize Cruz’s decision to exploit his children for political gain, I drew him as a campaigning organ grinder with performing monkeys. This important part of the cartoon was lost immediately in the social media outrage fueled by tweets and comments from the senator and his supporters that mischaracterized the cartoon as attacking his daughters. The Washington Post pulled the cartoon within hours and replaced it with a note from Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt, saying, “It’s generally been the policy of our editorial section to leave children out of it.” That was when the Cruz campaign reprinted the cartoon in an email asking for political donations to fight the “vicious personal attack on my daughters.”
The cartoon Ann Telnaes created in response to Ted Cruz’s ad.
My colleague Joel Pett of the Lexington Herald-Leader had a similar experience last year with a cartoon criticizing Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin for his opposition to the resettlement of Syrian refugees—Bevin had claimed there was a possibility of terrorists entering the state. He called the cartoon racist because it mentioned his adopted children from Ethiopia, and he issued a statement condemning the newspaper for its racial intolerance and for attacking his kids. An online right-wing group picked up the story and continued the misrepresentation of the cartoon’s intent. For 36 hours, Pett and the Herald-Leader received phone calls, emails, and social media messages demanding apologies. Pett and his editor responded that the cartoon was not racist.
Pett’s experience, and mine, underscore how social media has changed the landscape for editorial cartooning—how it is being used as a tool of intimidation by interest groups and campaigns to try to silence criticism. Through social media they can quickly mobilize their supporters and distribute misinformation, allowing mob mentalities to spread as soon as a cartoon is posted online. The medium is lightning fast and provides the protection of anonymity. Add a news media that seems to value clickbait over presenting context about the editorial cartooning craft and often parrots the inaccurate characterizations the campaigns’ supporters spread, and you might as well paint a red bull’s eye on the cartoonist’s back.
During my four-day marathon of emails and tweets, I was trolled by a well known conservative cable news commentator who characterized my cartoon as attacking children and tried to bait me with insulting tweets. A member of the Cruz campaign communications team also trolled me, crowing that their “folks pushed back hard,” and “we won” after the cartoon was pulled. (Ironically, months later that same person was trolled herself with sexist tweets from Trump supporters.)
In the glut of coverage, most news outlets didn’t bother mentioning or showing the part of the video where Cruz had his daughter read from his political attack ad’s script. Except for a couple of print articles, including an informative piece by the New York Daily News that offered much-needed historical perspective about editorial cartooning, there was practically no coverage that explained what an editorial cartoon is supposed to do or the importance and use of visual metaphors. Instead there was outrage and talk about monkeys and children. Many of my cartooning colleagues pushed back with thoughtfully-written (and cartooned) arguments about the purpose of an editorial cartoon; had they not done so, I would have faced the equivalent of being tarred and feathered, with cable news talking heads leading the way with torches.
If we’re being harassed and pressured not to aim our pens critically, we won’t be able to call ourselves editorial cartoonists much longer–we won’t be able to create anything but mushy, uncontroversial drawings.
Let me be clear: Even in the face of this kind of attack, I am not advocating limiting people’s right to speak, however obnoxious and offensive the language is (threats are not included in this; threaten bodily harm, and that’s where your free speech ends). I would much rather have an abundance of stupid, ignorant speech (as this political season is giving us) than watch a slow slide into self-censorship and possibly worse for my profession, with cartoon police deciding what can or cannot be drawn. I have spoken out publicly in support of cartoonists to freely express themselves without fear of imprisonment or threats, including the Danish cartoonists in 2006 and the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists in 2015, both of whom published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad.
The big worry for editorial cartoonists these past several years has been the widespread loss of staff jobs as newspapers fold or choose to eliminate their cartoonist in favor of buying syndicated cartoons. Finding paying work online remains problematic for cartoonists. But the much bigger danger now is the use of social media to intimidate and silence, because it attacks the satirical core of what makes a cartoon an editorial cartoon. If we’re being harassed and pressured not to aim our pens critically, we won’t be able to call ourselves editorial cartoonists much longer–we won’t be able to create anything but mushy, uncontroversial drawings.
How should the journalism community protect cartoonists so they can do their jobs? We need to educate and be ready the next time a cartoonist aims his or her satire against a thin-skinned politician or interest group looking for an opportunity to manipulate fair criticism. Be aware when a false narrative is being presented to deflect the actual intent of a cartoon; talk to your editors and come up with a plan to counter the misinformation. Instead of just hopping on the social media outrage bandwagon gathering clicks, media outlets need to do their homework, explaining the role in holding powerful people accountable that editorial cartoonists have had for centuries in America. Educate yourself about the components of an editorial cartoon, and how satire, irony, caricature, symbols, and visual metaphors all contribute to its makeup.
The US Supreme Court affirmed the essential role of editorial cartoons in a democracy when it ruled in the 1988 Hustler v Falwell case that satire is speech protected under the First Amendment. “Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate,” conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in the majority opinion. “From the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without them.”
We might be wearing the metaphorical funny hat, but we take our jobs as journalists very seriously. It has been said cartoonists are on the front lines of the war to defend free speech. Don’t make the job easier for the social media lynch mobs by ignoring the threat their attacks pose to that freedom.
Has America ever needed a media watchdog more than now? Help us by joining CJR today.
Ann Telnaes creates editorial cartoons in various media—animation, visual essays, live sketches, and traditional print—for The Washington Post. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for her print cartoons in the Los Angeles Times. Her print work was shown in a solo exhibit at the Library of Congress in 2004. That same year, her first book, Humor’s Edge, was published by Pomegranate Press and the Library of Congress. A collection of Vice President Dick Cheney cartoons, Dick, was self-published by Telnaes and Sara Thaves in 2006. She is the incoming president for the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists (AAEC).

Why can pro athletes sue for more than an average Joe?
A warning: This post isn’t about what is fair in a cosmic justice sense. Instead it’s about the reality of the legal system and the logic behind it. Our firm doesn’t make the rules, it just plays by them.
Lawsuits are not a fun pay day for people who have suffered at the hands of others, or a chance for people to become rich by seizing the assets of someone else. Instead, litigation is about making someone “whole” again after someone else’s actions have harmed them.
Imagine this, two people are waiting in line at an outdoor coffee business. A third party loses control of his car and strikes them both. Both people in line are severely injured and now have to use wheelchairs the rest of their lives. Both file lawsuits against the driver.
Let’s imagine the two victims are the same age and suffer identical injuries that prevent them from working. Both have spouses and two kids. The only difference is one of them earns $50,000 a year and the other is a professional basketball player and earns several million annually.
In normal circumstances, the basketball player will receive much higher compensation. It’s not because they are more deserving or renowned. It’s not because society values them more. It’s because both victims are being compensated on wages they will never earn because of the injury.
The lifetime earning potential of the pro athlete is much higher than that of the average person, and personal injury lawsuits factor in the lost wages that person will miss out on. As a result, the pro athlete is likely to receive a higher settlement.
That’s the legal system as we have it, and that’s the reality we have to navigate when we litigate. While money can never truly make a person whole again, it can help them make their mortgage payments and provide for their family.

No matter how outrageous a defendant’s conduct may be, there’s one thing you can never sue for:
Picture this: A person is walking down the sidewalk, enjoying a warm Spring day, when out of nowhere a drunk driver hops the curb and strikes them over from behind. The pedestrian flies through the air, lands on his feet and finds himself to be completely unharmed. A miracle occurred, as most people would have been permanently injured or killed.
On what grounds can that pedestrian, unharmed only by a stroke of luck, sue that driver, who clearly acted negligently and was at fault for what happened.
The answer is, none. There is no chance of a lawsuit here. The pedestrian does not have a case.
Why? Because you can’t sue for what could have happened, only what did happen. In this case, no one was injured.
Lawsuits aren’t some kind of bad luck lottery ticket, where people profit off of their own misfortune. No, personal injury lawsuits are about compensating people for their suffering and to help them adjust to life-changing events.
The three elements of a lawsuit
A lawsuit requires liability, causation, and damages. In this example, the driver was liable for what happened as he got behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated, which is a clear case of negligent behavior. He is also the one who caused the pedestrian to be struck, it wasn’t a faulty steering wheel or other mechanical problem. Both of those elements are required for a case, but so is damages. In this example, there were no damages as no one was injured.
Sometimes people say things like “I could have been killed.” They rightly find themselves shocked by how terribly things could have gone because of someone else’s bad behavior. Those issues shouldn’t be ignored. There may be some kind of legal consequence that will fall on the person who caused that problem. However, a lawsuit is not the solution for things that could have happened but didn’t.

Will an expert say whatever we want on the witness stand?
There are a lot of cynics out there that think expert witnesses are often shady character who will lend their credibility to any lawyer if there’s a buck in it for them. Picture someone like Dr. Nick Riveria on The Simpsons who blatantly lies and exaggerates whenever he testifies.
While that may make great television, it’s not reality. In the real world, judges and juries care about the credentials of expert witnesses – they have to be actual experts, and real experts care about their professional reputations.
What happens on a witness stand is part of the public record and typically goes on the expert’s Curriculum Vitae, or CV.
Our firm has been working with expert witnesses for decades and a lot of that cooperation is only possible because of the relationships we’ve established with well-qualified experts. They have day jobs as professors, engineers, doctors, etc. Their careers would suffer if the testimony they provided was flawed.
When we hire an expert witness there is usually a substantial cost, but we’re not paying for them to compromise their integrity. We need their integrity to be rock-solid for this case and any future cases we may bring them into. We don’t want malleable experts, we want skilled ones with excellent reputations because they help us win cases. And if we’re reaching out to hire an expert, we believe in our case and know that they will agree that our client has a viable matter.

If you don’t have these three things, you don’t have a case
Personal injury litigation is a complex subject and we never expect clients to come in knowing what all of their rights are. We’re always ready to listen to someone about their experience and let them know if they have a case or not.
Every case needs to have the following chain of three things: Liability, causation and damages. If it misses one, a lawsuit is not possible. For an example, imagine a person became violently ill after eating food at an expensive vacation resort.
The three elements of a personal injury case
Liability is the first step. Did the the defendant, or defendants, act carelessly that allowed the accident to occur. For this example, did the resort staff serve undercooked or spoiled food? Can we prove that they did?
If we can prove liability, we move on to the next step: Causation. Did the negligent behavior from the defendant cause the accident or injury? It’s not enough that the plaintiff was staying at the resort and ate the food, can we show that it was the resort’s food that made them sick, and not something else? If not, the lawsuit won’t happen.
Once we have causality established, we then have to show that the plaintiff suffered real damages. Did the victim require expensive medical treatment, miss work, or suffer excruciating pain? Did the foodborne illness cause a permanent injury or disfigurement?
It’s not enough to say the patient was in danger, they must have had real damages to be compensated through the lawsuit. You can’t sue for what could have happened, it needs to have caused them to directly suffer harm.. Without liability, causation and damages, no personal injury case can proceed.

‘Reckless’ chase by local police at core of $2.5M case
The following was originally published in the Dec. 2, 2007 issue of Rhode Island Lawyers Weekly. It has been reprinted with permission.
On the night of Feb. 19, 2004, the driver of a gold Ford Taurus was identied by a Providence police officer as a member of a local gang. A chase ensued but was quickly terminated by the police when it became apparent that the driver was determined not to stop.
The motorist crossed into Cranston where a police officer in that community began pursuing the Taurus. The chase escalated to the point that four police cruisers were traveling behind the suspect, who was observed driving south on Route 9S at a high rate of speed and with his headlights off. At one point, he was seen making a quick U-turn and then driving the wrong way into oncoming traffic; three of the pursuing police officers reportedly did likewise.
The suspect proceeded onto Route 10, again traveling the wrong way and still trailed by several police cruisers, and drove his car headlong into a vehicle being driven by Natasha Valley, a Cranston resident and mother of three who was returning home from training to become an emergency medical technician. Last month, a settlement was reached in which Valley, 29, now a paraplegic, is to receive $2.5 million. Lawyers Weekly reporter Barbara Rabinovitz spoke last week with Milton, Mass., attorney Dino M. Colucci about how he achieved that result for his client.
Q.You say that the central question in the case was whether your client could prove that the defendants – the city of Cranston and the individual police officers involved – were reckless, not merely negligent. Given the dramatic testimony that was taken in deposition, was this a challenge for you or a slam dunk?
A. It wasn’t by any stretch a slam dunk. In fact, before we took the case, several law rms had turned her away because they didn’t believe such a suit could be successfully maintained. In honesty, we took the case on faith in the hope that we could make something good come out of such a tragic set of circumstances …. Fourteen depositions were taken; we obtained broadcasts of the police communications that night as well as their [police-chase l training policy. e suspect that they were chasing was eventually apprehended, and we went to jail to try to interview him. We were actually able to meet with him for 15 minutes in a holding cell to get whatever information he was willing to impart to us.
Q. Rhode Island has a $100,000 cap on recoveries for police negligence. Would that have applied in this case? What would have been your strategy for getting around it?
A. It was an open question as to whether or not the cap would apply once all the evidence was presented at trial. The burden would have been entirely ours to prove – that the conduct of the Cranston Police Department rose to a sufficient level of recklessness – in order to avoid the cap …. The city [of Cranston] continues to maintain that they did nothing wrong; they’re not accepting liability in any sense.
Q. You say that this may be the first case to apply the law established in the May 2005 case of Seide v. The State of Rhode Island, which permits citizens to bring actions against a police department for violations of a police-chase policy. Could you have achieved the same result without the Seide decision?
A. It was fortuitous for us that that case was decided by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island about six months after we took Natasha Valley’s case [in December 2004]. We took it in hopes that we could set a precedent given the facts in our case. is may be the first application of that decision … that the lower court’s decision to dismiss the case was incorrect.
Q. You’ve said that several law rms had declined to represent your client, in the belief that such a claim could not be successfully maintained. Why did you take the case in the end?
A. First and foremost, we felt great empathy for this woman. She was a young woman with three kids and, through no fault of her own, she found herself a paraplegic. Secondly, she’s a very inspiring woman. While most people would sit around and feel self-pity about their situation, she was so optimistic about her future and the life that she wanted for her kids that it was inspiring for us. So, we couldn’t walk away.
Q. What has this case accomplished with regard to police chases?
A. It won’t set a precedent because we mediated the case and reached a settlement, so nothing’s been adjudicated …. In my experience, every case really needs to be examined on its own merits. The police have a very difficult job, and we’re sensitive to that. Very often they find themselves in the midst of chaos, and they have to make immediate judgments on what to do. But Cranston had a [vehicle-chase] policy that was formulated years before this accident, and it was our position that this policy served as a foundation, or a guideline, so that officers can apply the logic contained in the policy when they’re out amidst the chaos. And we don’t believe that was done here.
Q. You gathered quite a bit of evidence for the mediation – an interactive audio- visual program, which synthesized an animated map of the chase route, broadcasts from the police, photos of the collision and so forth. Do you think that was instrumental in getting the defendants to settle?
A. I do. In my opinion, it synthesized many of the critical points that served as the foundation of our case. It brought together, in dramatic fashion, the conduct of the police, the route that they took in pursuing the suspect.
We were able to hear their actual broadcasts, and we were able to see the relevant portions of the Cranston chase policy. And in my opinion, the juxtaposition of these various elements really bolstered our case …. These were experienced [defense] lawyers we were dealing with; they did a good job for their clients. But I thought that the audio-visual portion of the case had very real impact.
Q. Where is your client now, and what is her condition?
A. She’s still in Cranston. She’s confined to a wheelchair. She’s the mother of three and a very nice woman, and I’m just very pleased that her future will be at least a little less uncertain.

Medical Negligence Now Identified As The Third Leading Cause of Death In U.S.
As unbelievable as it may seem, a study undertaken by Johns Hopkins has concluded that medical negligence is now deemed to be the third leading cause of death in the U.S. behind heart disease and cancer. The facts surrounding this revelation are nothing short of staggering. For example, the study concludes that the majority of medical negligence incidents are typically unreported. This means that the documented 251,454 deaths occasioned last year by medical negligence omits entirely the larger number of unreported cases. It also omits deaths caused by negligence at nursing homes throughout the U.S. This trend has been in escalation for quite some time. For example, in 1999 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office reported that as many as 180,000 premature deaths were caused by medical negligence among Medicare patients alone.
Owing to disinformation perpetuated by a very effective, expensive and protracted marketing campaign, insurance companies have created the widely held impression that frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits have resulted in an exorbitant increase in physicians’ malpractice premiums. This phenomena, so the fiction goes, has both escalated the consumer’s cost of health care while driving a certain percentage of qualified physicians to leave their profession altogether. Nothing could be further from the truth, however. That the nation’s healthcare system is broken is undisputed. The reason for its dysfunction, however, is the endless bureaucracy and red tape machinated by the insurers themselves. As presently constituted, the system foists artificial burdens and barriers on doctors who, after all, should make recommendations and decisions based upon a patient’s need and not upon the need to successfully navigate the insurance industry’s draconian rules.
In Massachusetts, there are other safeguards to prevent meritless lawsuits against physicians. For example, in each instance, a Tribunal is convened in court which is comprised of a judge, a lawyer and a medical professional. Unless a majority of the tribunal is adequately convinced that a potential case has merit, the case is dismissed. This gate-keeping function, along with the not unsubstantial expense of pursuing a medical malpractice case usually discourages frivolous cases from being pursued in the first place.
Vigilance is the key to avoiding medical negligence. You should seek to be your own advocate and ask your doctor lots of questions to satisfy yourself that you are receiving appropriate care. To this end, there is no such thing as a “stupid” question. Seeking a second opinion is yet another way of increasing your odds of avoiding malpractice. While the United States enjoys the finest health care in the world, like all other things in life, it isn’t perfect. Your avid awareness and participation in your medical care ensures the best possible result.

A tragedy in Boston gives us an important lesson
This weekend brought a terrible tragedy to Boston. A young woman operating a moped was struck and killed by a so-called Duck Boat. Events like this should make everyone take a moment to try and appreciate how precious life is. And if you’re a parent, like me, that feeling is heightened.
None of us truly knows what tomorrow holds, and the stark truth of that statement is brought into focus when an accident like this occurs. Most mistakes that take place on a day in, day out basis have no consequences, thank God. But every once in a while a mistake has catastrophic consequence. Our hearts and prayers go out to the victim’s family. It’s hard to even conceive of receiving such a phone call.
After representing families who have endured similar fates, I can tell you that the responsible parties need to be held accountable. When you hear about an accident such as this, most people’s immediate reaction is to merely blame the operator of the vehicle that struck the victim. It’s been our experience, however, that someone needs to look deeper to find all responsible parties.
Truth be told, you can never really tell at the outset where the investigation will lead, but the need to drill down is there. Does the company skimp on safety; are their employees properly trained; was the vehicle in proper working order; are undue expectations placed on the drivers to meet schedules or deadlines, etc. It is as true as it is tragic to recognize that no law suit can ever bring a life back But thoroughly and aggressively investigating each detail will almost always bring about change that may save another’s life.

Whitmer taps charter school leader Doug Ross for senior adviser role

University Prep founder joins Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's office
Governor wants Ross to shape policies for higher education, talent
Ross respected on both sides of charter school debate
Doug Ross
Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has hired Detroit charter school leader Doug Ross to be a senior adviser focused on boosting the state's post-secondary education attainment rates and "fashion a coherent economic development policy," according to Ross.
"Those are two areas the governor has asked me to focus my energy on," Ross told Crain's.
Whitmer announced the appointment of Ross as "senior adviser for Michigan prosperity" late Monday afternoon on the eve of her first State of the State address to the Legislature.
"If we're going to ensure Michigan's success, we have to take a proactive approach to building talent and fostering an attractive environment for businesses to create jobs," Whitmer said in a statement. "I'm excited to work with Doug to build a state where more businesses move to for opportunity."
Ross, a Democrat and one-time U.S. assistant secretary of labor during President Bill Clinton's first term, founded University Prep in Detroit through American Promise Schools, a not-for-profit management company that takes over struggling charter schools.
He left America Promise Schools in 2017 for semi-retirement and to work on some education reform projects, including one that aimed to establish universal access to community colleges in Michigan.
"I know from her campaign, that we share a belief in increasing access considerably to post-secondary education and eliminating family income as an obstacle," Ross said in an interview.
Ross has been critical in the past of Michigan's disjointed system of educational governance where the elected members of the State Board of Education run the Department of Education and appoint the state superintendent of public instruction, while the governor is largely sidelined from educational policy-making and accountability.
"We need the buck to stop either with the governor's office or the state board, but not both," Ross said.
Whitmer wants Ross to work on developing strategies to boost Michigan's percentage of adults with a high-level certificate, associate's degree, bachelor's degree or higher.
Michigan ranks 36th in the country with a 43.7 percent post-secondary educational attainment rate among adults age 25 to 64, according to the Lumina Foundation.
"Nothing seems to correlate more with the earnings per capita of a state than the talent of its workforce," Ross said at an education reform forum in Detroit last year that was co-sponsored by Business Leaders for Michigan and The Center for Michigan.
Ross was founder and CEO of New Urban Learning, the nonprofit operator of the University Prep schools in Detroit.
As a state senator and candidate for governor, Whitmer was critical of charter schools run by for-profit management companies. She has not signaled how she'll treat independently run charter schools, though her powers as governor are limited.
"What her intent is as governor, I don't know — it's not a subject we've talked," Ross said.
A news release from Whitmer's office did not mention Ross' work in running charter schools in Detroit, which included a stint under former DPS Emergency Manager Roy Roberts running the district's charter schools office.
Ross is respected within the charter school movement and outside of it.
"Doug will bring in-depth knowledge of education in the K-12 space and higher education to the economic ideas they'll be talking about," said Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies, which lobbies for charter schools in Lansing. "Kudos to the administration."
David Hecker, president of the American Federation of Teachers-Michigan, which represents unionized Detroit teachers, said he has "no qualms" with Ross' appointment.
"We maintain a good relationship with Doug in spite of our differences at times," Hecker said. "I don't think Doug Ross is going to be in the governor's office advancing a charter school strategy. I think he's going to be advancing a strategy helping the state doing what we need to do."
Ross also is a former chief innovation officer for Detroit Public Schools, state senator and state commerce department director during former Gov. Jim Blanchard's administration in the 1980s.

Czepiga Daly Pope & Perri Attorneys Named Super Lawyers and Rising Star for Third Consecutive Year
Berlin, CT – June 18, 2013: Paul Czepiga, Brendan Daly and Carmine Perri of the elder law and estate planning law firm Czepiga Daly Pope & Perri, have all been honored as Connecticut Super Lawyers for 2013 by Super Lawyers Magazine. They were all previously named Super Lawyers in 2011 and 2012.
The three attorneys were singled out as Super Lawyers in the Elder Law practice area. Only five percent of the attorneys in the state are chosen for this special distinction. The magazine’s selection process begins with peer nominations of outstanding lawyers who have attained a high degree of peer recognition and professional achievement in their area of practice. Nominations are followed by independent research and peer evaluations of each attorney.
Carmine Perri was recognized as a “Rising Star,” the only one in CT. Rising Stars are lawyers under the age of 40 or who have been in practice for 10 years or less and are chosen as a result of surveys completed by recently recognized Super Lawyers. While up to five percent of Connecticut lawyers are named to Super Lawyers, no more than 2.5 percent are named to the Rising Stars list.

The sample table above is a small selection of common procedures discounted by these discount dental plans and programs. Once you're a member, you will be provided with a complete fee schedule (applicable for most plans) with discounted fees for nearly every dental procedure. The procedures discounted under these plans and programs offer similar savings to the sample above. If you are looking for a specific dental procedure that is not on this sample, please contact our Customer Care Center toll-free at 1-888-632-5353 with the ADA Code of the procedure and we can provide the discounted fee.
Fee schedules and savings may vary by ZIP code and by Provider within a ZIP code.
The dental provider listings on DentalPlans.com are provided directly from each dental network or discount dental plan, which are responsible for their accuracy and completeness. These listings are updated on a regular basis, and every effort has been made to ensure that only participating active providers are listed. We strongly recommend that you confirm that a provider is currently participating before you receive any services from that provider.
Discounted fees listed under "Routine Dental Fees", "Fillings & Crowns" and “Root Canals, Perio & Dentures” tabs are for participating General Dentists. Consult with your provider prior to beginning any treatment.

ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
Savings plans are NOT insurance and the savings will vary by provider, plan and zip code. These plans are not considered to be qualified health plans under the Affordable Care Act. Please consult with the respective plan detail page for additional plan terms. The discounts are available through participating healthcare providers only. To check that your provider participates, visit our website or call us. Since there is no paperwork or reimbursement, you must pay for the service at the time it’s provided. You will receive the discount off the provider’s usual and customary fees when you pay. We encourage you to check with your participating provider prior to beginning treatment.
ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
Special promotions including, but not limited to, additional months free are not available to California residents or on Fully Insured Plans. Note – not all plans and offers available in all markets.

ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
Savings plans are NOT insurance and the savings will vary by provider, plan and zip code. These plans are not considered to be qualified health plans under the Affordable Care Act. Please consult with the respective plan detail page for additional plan terms. The discounts are available through participating healthcare providers only. To check that your provider participates, visit our website or call us. Since there is no paperwork or reimbursement, you must pay for the service at the time it’s provided. You will receive the discount off the provider’s usual and customary fees when you pay. We encourage you to check with your participating provider prior to beginning treatment.
ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
Special promotions including, but not limited to, additional months free are not available to California residents or on Fully Insured Plans. Note – not all plans and offers available in all markets.

If you are looking for a specific dental procedure that is not on this sample, please contact our Customer Care Center toll-free at 1-888-632-5353 with the ADA Code of the procedure and we can provide the discounted fee.
Fee schedules and savings may vary by ZIP code and by Provider within a ZIP code.
The dental provider listings on DentalPlans.com are provided directly from each dental network or discount dental plan, which are responsible for their accuracy and completeness. These listings are updated on a regular basis, and every effort has been made to ensure that only participating active providers are listed. We strongly recommend that you confirm that a provider is currently participating before you receive any services from that provider.
Discounted fees listed under "Routine Dental Fees", "Fillings & Crowns" and “Root Canals, Perio & Dentures” tabs are for participating General Dentists. Consult with your provider prior to beginning any treatment.

The Denver Post
Fay King, The Post’s new cartoonist, sketched herself upon her arrival in Denver. April 18, 1912.
A writer, cartoonist and wit, Fay King arrived at The Denver Post in April 1912 with a self-portrait in the paper. The accompanying story described her as “the greatest woman cartoonist, caricaturist and ‘kidder’ in the world.” Her friends remembered her as “a petite pretty little woman with big eyes, bobbed hair and a notepad.” She was a rarity — a woman newspaper cartoonist.
In “Timber Line,” his often-fanciful history of the newspaper, Gene Fowler, her one-time companion, described her as “temperamental, capable of fainting when one of her numerous canary birds met with an accident, or of fighting a bobcat if necessary.”
Fay, who stood barely 5 feet tall, wrote a column of her travails while living in Denver, usually accompanied by one of her self-sketches that portrayed her as Olive Oyl-thin in a big, floppy hat and oversized feet. Her advice columns were headlined, “Fay King Tips Girls on Husband-Catching” and “Fay King Discovers Shop Talk.”
While he worked as a reporter at The Post, Fowler was assigned to do a story on the newly arrived King. They bonded instantly. He wrote in his biographical “A Solo in Tom-Toms,” “Beneath the carefree, gypsy personality of this girl lay the inflexible soul of a moralist. She had a puritanical code that she revealed only to those who knew her in private life.”
In 1913, she married noted boxer “Battling” Nelson, but it was a contentious marriage that ended in a very public divorce in 1916. She left The Post for the San Francisco Examiner in 1918 and later worked as a feature writer and cartoonist for the New York Evening Journal.

Public Release: 15-May-2014
Effects of alcohol in young binge drinkers predicts future alcoholism
University of Chicago Medical Center
Share
Print E-Mail
Heavy social drinkers who report greater stimulation and reward from alcohol are more likely to develop alcohol use disorder over time, report researchers from the University of Chicago, May 15 in the journal Biological Psychiatry. The findings run counter to existing hypotheses that innate tolerance to alcohol drives alcoholism.
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a team led by Andrea King, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, analyzed the subjective response of 104 young adult heavy social drinkers to alcohol and tracked their long-term drinking habits.
"Heavy drinkers who felt alcohol's stimulant and pleasurable effects at the highest levels in their 20s were the ones with the riskiest drinking profiles in the future and most likely to go on and have alcohol problems in their 30s," King said, "In comparison, participants reporting fewer positive effects of alcohol were more likely to mature out of binge drinking as they aged."
As part of a long-term study, King and her team carefully screened and studied heavy social drinkers who reported a pattern of binge drinking behavior as young adults -- at least four (for women) or five (for men) drinks per occasion, between one and five times per week. A group of light social drinkers was used as a control. Participants engaged in three sessions, in which they were given a placebo drink with only the smell of alcohol, a low dose of alcohol or a high dose. They then answered questionnaires, took performance and memory tests, and were sampled for levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
The initial assessment when the participants were in their 20s revealed that the heavy drinkers showed a strongly positive preference to alcohol, reporting greater stimulating effects, 'liking', and 'wanting more', with lower sedative and cortisol effects. Participants were then assessed in regular follow-ups to track their drinking behaviors and symptoms of addiction over time.
Six years later, the heavy drinkers, now with an average age in their early thirties, fell into three distinct trajectory groups of alcohol addiction symptoms --high, intermediate and low. Light drinkers formed one low-risk drinking group over time with no addiction symptoms so they were not further examined. Searching for how those initially measured alcohol responses might predict which group the participants fell into, King and her team found that those in the high alcohol addiction symptom group reported far higher stimulation and pleasure from alcohol effects than members of the low or intermediate groups. Tolerance to alcohol's fatiguing effects was less predictive of the future course of addiction.
"We knew that at age 25, there were binge drinkers who were sensitive to alcohol's more positive effects," King said. "We just didn't know what was going to happen to them. Now we show that they're the ones more likely to go on to experience more alcohol problems."
King and her colleagues are now engaged in pilot work to see if early intervention in drinkers with a positive response to alcohol is effective. They also continue to follow participants well into their 30's.
"Those who drink heavily might want to pay more attention to their response to alcohol for important warning signs," King said. "If you have sensitivity to the positive effects of alcohol, it might be better to moderate your use earlier than later."
###
The study, "Alcohol Challenge Responses Predict Future Alcohol Use Disorder Symptoms: A 6-Year Prospective Study," was supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the Alcoholic Beverage Medical Research Foundation, the University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, the National Center for Research Resources, the National Institutes of Health Roadmap for Medical Research and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Additional authors include Patrick J. McNamara, Deborah S. Hasin, and Dingcai Cao.

How much can late Permian ecosystems tell us about modern Earth? A lot
Field Museum

Print E-Mail
IMAGE: The lush equatorial ecosystem of the late Permian, about 260 milion years ago, as reconstructed in the Dolomites region, Northern Italy. view more
Credit: Drawing by Davide Bonadonna.
A whopping two hundred and fifty-two million years ago, Earth was crawling with bizarre animals, including dinosaur cousins resembling Komodo dragons and bulky early mammal-relatives, millions of years before dinosaurs even existed. New research shows us that the Permian equator was both a literal and figurative hotspot: it was, for the most part, a scorching hot desert, on top of having a concentration of unique animals. Here, you could find ancient crocodile-sized amphibians right next to newly evolved dinosaur and croc relatives. Many of these species were wiped out after an extinction which changed life on the planet forever.
In a paper published in Earth-Science Reviews, paleontologists studied fossil sites all over the world from the late Permian to get an idea of what lived where. They found an unusual assortment of species near the equator, and one that is comparable to the modern tropics--except that the array of large, carnivorous reptiles would look very out of place anywhere on Earth today.
"The tropics act as a diversity center--stuff that has gone extinct elsewhere is still alive there, and there's new stuff evolving," explains Postdoctoral Researcher Brandon Peecook, co-author of the paper. While it makes sense that the warm, wet rainforests we see now have incredible diversity, it seems counterintuitive that these fiery, hot deserts were home to an exceptional range of species, especially because diversity at the equator fluctuates so much historically.
"The tropics were a breeding ground for biodiversity, in the distant Permian as well as today," says the study's lead author Massimo Bernardi of MUSE - Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy.
The foundation of the research was observations made during fieldwork in Bletterbach Valley in northern Italy, which was located near the equator in the Permian. As Evelyn Kustatscher of the Museum of Nature South Tyrol explains: "The Bletterbach is a unique place because of the array of different species present. It's not that there were more individual species present than normal, but that the species that were there were really diverse and represented very different groups in the animal kingdom."
These findings about the late Permian beg the question, "Why are we seeing so much biodiversity at the equator?" This is something scientists have yet to answer, but it shows us that biodiversity at the tropics isn't intuitive, and isn't consistent. What scientists know for sure is that regardless of desert or rainforest, climate change negatively impacts living things.
This unequaled comparison of Permian climate and species distribution to modern events shows us that while many changes are natural and we see them throughout our planet's history, drastic changes like this can be triggered by something much larger--volcanic activity likely caused this in the Permian, and human activity is the suspected culprit today. After the Permian extinction, "it was almost as though the slate had been wiped clean, and all the ecosystems had to rebuild," says Peecook. This event altered life permanently and while new animals evolved and thrived, the process of recovery took millions of years, and the animals that were lost never returned.
"If we want to know how Earth's systems work, what's expected and what's normal, we need to look to the past," and the fossil record is the best measure of ecosystem stability. As we already begin to face extinctions and carbon levels similar to those before the Permian extinction, examining these patterns over time gives us the evidence we need to measure and minimize our impact on climate, preventing further permanent damage to our planet's ecosystems and animals.
###
The study is part of the research project "The end-Permian mass extinction in the Southern and Eastern Alps" developed by the Museum of Nature South Tyrol, Bolzano, Italy, the MUSE Science Museum, Trento, Italy and the Department of Geology of the University of Innsbruck, Austria. The research was also supported by grants from the National Science Foundation: EAR-1337291, EAR-1337569, and DEB-1501097.
The scientific article is freely accessible thanks to funding for scientific publications of the Research and University Service of the Bolzano Province, Italy.

Freezing breakthrough offers hope for African wild dogs
James Cook University
Share
Print E-Mail
James Cook University researchers in Australia have helped develop a new way to save endangered African wild dogs.
Dr Damien Paris and PhD student Dr Femke Van den Berghe from the Gamete and Embryology (GAME) Lab at James Cook University, have successfully developed a sperm freezing technique for the species (Lycaon pictus).
The highly efficient pack hunters have disappeared from most of their original range across sub-Saharan Africa due to habitat destruction, human persecution and canine disease, leaving less than 6,600 animals remaining in the wild.
Dr Paris said population management and captive breeding programs have begun, but there is a problem.
"One goal of the breeding programs is to ensure the exchange of genetic diversity between packs, which is traditionally achieved by animal translocations. But, due to their complex pack hierarchy, new animals introduced to an existing pack are often attacked, sometimes to the point of being killed," he said.
Dr Paris said the new sperm freezing technique could now be combined with artificial insemination to introduce genetic diversity into existing packs of dogs, without disrupting their social hierarchy.
Working with international canine experts Associate Professor Monique Paris (Institute for Breeding Rare and Endangered African Mammals), Dr Michael Briggs (African Predator Conservation Research Organization), and Professor. Wenche Farstad (Norwegian University of Life Sciences), Dr Paris and Dr Van den Berghe collected and froze semen from 24 males across 5 different packs using the new formulation.
After thawing sperm to test their survival, the team discovered most sperm remained alive, appeared normal and continued to swim for up to 8 hours.
"Sperm of this quality could be suitable for artificial insemination of African wild dog females to assist outbreeding efforts for the first time," said Dr Van den Berghe.
Dr Paris said he is determined the findings will reach zoo and wildlife managers in order to maximise the uptake of these techniques and develop a global sperm bank for the species.
As part of these efforts, the team have also presented these results at the International Congress on Animal Reproduction (France), African Painted Dog Conference (USA), and European Association of Zoo and Aquaria Conference (Netherlands).

The bankers have had a free ride for far too long
FORGET the idle threats of the big banks to leave the UK, the stockmarket yesterday told you all you need to know about the proposed reforms contained within the interim report of the Independent Commission on Banking led by Sir John Vickers.
By Ross Clark
PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:00, Tue, Apr 12, 2011
0
RBS and Lloyds are part-owned by the Government, which could veto any decision to leave
Barclays shares rose three per cent and those of the Royal Bank of Scotland two per cent. Even the shares of Lloyds, which the report suggests should be forced to sell off some of its branches, were up. Yes, once again, the banks have got off lightly. Having brought the economy to the brink of ruin and cost the taxpayer billions, the banking industry has effectively been told: fine, carry on just as before. There is nothing in this report which will stop a return to greedy practices which were commonplace before the banking crisis and have already returned to the City.
There are two main proposals contained within the Commission’s report. First, banks will in future have to maintain a capital base of at least 10 per cent, and secondly the retail parts of the big banks will have to be “ring-fenced” from their investment arms. Neither will significantly reduce the chances of another banking collapse. A capital base of 10 per cent – up from seven per cent at present – may sound vaguely reassuring, but it will mean nothing if banks do as they did last time and invest in dodgy US mortgage securities which turn out to be worthless: they will still go bust.
That shouldn’t in theory matter so long as the banks’ retail arms – the high street end of the operation through which you and I save and borrow – are protected from their investment arms: the City of London operation where all bond-trading, currency speculation and outright gambling takes place. But in practice you can be sure that bankers will if they possibly can still find ways to play poker with our life savings. Why else would the banks have resisted so fiercely an alternative suggestion made by economists: complete separation of retail and investment banking into separate companies?
The need to erect a complete barrier between the two was one of the big lessons from the Great Depression of the Thirties. Then, many American banks were brought down by reckless gambling with their depositors’ money. The US government responded with the Glass-Steagall Act limiting banks to either retail or investment activities. The reforms, echoed in Britain, kept the banking industry stable for most of the rest of the 20th century.
While banks occasionally failed – such as Johnson Matthey in 1984 and BCCI in 1991 – the damage was contained and ordinary depositors were not left in fear for their savings. But from the mid-Eighties onwards the regulations were weakened and then abolished, in response to lobbying by the banks. Then, as now, the big banks bleated that they would be unfairly restrained if they were not allowed to carry out retail banking and investment banking under the same roof. We all know what happened next: bankers grew extremely rich until the crunch came. They then temporarily suspended their belief in free market capitalism and ran off to governments pleading for a bail-out.
The problem was that the Government couldn’t say no: the banks had become so big that had they been allowed to fail. the cashpoints would have stopped working, our debit cards would have been rejected and a large number of us would have lost our life savings. No government can ever legislate completely against the possibility of a bank failing. But it can ensure that the failure of one bank does not lead inexorably to the collapse of the entire banking system, as very nearly happened in 2008.
It can do this by ensuring no bank is too big to fail. However, apart from suggesting that Lloyds sell off a few branches, the Independent Banking Commission has declined to do anything that would break up the big banks. This is perhaps of little surprise: ever since the bailouts, the banking industry has been engaged in a propaganda campaign to stave off any meaningful reforms. How many times over the past few months have you heard or read a banking chief threatening that his institution will leave Britain if it doesn’t like the reforms?
It is rather like a fish threatening to leave the sea. Yes, a strong banking sector is important to Britain, where financial services account for 10 per cent of the economy, more than any other large industrial nation. But the banks need us even more than we need them. They only continue to survive thanks to the implicit guarantee that the Government will bail them out if things go wrong again. Without that, the interest rates at which they can borrow money would soar.
Do they really think that the Cayman Islands government would offer them a similar guarantee – or Switzerland, China, the US or any other country? It is hard to see governments lining up to welcome a British bank to set up in their capital city. RBS and Lloyds are, in any case, part-owned by the Government, which could veto any decision to leave. It is clear what the bankers would like: to carry on enriching themselves knowing that the British taxpayer will always be there in a crisis. But there is no reason why the rest of us should let them get away with it, not after our money has been used to bail them out.
The Government, to be frank, has the banks by the short and curlies. It should show leadership by splitting them up and making sure they can never hold us to ransom ever again.

UK weather: Will the sun be replaced by SNOW? Britain set to be lashed by THUNDERSTORMS
SNOW could hit the UK following a Spring heatwave, with temperatures set to plunge after Britain is lashed by “intense thunderstorms”, as forecasters warn of frost.

This weeks hot weather, reaching 29C in some parts of the country, could be about to come to an abrupt end as forecasters warn of Thunderstorms, snow, and sleet.
The UK was blasted this week with record warm weather, as temperatures soared close to 30C.
Trailing the hottest April day for 70 years, which peaked at 29.1C in London, the weekend continued the trend of unseasonably warm weather.
However, temperatures could drop to as low as -2C or -3C in parts of Scotland as a cold snap batters the UK.

Parts of Wales, Scotland and England could be hit with sleet and even snow showers.
The Met Office warned showers will move in from south-west England into the Midlands throughout the week, escalating into hail storms and even surface flooding by the time it reaches Yorkshire.
Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern declared that the increased humidity from the weekend will be responsible for “hit and miss thunderstorms”.
He explained: “The humidity will build through Saturday and then for south-west England, Wales and then across the Midlands and especially northern England there is the risk of intense thunderstorms developing.

Temperature reached 29C in London this week
“Later, these will push into East Anglia and the south-east of England before clearing.
“They do move through fairly quickly but if we are caught in one of these intense thunderstorms, hit and miss thunderstorms.”
The thunderstorms will clear out the humid air for the rest of the week, as temperature drop.
The London Marathon saw temperature reach 23C, causing problems for runners in the early hours of Sunday morning
Temperatures are predicted to hit 24C in the capital, but colder winds and rain could sweep in.
GETTY
Temperatures could plummet, producing snow in the North
Warmer weather is expected to remain in southern parts of the UK, as freezing temperatures frost over in the north.
Leon Brown, chief forecaster at The Weather Channel, said: “It will be quite a lot colder from the middle of next week for the west and northwest.
"Gardeners should beware ground frosts later next week.
"We may see air frosts by the end of next week too with temperatures -2 or -3C in Scotland.
“Showers will be wintry over higher ground with models for Wednesday evening indicating a slight covering of snow over the higher parts of the UK from Wales northwards and especially Scottish Highlands - typically above 300 to 400m.”
By midweek there are some signs of sleet and snow showers falling over higher ground across the Pennines, north Scottish mountains, Wales and northern England where temperatures could fall close to freezing.

Leon Brown added: “The beginning of the change will be this Sunday as cooler Atlantic air moves eastwards.
“This may trigger some heavy downpours over eastern England during Sunday afternoon.
"We will have to watch out for flash flooding locally.
"I expect we will see hail and some heavy April showers next Wednesday and Thursday across much of the UK, cracks of thunder possible too.”
From mid next week, cloud and outbreaks of rain in the snow-less south east should clear leaving most areas with a mix of sunny spells and blustery showers - the heaviest of which will be in the north and west.
Rain and strong winds should clear by Thursday morning in the west, bringing sunshine and showers once again.

Manchester United HIT BACK over LMA's Moyes' sacking criticism
MANCHESTER UNITED have hit back at claims from the League Managers' Association that David Moyes' sacking was handled unprofessionally.
By Ben Jefferson

David Moyes' sacking was not confirmed until Tuesday morning[GETTY]
LMA chief executive Richard Bevan had expressed his disappointment that Moyes' sacking was widely reported by news media before the Scot had been spoken to by the club.
But United insist that at the time the reports first emerged, no decision had been taken.
Indeed, the club say the final call to sack Moyes was not made until late Monday night and then communicated directly first thing on Tuesday morning.
A United club spokesman said:"We do not accept that it was handled in an unprofessional manner."

Earlier Bevan had chastised United for their handling of the matter.
He said: "The LMA is very disappointed with the nature of David's departure from Manchester United, and to read extensive reports in the press confirming David's sacking before David himself had been spoken to officially by the club.
"Throughout his time at United, David, as he always does, has conducted himself with integrity and professionalism, values that he believes in and that have been strongly associated with the club and its rich tradition.
"It is therefore sad to see the end of David's tenure at United being handled in an unprofessional manner."

Berliners: raise your voice against racism and in support of tolerance
type:
Donation, NGO, Protest, Volunteering
by:
Yair Oded
Across the world, far-right elements have penetrated the socio-political discourse— garnering rising support of local populations by touting xenophobic sentiments and a rhetoric of “us” vs. “them”. They inspire hatred and suspicion by capitalizing on people’s most primal fears, prejudices, and insecurities— both financial and cultural.
As a result, oppression of racial minorities, immigrants, refugees, and women has exacerbated dramatically.
The Coalition Berlin is a Berlin-based NGO committed to dispelling racist and hateful sentiments and inspiring tolerance and social-equality.
They do so through a series of events, community actions, and rallies across the German capital.
“We will speak up against injustice and oppression wherever it occurs. We do not accept a world in which hate is used as a weapon and diversity seen as a threat.” the Coalition members declare in their manifesto.
Visit their website to learn more about their mission, event calendar, and ways in which you can get involved.

Sign the People vs. Oil petition to end the age of oil
type:
Petition
by:
Yair Oded
The disastrous effects of the oil industry on our planet are acutely visible.
As stated by the IPCC in their 2018 report, the international community has to drastically reduce emissions by 2030 in order to prevent the worst impacts of global warming. This means divesting from oil and embracing new energy production technology.
Emboldened by a series of court victories against oil giants and successful climate initiatives launched by communities, civilians, nonprofits, and governments from across the globe— Greenpeace seek to step up the game and ensure that oil becomes a feature of the past.
Support Greenpeace by signing their People vs. Oil petition calling on global leaders to ban all new oil development and extraction, phase out production and sales of oil-operated vehicles, and transition to “people-centered, renewable energy and transport systems.”
You may also help by spreading the news and circulating the petition in your networks and social media platforms.
Time is of the essence. Every vote counts.
Let’s end oil. For good.

Protect the rights of immigrants in the U.S. and call for the end of their abuse
type:
Donation, NGO, Volunteering
by:
Yair Oded
Treatment of immigrants in the United States (both documented and undocumented) is worsening rapidly. What was already a harsh reality for immigrants in previous years, has devolved under the current administration to an absolute nightmare— as the government issues more and more decrees that complicate the immigration and asylum process and render them increasingly treacherous and inaccessible.
Meanwhile, across the country, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has morphed into nothing short of an anti-immigrant army— employing inhumane tactics to intimidate immigrants and arrest them in their homes, jobs, in the streets, and even at courthouses while their non-immigration related cases are being deliberated.
The Immigrant Defense Project is a nonprofit organization working to protect immigrants (both documented and undocumented) across the United States. Among their many projects and campaigns, the organization provides tools and information for immigrants who are at risk of deportations and inform them of their rights.
They also launched an interactive map called ICE Watch, which tracks the location, time, and story of ICE raids committed in the northeast, and provide detailed information about recent tactics they employ to apprehend immigrants.
The organization lobbies with government and legislative authorities on behalf of immigrants in order to cease arrests at courthouses and halt deportations of immigrants who commit petty crimes, and adopt more substantial laws protecting them from abuse and arbitrary imprisonment and deportation by the immigration authorities.
They also provide training to litigators and volunteers dealing with immigration and immigrant detention cases.
Please visit their website to further acquaint yourself with the reality of immigrants in the U.S., learn about your rights as an immigrant, and figure out how you can help defend them as a lawyer or volunteer.

Support DRC’s persecuted journalists and freedom fighters
type:
Donation, NGO
by:
Yair Oded
Stability has yet to reach the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country which has known incessant bloodshed, conflict, corruption, and poverty since the 1970’s. After 18 years in power, DRC’s leader, Joseph Kabila, has announced an election in which he ultimately lost to to Felix Tshisekedi, who took power in January 2019. Many argue, however, that Tshisekedi’s victory resulted from fraudulent elections, as his opponent, Martin Fayulu, was projected to win by a landslide. The growing assumption is that Tshisekedi had made a deal with Kabila, allowing him and the elite to remain involved in the country’s affairs.
Furthermore, while DRC’s government and financial elite have looted the country’s natural resources (through the support of greedy Western governments and corporations), the local population has been thrown into a growing humanitarian crisis- as poverty and disease ravage Congolese people across the country. Freedom of speech and dissent have been utterly stifled by the regime, and killings, abuse, and intimidation of journalists and political activists has been rife.
As Western governments and corporations gain from DR Congo’s corrupt regime, they are reluctant to exert any pressure on its authorities to adopt Democratic principles of governance. It is up to the people of the world, therefore, to raise their voice and join the Congolese people in their demand for justice.
Front Line Defenders (FDL), an NGO that monitors and supports human rights activists across the globe, has placed one of its focuses on the situation in DRC. FDL regularly publish and track cases of individuals harassed and arrested by the authorities in DRC for their humanitarian work and expression of dissent.
FDL also provide financial and medical aid to such local activists who face abuse or prosecution by the government.
Please visit their website to learn more about the situation unfolding in the DRC, and make sure that the country’s freedom fighters are supported by the international community.

Urge UN to monitor and prevent human rights violations in Western Sahara
type:
NGO, Petition
by:
Yair Oded
For decades, the Saharawi people of Western Sahara have been pushing for independence from Morocco, which refuses to relinquish control of the region. Last December, another failed round of talks between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front has left Western Saharans under grave uncertainty regarding their future.
While the United Nations maintains its presence in the area through MINURSO (the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara), it fails to oversee the humanitarian situation in the region and curb the numerous human rights violations taking place there— including gross violation of freedom of expression, movement, assembly, and the right to fair trial and freedom from torture.
Western Sahara Action Forum (WSAF) is a nonprofit working to pressure the UN Security council to establish a human rights monitoring mechanism in Western Sahara alongside the renewal of the MINURSO mandate— until a free and fair referendum takes place to determine the future of the region’s residents.
In addition to gathering and circulating information regarding human rights abuses in the region, WSAF take actions to raise the issues with those in charge at the United Nations.
One of their campaigns invites supporters to draft and send letters to members of the UN Security Council regarding the issue.
Please visit their website to learn how you can help pressure the international community to take a stronger stance against human rights violations in a conflict zone that often fails to reach the public’s attention.

This NGO gives thousands of Kenyan youths a ticket to a better future. Support their efforts today.
type:
Donation, Volunteering
by:
Yair Oded
Kenya’s youth is in a challenging position. Research shows that 1 in 5 Kenyans between the ages of 15-24, who are eligible for employment, are unemployed. In turn, high unemployment rates increase these youths’ exposure to criminal activity, teen pregnancy, prostitution, and dire poverty. This puts an already vulnerable population at an even greater risk.
Since 2001, Raising Futures Kenya have been working tirelessly to provide the country’s youth with employment opportunities and guarantee their prosperity and well-being (as well as those of their families).
Through a network of volunteers, Raising Futures Kenya collaborate with individuals, other NGOs, and local government to provide training to young Kenyans in various fields, with which they could later on find employment or beginning their own small business (a process through which Raising Futures assist them).
The organization places special focus on children and teenagers with disabilities, who are still largely discriminated against in Kenya and often have no access to vocational training, education, or employment. Raising Futures collaborate with schools that specialize in education for children with disabilities and provide them with more resources to meet the needs of these children.
The organization also focuses on the advancement of girls, who also suffer from discrimination in education and employment, compared to male Kenyans. In fact, 72% of the program’s attendees are girls, who receive vocational training and support in launching their own businesses.
Raising Futures Kenya have thus far educated and trained more than 2,000 youths. 86% of their graduates are either employed or self-employed and 89% of them contribute to their family’s needs every month.
What’s more, is that an estimated 50% of graduates currently monitor and support others in their community, which through a trickle-down effect ensures the prosperity and improvement of others around them.
If you are interested in volunteering with Raising Futures, please visit their website.
If volunteering isn’t an option for you, please consider donating to their important cause.

WWF protect our oceans, rivers, forests, and wildlife. Learn how you can contribute.
type:
Donation, NGO, Volunteering
by:
Yair Oded
As climate change exacerbates due to human activity and natural resources dwindle, both humans and animals suffer great habitat loss, and a growing number of wildlife species are at risk of extinction.
WWF is a United Kingdom-based independent conservation organization, whose primary goal is to “to create a world where people and wildlife can thrive together.”
Through a global network of members and volunteers, WWF work to encourage people to live sustainably and espouse practices that minimize their impact on the environment.
One of their main methods of operation is to apply pressure on and provide guidance to governments, companies, and organizations, working tirelessly behind the scenes to promote green and sustainable policies that would protect wildlife and natural resources and reduce carbon emissions. Just last year, WWF campaign successfully urged major banks across the UK to implement policies that would safeguard World Heritage sites.
Another successful campaign of WWF is one through which people may ‘adopt’ an endangered animal and thus learn more about the risks it faces as well as of actions taken to protect it.
From forests to oceans to freshwater and frozen environments- WWF maintains a presence across the globe, drawing public attention to conservation crises, educating communities and institutions about ways in which they can contribute, as well as aggressively pushing for sustainable policy reforms in order to mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change.
VWWF also holds events (such as marathons, for instance) to raise awareness of their cause and help fund-raise.
Please visit their website to learn about ways in which you can contribute: either by attending events, volunteering, fundraising and campaigning for the organization, or donating.

The Great Green Wall: Africa’s ticket to environmental and economic sustainability
type:
Petition
by:
Yair Oded
Faced with increasing rates of climate change related catastrophes, famine, terrorism, and migration of young individuals and families towards Europe, African nations decided to take matters into their own hands and save their citizens’ future.
Their solution? An 8,000 km wall of trees planted across the entire width of Africa, stretching from Senegal in West Africa all the way to Djibouti in East Africa.
The Great Green Wall initiative was established by 11 African nations along the Sahara Desert border- Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Senegal, with each country responsible to establish a plan to fund and organize the planting of this natural belt in cooperation with local communities.
The Great Green Wall, 15 percent of which is currently built, aims to stop the expansion of the Sahara desert, restore tens of millions of hectares of degraded land and employment sources, as well as absorb 250 million tons of CO2 from the atmosphere.
Decades of extreme weather conditions- in the form of worsening droughts and land degradation- combined with a steadily rising population explosion in various regions of the Sahara desert have led to severe shortages of farming and employment opportunities and poor access to essential resources. Frustrated and hopeless, many young individuals in the region either turn to extreme terrorist groups or attempt to migrate to Europe for a better future.
Already, the Great Green Wall has managed to tame and reverse some of these adverse phenomena, and spawned positive developments in the region. According to EURACTIV, for instance, “over four million hectares of previously degraded land have been restored with the planting of over 27,000 hectares of indigenous trees” in Senegal. The fruits produced by the trees have also contributed to the emergence of a whole new market along the green wall, which provides employment prospects for young people in the area.
The project has been endorsed by international bodies, such as the European Union and World Bank. At the UN Climate Change Summit in Paris last December, the member nations pledged to contribute $4 billion to the construction of the Great Green Wall.
It seems that as far as construction of walls is concern, the U.S. president should turn to his counterparts in Africa for some urgently needed advice.
As stated in the words of Dr James Wahonye from the University of Nairobi Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies (during an interview for EURACTIV), “The problems in the Sahel should not be treated in isolation. We are in a global village and any threat, especially one of this magnitude, should get the whole world’s attention because it is just a matter of time before it mutates to the rest of the world.”
To sign their petition and pledge your support for the Great Green Wall, please visit their website.

Help save the lives of migrants crossing the desert
type:
Donation, NGO, Volunteering
by:
Yair Oded
On any given day, countless migrants seeking refuge in the U.S. find themselves in a race for survival as they cross the arid desert spanning between Mexico and South-western U.S.
One of the most dangerous crossing points is the Sonora desert, which extends from northern Mexico into Southern Arizona. Over the past two decades, the Sonora has become infamous as the death toll of migrants dying while crossing it increased exponentially.
As government agencies are failing (or unwilling) to provide sufficient aid to migrants in distress, and in some cases reportedly abuse those they ‘catch’, numerous organizations have set out to extend a helping hand to those whose lives are at risk in Sonora.
One of these organizations is No More Deaths (NMD). Since 2004, NMD has been operating as a nonprofit dedicated to saving the lives of migrants crossing the desert into Southern Arizona and advocate on their behalf.
NMD volunteers engage in a number of activities to decrease the number of migrants dying throughout their arduous journey to safety and ensure that their rights are acknowledged and respected.
Their campaigns include distribution of humanitarian aid (water, food, first aid kits, blankets, and clothes) along the remote Sonora areas in both Southern Arizona and mexico, provision of legal assistance to migrants applying for asylum or facing deportations, assistance with locating family members gone missing in the desert, and support of border communities.
NMD also document abuse of migrants by border patrol agents and government officials, work to increase public awareness of their plight, and actively promote human immigration policies and reforms.
Regrettably, the current administration (as well as various officials in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife agencies in the area) is laboring to criminalize NMD volunteers who provide humanitarian aid on the ground for migrants in distress. Only recently, charges were pressed against nine different NMD volunteers who entered the Cabeza Prieta Wildlife Refuge in order to leave water and food for migrants.
Shortly before charges were pressed against him, NMD volunteer Scott Warren stated the following in an essay published in the South Atlantic Quarterly, “Humanitarian aid drops of water, food, socks, and blankets serve to acknowledge the struggle of migrants and force land managers and the public to recognize the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Simply put, the very presence of humanitarian aid forces land managers to publicly acknowledge a problem that they may wish to push into the remotest and least touristed areas of the desert, keeping it invisible to everyone but law enforcement personnel.”
Warren’s words highlight the importance and urgency of bringing the plight of migrants crossing the desert into the heart of national debate and public attention. Now is the time to ensure that migrant lives will no longer be viewed as expendable.
To learn more about their mission or how you can get involved, please visit No More Death’s Website. Their campaign can and should be supported from across the globe.

500 Startups founder explodes over Trump: “If you’re not f—— pissed right now, what is wrong with you?”
By Marcus Baram 1 minute Read
Dave McClure, the founder of Silicon Valley startup accelerator 500 Startups, exploded in anger over Trump’s victory while on stage at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon. (h/t Business Insider)
“If you’re not fucking pissed right now, what is wrong with you?” McClure said. “What is fucking wrong with you if you’re not pissed right now? We provide communication platforms for the rest of the fucking country and we are allowing shit to happen, just like the cable news networks, just like talk radio. It’s a propaganda meeting. Even if people aren’t aware of the shit that they’re being told, if they’re being told a story in fear, if they’re being told a story of ‘other,’ if they’re not understanding that people are trying to use them to get into fucking office, then yes, assholes like Trump are going to take office. And it’s our duty and our responsibility as entrepreneurs, as citizens of the fucking world, to make sure that shit does not happen. This shit will not stand, and you’ve got to fight for your rights and… stand the fuck up!”
Wow, @davemcclure has a MELTDOWN on #WebSummit stage over Donald Trump election pic.twitter.com/aRJmFpYyQA

I. Introduction
On November 6, 2013, NYSE Arca, Inc. (“Exchange” or “NYSE Arca”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) [1] and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] a proposed rule change to amend the description of the means of achieving the investment objective applicable to the PIMCO Total Return Exchange Traded Fund (“Fund”) relating to its use of derivative instruments. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on November 26, 2013.[3] On January 9, 2014, the Commission designated a longer period within which to approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.[4] On February 24, 2014, the Commission instituted proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.[5] On April 15, 2014, the Exchange submitted Amendments No. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change.[6] On May 21, 2014, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,[7] the Commission designated a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change.[8] The Commission received no comments Start Printed Page 44225on the proposal. This order grants approval of the proposed rule change.
II. Description of the Proposed Rule Change
The Commission previously approved the listing and trading of shares (“Shares”) of the Fund under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600, which governs the listing and trading of Managed Fund Shares on the Exchange.[9] The Shares are offered by PIMCO ETF Trust (“Trust”), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company.[10] The investment manager to the Fund is Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (“PIMCO” or “Adviser”).
In the Prior Release, the Exchange stated that, consistent with the Trust's Exemptive Order, the Fund would not invest in options contracts, futures contracts, or swap agreements.[11] In view of the No-Action Letter issued by staff in the Commission's Division of Investment Management on December 6, 2012, the Exchange proposes to change this representation to permit the Fund to use derivative instruments, as described below, and makes the following representations and statements.[12]
The Prior Release stated that the Fund will invest under normal market circumstances at least 65% of its total assets in a diversified portfolio of Fixed Income Instruments of varying maturities.[13] “Fixed Income Instruments” include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities.[14] The Exchange proposes to revise this statement to provide that the Fund will invest under normal market circumstances at least 65% of its total assets in a diversified portfolio of Fixed Income Instruments of varying maturities, which may be represented by derivatives related to Fixed Income Instruments (“65% policy”).
The Prior Release stated that the Fund's investment would not be used to enhance leverage. In view of the Exchange's proposal to permit the Fund to use derivative instruments, as described below, the Fund's investments in derivative instruments may be used to enhance leverage. However, as noted in the Prior Release, the Fund's investments will not be used to seek performance that is the multiple or inverse multiple (e.g., 2Xs and 3Xs) of the Fund's broad-based securities market index.
The Fund's Use of Derivatives
The Exchange states that, with respect to the Fund, derivative instruments primarily will include forwards, exchange-traded and over-the-counter (“OTC”) options contracts, exchange-traded futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and swap agreements. Generally, derivatives are financial contracts whose values depend upon, or are derived from, the values of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index, and may relate to stocks, bonds, interest rates, currencies or currency exchange rates, commodities, and related indexes. The Fund may, but is not required to, use derivative instruments for risk management purposes or as part of its investment strategies.[15]
The Exchange represents that the Fund's investments in derivative instruments will be made in accordance with the 1940 Act and consistent with the Fund's investment objective and policies. As described further below, the Fund will typically use derivative instruments as a substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as interest rate or currency risk. The Fund may also use derivative instruments to enhance returns. To limit the potential risk associated with such transactions, the Fund will segregate or “earmark” assets determined to be liquid by PIMCO in accordance with procedures established by the Trust's Board of Trustees and in accordance with the 1940 Act (or, as permitted by applicable regulation, enter into certain offsetting positions) to cover its obligations under derivative instruments. These procedures have been adopted consistent with Section 18 of the 1940 Act and related Commission guidance. In addition, the Fund will Start Printed Page 44226include appropriate risk disclosure in its offering documents, including leveraging risk. Leveraging risk is the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, including the Fund's use of derivatives, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged.[16] Because the markets for certain securities, or the securities themselves, may be unavailable or cost prohibitive as compared to derivative instruments, suitable derivative transactions may be an efficient alternative for the Fund to obtain the desired asset exposure.
The Exchange states that the Adviser believes derivatives can be an economically attractive substitute for an underlying physical security that the Fund would otherwise purchase. For example, the Fund could purchase Treasury futures contracts instead of physical Treasuries or could sell credit default protection on a corporate bond instead of buying a physical bond. Economic benefits include potentially lower transaction costs or attractive relative valuation of a derivative versus a physical bond (e.g., differences in yields).
The Exchange states the Adviser further believes that derivatives can be used as a more liquid means of adjusting portfolio duration as well as targeting specific areas of yield curve exposure, with potentially lower transaction costs than the underlying securities (e.g., interest rate swaps may have lower transaction costs than physical bonds). Similarly, money market futures can be used to gain exposure to short-term interest rates in order to express views on anticipated changes in central bank policy rates. In addition, derivatives can be used to protect client assets through selectively hedging downside (or “tail risks”) in the Fund.
The Exchange states that the Fund also can use derivatives to increase or decrease credit exposure. Index credit default swaps (CDX) can be used to gain exposure to a basket of credit risk by “selling protection” against default or other credit events, or to hedge broad market credit risk by “buying protection.” Single name credit default swaps (CDS) can be used to allow the Fund to increase or decrease exposure to specific issuers, saving investor capital through lower trading costs. The Fund can use total return swap contracts to obtain the total return of a reference asset or index in exchange for paying a financing cost. A total return swap may be much more efficient than buying underlying securities of an index, potentially lowering transaction costs.
The Exchange states that the Adviser believes that the use of derivatives will allow the Fund to selectively add diversifying sources of return from selling options. Options purchases and sales can also be used to hedge specific exposures in the portfolio, and can provide access to return streams available to long-term investors such as the persistent difference between implied and realized volatility. Options strategies can generate income or improve execution prices (i.e., covered calls).
Other Investments
In addition to the Fund's use of derivatives in connection with the 65% policy, under the proposal, the Fund would seek to invest in derivative instruments not based on Fixed Income Instruments, consistent with the Fund's investment restrictions relating to exposure to those asset classes.
The Prior Release stated that the Fund may invest in debt securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign (non-U.S.) countries. The Prior Release stated further that PIMCO generally considers an instrument to be economically tied to a non-U.S. country if the issuer is a foreign government (or any political subdivision, agency, authority or instrumentality of such government), or if the issuer is organized under the laws of a non-U.S. country. In the case of applicable money market instruments, such instruments will be considered economically tied to a non-U.S. country if either the issuer or the guarantor of such money market instrument is organized under the laws of a non-U.S. country.
The Exchange proposes to add to this representation that, with respect to derivative instruments, as proposed to be used, PIMCO generally will consider such instruments to be economically tied to non-U.S. countries if the underlying assets are foreign currencies (or baskets or indexes of such currencies), or instruments or securities that are issued by foreign governments (or any political subdivision, agency, authority, or instrumentality of such governments) or issuers organized under the laws of a non-U.S. country (or if the underlying assets are money market instruments, as applicable, if either the issuer or the guarantor of such money market instruments is organized under the laws of a non-U.S. country).
The Fund's investments, including investments in derivative instruments, are subject to all of the restrictions under the 1940 Act, including restrictions with respect to illiquid securities. The Fund may hold up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities (calculated at the time of investment), including Rule 144A securities deemed illiquid by the Adviser, consistent with Commission guidance. The Fund will monitor its portfolio liquidity on an ongoing basis to determine whether, in light of current circumstances, an adequate level of liquidity is being maintained, and will consider taking appropriate steps in order to maintain adequate liquidity if, through a change in values, net assets, or other circumstances, more than 15% of the Fund's net assets are held in illiquid securities. Illiquid securities include securities subject to contractual or other restrictions on resale and other instruments that lack readily available markets as determined in accordance with Commission staff guidance.
The Exchange states that this proposal would become effective upon (i) the effectiveness of an amendment to the Trust's Registration Statement disclosing the Fund's intended use of derivative instruments and (ii) when this proposed rule change has become operative. The Exchange further states that the Adviser has managed and will continue to manage the Fund in the manner described in the Prior Release, and will not implement the proposed changes until this proposed rule change has become operative. In addition, the Exchange represents that there is no change to the Fund's investment objective and that the Fund will continue to comply with all initial and continued listing requirements under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600. Except for the changes noted above, the Exchange represents that all other facts presented and representations made in the Prior Release remain unchanged.
Derivatives Valuation Methodology for Purposes of Determining Net Asset Value
According to the Exchange, the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Fund's Shares is determined by dividing the total value of the Fund's portfolio investments and other assets, less any liabilities, by the total number of Shares outstanding. Fund Shares are valued as of the close of regular trading (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (“E.T.”)) (“NYSE Close”) on each day NYSE Arca is open (“Business Day”). Information that becomes known to the Fund or its agents after the NAV has been calculated on a particular day will not generally be used to retroactively adjust Start Printed Page 44227the price of a portfolio asset or the NAV determined earlier that day. The Fund reserves the right to change the time its NAV is calculated if the Fund closes earlier, or as permitted by the Commission.
The Exchange states that for purposes of calculating NAV, portfolio securities and other assets for which market quotes are readily available are valued at market value. Market value is generally determined on the basis of last reported sales prices, or if no sales are reported, based on quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system, established market makers, or pricing services. Domestic and foreign fixed income securities and non-exchange-traded derivatives will normally be valued on the basis of quotes obtained from brokers and dealers or pricing services using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal markets for those assets. Prices obtained from independent pricing services use information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. Exchange-traded options, futures, and options on futures will generally be valued at the settlement price determined by the applicable exchange. Derivatives for which market quotes are readily available will be valued at market value. Local closing prices will be used for all instrument valuation purposes. For the Fund's 4:00 p.m. E.T. futures holdings, estimated prices from Reuters will be used if any cumulative futures margin impact is greater than $0.005 to the NAV due to futures movement after the fixed income futures market closes (3:00 p.m. E.T.) and up to the NYSE Close (generally 4:00 p.m. E.T.). Swaps traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange will use the applicable exchange closing price where available.
Derivatives Valuation Methodology for Purposes of Determining Intra-Day Indicative Value
According to the Exchange, on each Business Day, before commencement of trading in Fund Shares on NYSE Arca, the Fund discloses on its Web site the identities and quantities of the portfolio instruments and other assets held by the Fund that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of NAV at the end of the Business Day.
In order to provide additional information regarding the intra-day value of Shares of the Fund, NYSE Arca or a market data vendor disseminates every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association or other widely disseminated means an updated Intra-day Indicative Value (“IIV”) for the Fund as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor.
The Exchange states that a third party market data provider is currently calculating the IIV for the Fund. For the purposes of determining the IIV, the third party market data provider's valuation of derivatives is expected to be similar to their valuation of all securities. The third party market data provider may use market quotes if available or may fair value securities against proxies (such as swap or yield curves).
According to the Exchange, with respect to specific derivatives:
Foreign currency derivatives may be valued intraday using market quotes, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
Futures may be valued intraday using the relevant futures exchange data, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
Interest rate swaps may be mapped to a swap curve and valued intraday based on changes of the swap curve, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
CDX/CDS may be valued using intraday data from market vendors, or based on underlying asset price, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
Total return swaps may be valued intraday using the underlying asset price, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
Exchange listed options may be valued intraday using the relevant exchange data, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
OTC options may be valued intraday through option valuation models (e.g., Black-Scholes) or using exchange traded options as a proxy, or another proxy as determined to be appropriate by the third party market data provider.
Disclosed Portfolio
The Exchange states that the Fund's disclosure of derivative positions in the Disclosed Portfolio will include information that market participants can use to value these positions intraday. On a daily basis, the Fund will disclose on the Fund's Web site the following information regarding each portfolio holding, as applicable to the type of holding: Ticker symbol, CUSIP number or other identifier, if any; a description of the holding (including the type of holding, such as the type of swap); the identity of the security, commodity, index or other asset or instrument underlying the holding, if any; for options, the option strike price; quantity held (as measured by, for example, par value, notional value or number of shares, contracts or units); maturity date, if any; coupon rate, if any; effective date, if any; market value of the holding; and the percentage weighting of the holding in the Fund's portfolio.
Impact on Arbitrage Mechanism
The Exchange states that the Adviser believes there will be minimal, if any, impact to the arbitrage mechanism as a result of the use of derivatives. Market makers and participants should be able to value derivatives as long as the positions are disclosed with relevant information. The Exchange states that the Adviser believes that the price at which Shares trade will continue to be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to purchase or redeem creation Shares at their NAV, which should ensure that Shares will not trade at a material discount or premium in relation to their NAV.
The Exchange states that, according to the Adviser, there will not be any significant impacts to the settlement or operational aspects of the Fund's arbitrage mechanism due to the use of derivatives. Because derivatives generally are not eligible for in-kind transfer, they will typically be substituted with a “cash in lieu” amount when the Fund processes purchases or redemptions of creation units in-kind.
Surveillance
The Exchange represents that trading in the Shares will be subject to the existing trading surveillances, administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on behalf of the Exchange, which are designed to detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws.[17] The Exchange represents that these procedures are adequate to properly monitor Exchange trading of the Shares in all trading sessions and to deter and detect violations of Exchange rules and applicable federal securities laws.
The surveillances referred to above generally focus on detecting securities trading outside their normal patterns, Start Printed Page 44228which could be indicative of manipulative or other violative activity. When such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened, where appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading violations.
FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, will communicate as needed regarding trading in the Shares, exchange traded options, futures, and options on futures with other markets or other entities that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (“ISG”), and FINRA may obtain trading information regarding trading in the Shares, exchange traded options, futures, and options on futures from such markets or entities. In addition, the Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in the Shares, exchange traded options, futures, and options on futures from markets or other entities that are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.[18] In addition, FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, is able to access, as needed, trade information for certain fixed income securities held by the Fund reported to FINRA's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”). The Exchange also states that it has a general policy prohibiting the distribution of material, non-public information by its employees.
Additional information regarding the Trust, the Fund, and the Shares, including investment strategies, risks, NAV calculation, creation and redemption procedures, fees, portfolio holdings, disclosure policies, distributions and taxes is included in the Prior Release, Notice, and the Registration Statement, as applicable.[19]
III. Discussion and Commission's Findings
The Commission has carefully reviewed the proposed rule change and finds that it is consistent with the requirements of Section 6 of the Act [20] and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.[21] In particular, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,[22] which requires, among other things, that the Exchange's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission notes that the Fund and the Shares must comply with the requirements of NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 to continue to be listed and traded on the Exchange.
The Commission notes that, with respect to its proposed investments in derivatives, the Fund will seek, where possible, to use counterparties whose financial status is such that the risk of default is reduced. The Exchange states that PIMCO's Counterparty Risk Committee will evaluate the creditworthiness of counterparties on an ongoing basis. In addition to information provided by credit agencies, PIMCO credit analysts will evaluate each approved counterparty using various methods of analysis, including company visits, earnings updates, the broker-dealer's reputation, PIMCO's past experience with the broker-dealer, market levels for the counterparty's debt and equity, the counterparty's liquidity, and its share of market participation.
In addition, according to the Exchange, the proposed investments in derivative instruments will be made in accordance with the 1940 Act and consistent with the Fund's investment objective and policies. To further limit the potential risk associated with such transactions, the Fund will segregate or “earmark” assets determined to be liquid by PIMCO in accordance with procedures established by the Trust's Board of Trustees and in accordance with the 1940 Act (or, as permitted by applicable regulation, enter into certain offsetting positions) to cover its obligations under the proposed derivative instruments. The Exchange represents that these procedures have been adopted consistent with Section 18 of the 1940 Act and related Commission guidance. In addition, with respect to the proposed investments in derivative instruments, the Exchange states that appropriate risk disclosures will be provided in the Fund's offering documents, including leveraging risk. The Exchange further represents that the Fund's investments, including the proposed investments in derivative instruments, are subject to all of the restrictions under the 1940 Act, including restrictions with respect to illiquid securities.
Further, the Commission notes that the Fund's disclosure of derivative positions in the Disclosed Portfolio will include information that market participants can use to value these positions intraday. This information will include, as applicable to the type of holding: Ticker symbol, CUSIP number or other identifier, if any; a description of the holding (including the type of holding, such as the type of swap); the identity of the security, commodity, index or other asset or instrument underlying the holding, if any; for options, the option strike price; quantity held (as measured by, for example, par value, notional value or number of shares, contracts or units); maturity date, if any; coupon rate, if any; effective date, if any; market value of the holding; and the percentage weighting of the holding in the Fund's portfolio.
The Exchange states that there will be minimal, if any, impact to the arbitrage mechanism as a result of the use of derivatives. Market makers and participants should be able to value derivatives as long as the positions are disclosed with relevant information. The Exchange notes that the price at which Shares trade will continue to be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to purchase or redeem creation Shares at their NAV, which should ensure that Shares will not trade at a material discount or premium in relation to their NAV. In addition, the Exchange notes that there will not be any significant impacts to the settlement or operational aspects of the Fund's arbitrage mechanism due to the use of derivatives.
In support of this proposal, the Exchange has made additional representations, including:
(1) The Adviser has managed and will continue to manage the Fund in the manner described in the Prior Release.
(2) There is no change to the Fund's investment objective.
(3) The Fund will continue to comply with all initial and continued listing requirements under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600.
(4) FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, will communicate as needed regarding trading in the Shares, exchange traded options, futures, and options on futures with other markets or other entities that are members of the ISG, and FINRA may obtain trading information regarding trading in the Shares, exchange traded options, futures, and options on futures from such markets or entities. In addition, the Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in the Start Printed Page 44229Shares, exchange traded options, futures, and options on futures from markets or other entities that are members of ISG or with which the Exchange has in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. In addition, FINRA, on behalf of the Exchange, is able to access, as needed, trade information for certain fixed income securities held by the Fund reported to FINRA's TRACE.
(5) The Fund will comply with the representations as prescribed in the No-Action Letter.
(6) Except for the proposed changes, all other facts presented and representations made in the Prior Release remain unchanged.
This approval order is based on the Exchange's representations and description of the Fund, including those set forth above and in the Notice. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 2, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act [23] and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.
IV. Conclusion
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,[24] that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSEArca-2013-122) as modified by Amendment No. 2 thereto be, and it hereby is, approved.

President Trump's Shameful Mugging of Broadcom Has Nothing To Do With 'National Security'

A strange thing happened during World War I. As the western world set about trying to commit suicide in its pursuit of a needless war, U.S. exports to Scandinavian countries surged.
Why the sudden demand for U.S. products from that part of the world? The answer is that there wasn’t. What happened is that the U.S. had slapped a trade embargo on Germany. No big deal. Germans continued to import and consume U.S. goods and services; albeit from countries the U.S. hadn’t embargoed.
The simple truth is that if you’re producing, you’re importing. And to import, which is the sole purpose of production, you’re exporting. The trade could be with a producer on the other side of town, or on the other side of the world. This trade occurs among the productive, and without regard to wholly symbolic “embargoes.”
Which brings us to Donald Trump’s wholly inexcusable decision on Monday to block Broadcom’s attempted acquisition of Qualcomm. The president excused the inexcusable with the always empty claim that our “national security” was put at risk by the combination. Supposedly Singapore-domiciled Broadcom would favor Chinese telecom giant Huawei over U.S. players, and the latter would empower Huawei to somehow set the 5G wireless standard. Ok, but so what?
And while it dumbs down what is a ridiculous conversation to even mention this, the simple truth is that Broadcom is not a Singaporean company, nor is it Chinese. It’s largely based in San Jose, CA. Its executive team is 100% comprised of U.S. citizens. Eight out of ten board members are U.S. citizens, not to mention that Broadcom employs 8,600 Americans in over twenty-five U.S. states.
Broadcom is Singapore based for a good, pro-shareholder reason. It’s got a better tax environment. Conservatives used to properly cheer when corporations protected shareholder wealth from taxation (Broadcom’s top twenty shareholders are all American), but having bought Trump’s ludicrous nationalism hook, line and sinker, they now cheer on tax bills that force globalized U.S. companies to “repatriate” profits to the U.S so that they can be taxed. Who cares that those profits were already in the U.S. to the extent that there were worthy growth initiatives? Certainly not conservatives. They lust for rising tax revenues so long as one of their own is in the White House.
Sadly, Broadcom will redomicile stateside in the next month, and its reward will be hundreds of millions worth of taxes handed over to the federal government. The odd thing is that absent Broadcom’s proper focus on shielding shareholder wealth from the taxman, Republicans and conservatives likely wouldn’t have lost their minds over its attempted purchase of San Diego-based Qualcomm. Alas, we’ll never know.
Back to the land of reason, Broadcom wasn’t offering $117 billion for Qualcomm with an eye on controlling the 5G wireless standards to American detriment. Only in novels, movies and in the minds of the political class do businesses spend $100 billion+ in order to give the middle finger to the world’s largest market. Businesses around the world compete feverishly every day in order to gain market share in the U.S., so the idea that Broadcom would purchase Qualcomm with designs on weakening the U.S. is too silly for words.
After that, every single product in the world is the result of global cooperation. Absent the cooperation, the world would be a much poorer place. Not explained by the opponents of Broadcom’s intrepid attempt to acquire Qualcomm is why 5G technology is somehow unique such that “American” companies must be the standard setters. Forget that Broadcom is an American company by any reasonable estimation, and imagine if it were based in Beijing. What difference would it make? The Chinese are increasingly relevant economically precisely because they’ve persistently met the needs of the American consumer. Anyone who doubts the previous assertion need only walk into a Walmart on any given day. It’s useful to repeat over and over that if China didn’t exist, we would have to invent it.
As for “national security” concerns, interesting there is that the hysterics who called for blocking the deal could never articulate why. It’s hard to make reasonable what isn’t. Why would “China” or “Singapore” buy a U.S.-based company with an eye on weakening or warring with the U.S.? What could be gained? The latter speaks to the genius of trade; the very trade that Trump is skeptical about. Trade makes the very notion of war too impoverishing to contemplate. Applied to China vis-à-vis the U.S., why would it invade a country that is greatly enriching it through trade? Such a move would be the living definition of self-defeating.
But assuming war with the U.S. is the ultimate goal for the Chinese, the blocking of corporate combinations with national security in mind still makes no sense. That is so given the basic truth that there’s no accounting for the final destination of any good. So long as a country is producing, it’s importing. Going back to the example that began this piece, the U.S.’s embargo of Germany in no way kept the Germans from acquiring U.S. products. Trade between the U.S. and China would be no different. All war would do is needlessly weaken both countries through reductions in trade. Never forget that trade enriches. By its very name.
Reducing all of this to the absurd, readers might imagine a scenario in which the U.S. were totally bereft of steel. According to Trump, “IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!” More realistically, the U.S. could have nothing in the way of “American” steel, it could be 100% embargoed by every steel producing nation in the world, but its military and its businesses would have steel in abundance, and as though it had been milled right inside Pittsburgh. We would simply buy it from those whom the steel-producing countries sold it to, all at the market price. To produce is to once again import. Always. Steel isn’t unique. Neither is 5G technology that may or may not be the future standard.
Trump’s actions vis-à-vis Broadcom are shameful, and they speak to economic illiteracy. What’s worrisome is the lack of outrage on the right. The quietude is a reminder that the right’s belief in free markets and trade is somewhat situational, and only robust insofar as the occupant of the White House is a Democrat.

HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES
GENERAL DISTRIBUTION:
Field sowthistle is of European [53,109] and western Asian [109] origin and was probably introduced into North America as a seed contaminant [75]. Sonchus arvensis spp. arvensis was first reported in 1814 in Pennsylvania [109]. The earliest collection of S. a. ssp. glabrescens in North America was from Maine in 1894. Additional collections were reported from Massachusetts and Ohio as early as 1902 [37].
Field sowthistle is reported throughout most of the United States, with the exception of Hawaii, Arizona, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. It occurs throughout Canada. Sonchus arvensis spp. arvensis has the same distribution as field sowthistle, but it is not recorded in Nebraska, Kansas, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, or Alaska. Sonchus arvensis spp. uliginosus occurs across the northern portion of North America, from Alaska south to Oregon and Utah, and east to Virginia and North Carolina; but it is not reported in New Hampshire, Kentucky, British Columbia or the far northern territories of Canada [65].
No specific mention of field sowthistle in Mexico occurs in the literature. Since it occurs in Texas and New Mexico, it is reasonable to assume it may also occur in northern Mexico.
Plants database provides a state distribution map of field sowthistle and its infrataxa.
The following lists include North American ecosystems, habitat types, and forest and range cover types in which field sowthistle may occur. Field sowthistle grows well in wet and even saturated soils. Consequently, field sowthistle may occur in riparian areas or wetlands within these habitats. Additionally, field sowthistle often occurs in cultivated areas, especially small grain and row crops, so it may occur in cultivated areas within these communities, with the potential to spread into adjacent, undisturbed areas.
These lists are not necessarily inclusive or exhaustive. More information is needed to determine particular ecosystems and plant communities where field sowthistle is likely to occur in natural areas.

HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES:
Field sowthistle is found in a wide range of habitats. It occurs in cultivated fields of both small grains and row crops, in disturbed areas, "waste grounds," meadows, sloughs, woods, lawns, and along roadsides, beaches, ditches, and river and lake shores [109,110]. Although field sowthistle is adapted to many habitats, it is mentioned most often in the literature in relation to saline habitat types.
Field sowthistle is found on disturbed sites in saline habitats in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta in association with rayless alkali aster (Symphyotrichum ciliatum), spear saltbush (Atriplex patula), curlycup gumweed (Grindelia squarrosa), summer-cypress (Kochia scoparia), Nuttall's alkaligrass (Puccinellia nuttalliana), red swampfire (Salicornia rubra), and Pursh seepweed (Suaeda calceoliformis) [16].
Major species associated with S. a. ssp. uliginosus in halophytic or semihalophytic communities in Saskatchewan near saline depressions include western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), rosy pussytoes (Antennaria microphylla), manyflowered aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides var. pansum), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), wild licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidota), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), mat muhly (Muhlenbergia richardsonis), and gray goldenrod (Solidago nemoralis) [33].
Redmann [98] described plant communities along a soil salinity-moisture gradient of an eastern North Dakota prairie. Field sowthistle was present in every plant community except the muhly (Muhlenbergia spp.) and bluestem (Andropogon spp.) types. In a prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) community, field sowthistle commonly occurs with foxtail barley, slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus), scratchgrass (M. asperifolia), mat muhly, bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), northern bog aster (Symphyotrichum boreale), and marsh hedgenettle (Stachys palustris). In a bluegrass (Poa spp.) community type, field sowthistle occurs at lower elevations with foxtail barley, scratchgrass, wild licorice, and Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani). Sonchus arvensis ssp. uliginosus is found in a "salt flat" area, or saltgrass community type, with saltgrass, serpentine aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides), curlycup gumweed, alkali cordgrass (Spartina gracilis), foxtail barley, slender wheatgrass, scratchgrass, and plains bluegrass (Poa arida). It is also found in the foxtail barley community type where it occurs with plains bluegrass, scratchgrass, curlycup gumweed, serpentine aster, curly dock (Rumex crispus), prairie wedgescale (Sphenopholis obtusata), and Cuman ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) [98].

GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS:
The following description of field sowthistle provides characteristics that may be relevant to fire ecology, and is not meant for identification. Keys for identification are available in these sources: [26,34,42,45].
Field sowthistle is a perennial herb [53,74] that reproduces by seeds, by vertical, thickened roots, and by cylindrical, horizontal, spreading roots [110]. Vertical roots can penetrate 5 to10 feet (1.5-3 m) deep. Horizontal roots, frequently 2.5 to 5 mm in diameter (rarely exceeding 10 mm), are found 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) below the soil surface [10]. These horizontal roots can reach 3 to 6 feet (0.9-1.8 m) in length in a single growing season [110]. Fruits are achenes [15,90] with a pappus that generally stays attached to the achene [92].
Stems are erect, 0.1 to 0.4 inches (3-10 mm) in diameter, and most commonly 24 to 59 inches (60-150 cm) tall; although they range from 12 to 71 inches (30-180 cm) tall. Stems are hollow and branched, varying from 2 to many per plant. Leaves are crowded on the lower stems and sparse on the upper stems. The entire plant is filled with milky latex [74].
RAUNKIAER [97] LIFE FORM:
Hemicryptophyte
REGENERATION PROCESSES:
Field sowthistle can reproduce by seed and vegetatively [10,30,110].
Breeding system: Field sowthistle flowers are perfect [31] and generally self-incompatible [31,110].
Pollination: Field sowthistle is pollinated by insects including honeybees and other bees, hover flies, and blister beetles [31,110].
Seed production: Field sowthistle can produce large numbers of seeds [31,53,110,112]. Seeds produced by self pollination are generally nonviable and smaller than those produced by cross-pollination [31,110].
Heads contain many fertile flowers but the number of achenes produced varies widely among heads, plants, and locality. Variability likely results from several factors, including environmental conditions and availability of pollinators [110].
Field sowthistle can typically produce an average of 30 achenes per head and up to 50,000/yd2 [110]. In North Dakota, 1 main stalk, with "relatively little competition", produced 62 heads and 9,750 well-developed achenes. The author collected seeds from the plant for a 30-day period [112]. In South Dakota, artificially cross-pollinated heads from greenhouse- and field-grown plants produced about 50 achenes per head, but number of achenes per head in natural populations varied from about 20 to 40 or from 60 to 80, depending upon the year [31].
Seed dispersal: Seeds of field sowthistle are mostly wind dispersed [28,53,110], but other dispersal agents may play a minor role. The pappus, attached to the seed, aids in wind dispersal [92]. Hume and Archibold [63] placed seed traps at varying distances from a "weedy" field in Saskatchewan. Results show wind-blown seeds of field sowthistle can disperse at least 110 yards (100 m). They do not report wind speed.
Sheldon and Burrows [105] conducted experiments to determine maximum dispersal distance of field sowthistle seeds at differing wind speeds. They used field sowthistle plants with a mean height of 3 feet (90 cm). They observed a maximum dispersal distance of 11 yards (10 m).
Wind speed (km/hour) 5.47 10.94 16.41
Dispersal distance (m) 3.34 6.67 10.00
In addition to wind dispersal, seeds of field sowthistle may be dispersed by birds and other animals. Martin and others (as reported in [133], a literature review) state field sowthistle is a minor element in the diet of some North American birds, and some seeds may germinate after ingestion and excretion by birds and animals. Hooked cells at the tips of pappus hairs allow the pappus to cling to clothes and animal hairs and aid in seed dispersal [110,133].
Seed banking: While viable field sowthistle seeds have been found in the seed banks of marshes and wetlands [60,88], longevity of seeds in the soil seed bank under field conditions of these communities is unknown. A study of field sowthistle seed dormancy suggests that some seed may remain viable for 3 or more years in cultivated soils [23].
Seed banking studies in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba, suggest that viable field sowthistle seeds occur in marsh habitats. Sowthistles (Sonchus spp.) were dominant in the drier upland areas, so seed was likely dispersed throughout the marsh. Field sowthistle seedlings emerged from soil samples taken from the marsh and exposed to "drawdown" conditions (soil surface kept moist), but not from samples exposed to "submersed" conditions (continuously flooded to a depth of 2 to 3 cm above the soil surface) [88].
In an experiment designed to test seedling emergence from boreal wetland soils under changing climatic conditions, field sowthistle seedlings emerged from the soil seed bank in willow (Salix spp.) savanna and bluejoint reedgrass vegetation zones of a mid-boreal wetland in Alberta [60].
Although seeds of field sowthistle have low viability in cultivated fields, some can remain dormant but viable for more than 3 years in cultivated soil. Chepil [23] conducted 3 separate seed dormancy tests for "weed" species in cultivated soil in Saskatchewan. In the 1st experiment an indefinite number of field sowthistle seeds was planted in 3 soil types on 18 September, 1937. Introduction of seeds from other sources was prevented. No seeds were planted greater than 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep. Number of viable seeds remaining in the soil after 3 years was determined by repeated germination tests in the laboratory until no more germination occurred. Results are shown in the table below [23]:
Percentage of field sowthistle seeds germinated each year after planting in 3 soil types in 1937 [23]
Soil texture 1938 1939 1940 Viable seeds remaining
Clay 43.3 16.2 2.7 37.8
Loam 66.7 13.3 0 20.0
Sandy loam 86.7 0 3.3 10.0
In the 2nd experiment, 50 field sowthistle seeds were planted no deeper than 3 inches (7.6 cm) on 14 October, 1938, in 3 soil types. Again, number of viable seeds remaining in the soil after 6 years was determined by repeated germination tests in the laboratory until no more germination occurred. Values given are number of viable seeds [23].
Soil texture 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 Viable seeds remaining
Clay 33 0 4 0 0 0 0
Loam 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Sandy loam 2 3 0 0 0 0 1
The 3rd experiment utilized 1,000 field sowthistle seeds planted no deeper than 3 inches (7.6 cm). Seeds were planted between 1 and 5 November, 1940, in 3 soil types and only seeds germinated in the field were counted. Numbers are actual seeds germinating, not percentages [23].
Soil texture 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945
Clay 18 0 2 5 0
Loam 16 0 0 0 0
Sandy loam 12 0 0 1 0
Clay appears to be most conducive to long-term viability of field sowthistle seeds [23] (See Site Characteristics).
Germination: Germination of field sowthistle seeds increases with both increasing soil temperature and time since flowering. Field sowthistle seed in the field begins to germinate when the soil has "warmed" [74].
Seeds may be capable of germination about 5 days after pollination [74]; however, germination rates increased from low to none 4 days after flowering to a maximum 7 to 9 days after flowering [31,66,110]. In field germination experiments in South Dakota, Derscheid and Schultz [31] noted that percentage of viable seeds produced by field sowthistle ranged from 10% 6 days after blooming to 89% 9 days after blooming. If field sowthistle plants are pulled or cut and placed in a pile it is possible for viable seeds to be produced if flowers are present when the plants are cut [110].
In laboratory germination tests, field sowthistle seed viability is "relatively" high. Kinch and Termunde [66] achieved 95% germination in the laboratory using "well-matured" seed.
Orientation of field sowthistle seeds in the soil profile is important to germination, and light may stimulate germination. Bosy and Aarssen [15] conducted seed germination tests on field sowthistle using agar as a germinating medium. Agar was used to eliminate any environmental differences at a given depth and enabled the authors to maintain seed orientation. They found surface-lying seeds of field sowthistle displayed higher germination than buried seeds [15]. Germination was 50% for seeds germinated in soil and 80% for seeds germinated on moist filter paper, and germination was higher in diffuse laboratory light than in complete darkness [90]. When seeds were buried, seeds oriented with the radicle horizontal had significantly greater (P<0.05) germination than seeds with the radicle oriented either upward or downward.
Studies indicate temperatures from 77 to 86 °F (25-30 °C) are optimal for germination. Seeds germinate poorly (<5%) below 68 °F (20 °C) and above 95 °F (35 °C), but alternating temperatures were more favorable for germination than constant temperatures if temperatures above 77 °F (25 °C) are included in the cycle [52]. Stevens [110] reports seeds exposed to 90 °F (32 °C) for a "few hours daily" germinate "freely" in 4 to 7 days.
Field sowthistle seed germination in wetlands could be limited by saturated soils. For example, Hogenbirk and Wein [60] germinated seeds of field sowthistle from combined soil and litter samples from a mid-boreal wetland in Alberta. No field sowthistle seeds germinated in samples taken from a sedge (Carex spp.) marsh. Field sowthistle seeds stored in fresh water were 100% decomposed after 3 months storage [18].
Seedling establishment/growth: Field sowthistle seedlings survive best in areas with protective plant cover or litter and high moisture compared with open cultivated soil [110]. Accordingly, seedlings are often only found along pond, ditch, or field margins, or in lawns, meadows, or uncultivated fields [92]. In a series of field germination experiments with field sowthistle seeds, Stevens [110] had little success growing seedlings in cultivated field plots. Laboratory germination tests with the same lot of seeds showed 56% germination.
Most field sowthistle seedlings do not emerge until mid- to late May in Saskatchewan and the Great Plains of the United States [74]. Seedlings grow slowly for about the first 2 weeks until leaves are about 1.2 inches (3 cm) long [110]. They develop rapidly after that, and reproductive ability of spreading roots is established quickly [52,110]. Stevens [110] noted 10 seedlings on 17 May, 1923. The 10 seedlings grew slowly until 1 June when the largest leaves were 1.2 inches (3 cm) long. After that, they developed "rapidly" and on 5 July, a horizontal root 28 inches long (71 cm) was removed from the largest plant [110].
Most seedlings do not flower the first year, but flowering in late summer is possible from some first-year seedlings in favorable environments [52,110].
Asexual regeneration: Field sowthistle reproduces vegetatively from buds on horizontal and vertical roots and on basal portions of aerial stems located just under the soil surface. Thickened roots develop as a result of secondary growth of original fibrous roots [51] and begin to show reproductive capacity when thickened to 1 to 1.5 mm [50]. This occurs on vertical primary roots when seedlings reach the 4-leaf stage and on horizontal roots when seedlings have 6 to 7 photosynthetic leaves. One-month-old seedlings can have 7 to 8 leaves with horizontal roots from 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) long and 1.5 mm thick. Horizontal roots from 24 to 39 inches (60-100 cm) and vertical roots penetrating 20 inches (50 cm) can develop from seedlings within 4 months after emergence. Vertical roots can produce vegetative buds as deep as 20 inches (50 cm) below the soil surface, and new aerial growth has been observed from buds as deep as 16 inches (40 cm) below the soil surface [110]. New shoots can develop from buds that overwinter on both vertical and horizontal "spreading" roots, and/or on basal portions of aerial stems [51,89]. In North Dakota, the rate of vegetative spread of field sowthistle clones varied from 1.6 to 9 feet (0.5-2.8 m) per year, depending on the clone (personal observation in [74]).
Harris and Shorthouse [53] describe the horizontal roots of field sowthistle as "easily broken", and new plants can grow from root fragments and flower within 1 year [50,110]. Of field sowthistle root fragments planted on 3 May in a field experiment in North Dakota, approximately 50% of 0.25-inch-long pieces, 75% of 0.5-inch-long pieces, and 85% of 1-inch-long pieces produced plants within 20 to 34 days. Where well developed buds were present on root fragments, plants emerged quickly and were strong; if buds were not present, new plants grew more slowly from the cut surface and were weak. Plants grown from these root fragments reached a height of 3 feet (1 m) and flowered abundantly between 27 July and 6 August. On 29 June the largest of these plants had 2 horizontal roots 42 to 45 inches long (107-114 cm). The 45-inch root had 42 buds and sprouts in various stages of development. By the end of the growing season, horizontal roots from these plants reached about 6 feet (1.8 m) in length [110].
SITE CHARACTERISTICS:
Field sowthistle is adapted to moist, sunny locations in temperate regions but is absent from tropical areas [74]. Within temperate regions, field sowthistle has a broad tolerance to variable environments and adapts well to wet sites, even with little soil disturbance. In Canada, field sowthistle occurs in areas that receive average annual precipitation of 12 to 120 inches (300-3,000 mm) [133]. In a greenhouse study, growth of field sowthistle plants was positively correlated with increasing soil water, with greatest growth occurring at complete saturation [132]. However, field sowthistle also establishes on dry sites [98]. Neither the climatic conditions required for successful establishment nor conditions, if any, favoring S. a. ssp. arvensis over S. a. ssp. uliginosus have been established [74].
Field sowthistle is adapted to many soil types but appears to prefer fine-textured soils and does not thrive on dry, coarse-textured sand. Field sowthistle seems to prefer slightly alkaline or neutral soils and does not thrive in acid soils, salt marshes, or highly alkaline areas [110]. However, Zollinger and Kells [132] determined soil pH had little effect on leaf production, plant height, or number of capitula produced.
Field sowthistle is present in a variety of community types from those occurring on wet, very strongly saline surface soil and strongly saline subsoil to nonsaline and dry soils [98]. Dodd and Coupland [33] describe field sowthistle as occurring in halophytic or semihalophytic communities in Saskatchewan.
SUCCESSIONAL STATUS:
Field sowthistle is an early-successional plant. Komarova [67] and Zollinger and Parker [133] describe field sowthistle as a pioneer species. In a study of succession after fire in "highland hardwoods" in Wisconsin, it appeared in 6 out of 10 plots in the herbaceous stage of succession [44]. Although infrequent, field sowthistle is part of the early successional community on wetlands in the blast zone after the Mount St. Helen's eruption [121].
Field sowthistle is most competitive under abundant precipitation and moderate climates [133].
SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT:
Shoots and new roots in established stands begin to develop when the soil starts to warm [51,110]. Small leaves begin to appear from shallow roots about 1 week from initial growth [110], and adventitious root development begins 3 to 4 weeks later. Initial thickening of new roots begins when plants have 5 to 7 leaves [50,52]. Secondary thickening proceeds quickly, and spreading roots 4 mm thick and over 79 inches (200 cm) long can be detected by 3 months after initial growth [110]. Thickening of new roots ceases by mid-summer. New shoots develop from roots 2-3 mm in diameter until late summer [74].
Flowering stems begin to develop when plants have 12 to 15 leaves [50,110]. Flowering begins about 1 July in the northern United States and continues until plants are frosted, although most flowering is complete by late summer [110]. Time required from flowering to fruit maturation is about 10 days [74].

POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY
FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS:
Fire adaptations: As of this writing (2004), no information is available specifically addressing fire adaptations in field sowthistle; however, inferences regarding its ability to establish, persist, and spread after fire are possible, based on its regeneration strategies and data from a small number of fire studies in which field sowthistle occurred.
Field sowthistle seeds are dispersed by wind (see Seed dispersal), and seedlings may establish on burned areas from offsite seed sources when mature plants occur in the vicinity of the burn. Seedlings established on burned sites in red pine forest in Minnesota [3] and on the Delta Marsh in Manitoba [120], while no field sowthistle plants occurred on unburned control plots in either study. Probability of postfire establishment from offsite seed may be related to season of burning (see Plant Response to Fire). Information on seed banking for field sowthistle suggests that it is possible for seedlings to establish from the soil seed bank after fire, although this has not been documented in the available literature.
Field sowthistle plants are likely to survive and persist on burned areas, even after high-severity fire, and the limited available data on postfire response of field sowthistle indicate little difference in abundance between burned and unburned sites [59,86] (see Plant response to fire). Field sowthistle shoots develop from numerous underground buds on both vertical and horizontal roots, and on basal portions of aerial stems [51,89] (see Asexual regeneration). Vertical roots can be 5 to 10 feet (1.5-3 m) deep [10] with the potential to produce shoots from buds as deep as 16 inches (40 cm) below the soil surface [110]. These buds would not be affected by fire. Horizontal roots of field sowthistle occur 2 to 4 inches (5-10 cm) below the surface [10] and would probably also be protected from all but the most severe fires.
Fire regimes: As of this writing (2004), no information regarding fire regimes in which field sowthistle evolved was found in the available literature; nor was information available regarding impacts of field sowthistle invasion on fuel characteristics or fire regimes in native North American plant communities. The following table provides fire return intervals for plant communities and ecosystems where field sowthistle may occur in North America. Field sowthistle may also occur within riparian or wetland areas included in these ecosystems.

DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT:
As of this writing (2004), no accounts in the literature discuss or describe immediate effects of fire on field sowthistle plants or seeds. It is reasonable to assume that field sowthistle plants are top-killed by fire and that some underground regenerating organs survive even high-severity fire (see Fire adaptations).
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT:
No additional information is available on this topic.
PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE:
Field sowthistle can establish on burned sites from wind-dispersed seed, as suggested by results of studies in red pine (Pinus resinosa) forest in Minnesota [3] and on the Delta Marsh in Manitoba [120]. Field sowthistle seedlings may be more likely to establish on burned sites after summer fires, when field sowthistle plants are likely to be dispersing seed, than following fall or spring fires [120].
Established field sowthistle plants are likely to persist after fire on burned sites, though it is unclear whether its overall abundance will increase or decrease in the postfire environment. Postfire data from studies in Alberta, Canada [59] and North Dakota [86] shows little difference between burned and unburned sites, and no detectable postfire trend in field sowthistle abundance 1 to 2 years after fire.
Flowering of field sowthistle may increase after fire. Postfire flowering response may be related to postfire moisture availability [91].
DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:
Field sowthistle may establish on burned sites from wind-dispersed seed. Soil samples were taken from burned and unburned areas of a 270-year-old red pine forest in Minnesota 3 years after wildfire. No field sowthistle germinants emerged from soil taken from unburned areas, while the equivalent of 109,000 field sowthistle seedlings per hectare emerged from soil taken from burned areas. No field sowthistle plants occurred in either burned or unburned plots, and no field sowthistle seeds were found in unburned soil samples. The author concluded that field sowthistle seedlings probably developed from seeds blown into the burned areas after the fire [3].
Probability of postfire establishment from offsite seed sources may be related to season of burning. Thompson and Shay [120] conducted 3 prescribed burn treatments in 3 different seasons on the Delta Marsh in Manitoba. Field sowthistle was absent from unburned plots, but seedlings established on both summer and fall burned plots, with greatest establishment 1 month following summer burns. These seedlings persisted into the following year, resulting in increased nonseedling shoot density and biomass on summer burned plots:

Seedling density (no./m² 0 15.5 (11.5) 0 0.4 (0.4) 0
Nonseedling shoot density (no./m² 0 --- 8 (1.7) 0 0
Biomass (g/m² 0 --- 28.2 (16.9) 0.1 (0.2) 0
Field sowthistle has a long flowering period that begins in early July and continues until plants are frosted, with peak flowering in mid to late summer [110]. Summer burns on the Delta Marsh were conducted at the time of year when the most mature sowthistle seed was likely being dispersed, while timing of fall burns corresponded to a time of year when fewer seeds were likely to be available, and spring burns occurred when no field sowthistle seed would likely be available [120]. Although there is evidence that field sowthistle seeds occur in the soil seed bank in the Delta Marsh [88] (see seed banking), it is more likely that field sowthistle seedlings detected in this study [120] established from wind-dispersed seed, given the correspondence of burn season, field sowthistle phenology, and seedling establishment.
While field sowthistle is likely to persist after fire, data are insufficient for detecting trends in its postfire abundance. Simulated "light" and "deep" burns using a propane torch in both bluejoint reedgrass and willow savanna habitats in northern Alberta found little difference in field sowthistle cover 2 growing seasons after summer burning [59]:

Abundance of field sowthistle plants was highly variable on burned and unburned prairie sites in a study to evaluate the effects of prescribed burning on grassland species desired for wildlife habitat on the Tewaukon National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern North Dakota. Cover of field sowthistle was mostly the same on burned and unburned sites, but in some years was either significantly higher on or significantly lower on burned versus control plots. Data show both great variation in percent canopy cover and no clear trend of increase or decrease on burned versus control plots, 1 month or 26 months after fires in May or June [86].
In northwestern Minnesota, flowering of field sowthistle increased on some sites after prescribed fire was used as part of a prairie restoration project. Burns were conducted in spring 1973, and data on flowering response were collected during the growing season of the same year. Results were based on comparison of burned and unburned transects. Field sowthistle was recorded on 3 site types in the study area: a wet-mesic site in "badly" disturbed prairie, a wet swale site in undisturbed prairie, and a gently sloping to nearly level mesic site in undisturbed prairie. Flowering increased after prescribed fire, relative to controls, on both disturbed and undisturbed wet prairie sites, but was not different from controls in the mesic prairie site [91].
FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
Postfire colonization potential: Field sowthistle may establish on burned sites after fire [3,120], especially when burning is conducted during the flowering period [120]. Managers should be alert to this possibility when field sowthistle occurs in the vicinity of the burn area. Additionally, flowering of field sowthistle may be stimulated by prescribed burning [91], resulting in increased seed production and further increasing the likelihood of postfire establishment.
Control of field sowthistle using prescribed fire: While no research is available examining the potential for using prescribed fire to control field sowthistle, evidence from other fire studies [59,86] suggest that it is likely to persist after fire and may increase in abundance on some sites. Given the abundance of underground buds on both vertical and horizontal roots, and on basal portions of aerial stems [51,89], it is unlikely that prescribed fire would be severe enough to substantially damage established field sowthistle plants.
If field sowthistle plants are pulled or cut and placed in a pile it is possible for viable seeds to be produced if flowers are present when the plants are cut. These plants could be burned to reduce the possibility of viable seeds being produced [110].

IMPACTS AND CONTROL
IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE:
Field sowthistle is "good" as a livestock feed [111,129]. Sheep and cattle will eat new growth and sometimes roots [133], and pronghorns were observed utilizing field sowthistle in central Montana during the fall [24].
Field sowthistle is considered "excellent" forage for rabbits [118] and Martin and others (as reported in [133], a literature review) state field sowthistle is a minor element in the diet of some North American birds.
Field sowthistle is listed as a nonnative plant occurring in critical habitat of the threatened desert tortoise in the Mojave and Colorado deserts. It is of concern because it competes with native plants vital to the tortoises' survival [17].
Palatability/nutritional value: Although field sowthistle compares favorably with alfalfa (Medicago sativa) for nutritional value, it is not especially palatable to grazing animals. Dry field sowthistle is about 10% protein by weight [19,20]. Palatability of field sowthistle to lambs was lower compared to grasses and alfalfa, and infestations of field sowthistle in pastures and hayfields may decrease overall forage feeding value [76].
Field sowthistle has equal or higher in vitro digestible dry matter, micro- and macromineral content and crude protein and lower neutral detergent fiber compared to alfalfa [76]:

OTHER USES:
Roasted roots of field sowthistle have been used like chicory (Cichorium intybus) root as an additive or a replacement for coffee. The young, tender leaves can be eaten raw in salads or cooked [118].
Most of the latex of field sowthistle is oil and may be a potential crop for oil or hydrocarbon production [19,20]. Field sowthistle is a good source of pentacyclic triterpenes, which may become important in the pharmaceutical industry [61].
IMPACTS AND CONTROL:
Impacts: Information concerning the impacts of field sowthistle on natural communities is absent from the literature. Research is needed to determine and document what effects field sowthistle may have on wildlands.
Control: Field sowthistle is relatively resistant to many common broadleaf herbicides compared to most annual broadleaf weeds. Consequently, the best systems for control often include a combination of cultural and chemical treatments designed to reduce competition from field sowthistle, prevent seed production, and reduce the reproductive capacity of its roots (Fryer and Makepeace, 1982, as reported in a literature review [74]).
As of this writing (2004) there is no information available on control of field sowthistle in natural areas.
Prevention: The most efficient and effective method of managing invasive species is to prevent their invasion and spread [107]. Since field sowthistle seed is so easily disseminated by wind, scouting and detection are keys to preventing plant establishment [133]. It is easier to prevent initial colonization by field sowthistle than to eliminate established populations. Seedlings are easily controlled through mechanical and chemical methods. Planting weed-free crop seed and controlling field sowthistle on field borders can prevent initial infestations in wildlands adjacent to agricultural settings [133] (See Seedling establishment/growth).
Integrated management: Components of any integrated weed management program are sustained effort, constant evaluation, and the adoption of improved strategies [106]. Factors to be addressed before a management decision is made include inventory and assessment to identify the target weed(s) and determine the size of the infestation(s); assessment of nontarget vegetation, soil types, climatic conditions, and important water resources. An evaluation of the benefits and limitations of each control method also needs to be accomplished [84].
Combinations of tillage plus cultural practices or herbicides applied regularly have controlled field sowthistle in agricultural settings [30]. No information is available on integrated control measures for field sowthistle in wildlands.
Timing of control measures may increase the effectiveness of integrated management techniques. Schimming and Messersmith [102] conducted artificial freezing experiments with field sowthistle. They determined a temperature of 1 oF (-17 oC) reduced survival of field sowthistle roots by 50% and a temperature of 4 oF (-15 oC) reduced total dry weight of emerging field sowthistle shoots by 50%. The authors speculate conditions that tend to minimize hardening, such as lack of photosynthetic material in fall after tillage or chemical treatment, stimulation of fall growth after tillage, or high nitrogen levels may increase injury caused by freezing temperatures in the field.
Physical/mechanical: Tillage generally reduces field sowthistle, but its effectiveness depends on plant growth characteristics at time of tillage [10,50,52], type of tillage being utilized [30,51], and frequency of tillage [92]. Intensive tillage is usually not appropriate in wildland settings, so it is not discussed further here.
Studies of mowing as a control method for field sowthistle show mixed results. Defoliation was less effective than burial for reducing infestations of field sowthistle in a study done in Sweden in 1967 [52], suggesting mowing is not as effective as tillage for control of field sowthistle [74]. However, Stevens [110] found defoliation an efficient method to control field sowthistle. Plants grown from root cuttings planted 3 May, had their leaves removed by hoe on 23 May when the largest leaves were about 6 inches (15 cm) long. The plants had the leaves removed again on 1 June, when leaves had again grown to about 6 inches (15 cm). After the 1 June defoliation, leaf growth was less vigorous. There was "very little" regrowth of leaves after a 1 July defoliation and none after a 19 July defoliation although weather conditions were favorable for growth. No plants appeared the next spring.
Fire: See the Fire Management Considerations section of this summary.
Biological: There appears to be limited biological agents available to help control field sowthistle. A tephritid fly from Europe that transforms the seedhead of field sowthistle into a gall has been released into Canada but has not become established [53]. Cystiphora sonchi, another fly native to Europe, was released into Canada and has become established in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia [93]. Zollinger and Parker [133] report as many as 721 galls were formed on one plant of field sowthistle, but Lemna and Messersmith [74] state that no reduction in field sowthistle because of Cystiphora sonchi has been observed. A third fly, Liriomyza sonchi, has been authorized for release into Canada (Peschken and Derby 1988, reported in [74]).
Zollinger and Parker [133] provide a literature review of biological control efforts as of 1998.
Chemical: Auxin-type herbicides are the primary chemicals used to control field sowthistle. Field sowthistle is "moderately susceptible" to auxins such as 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, and MCPA in the seedling stage, and established stands are "moderately resistant" (Fryer and Makepeace, 1982, as reported in a literature review [74]). Growth of aerial portions can be retarded by auxin-type herbicides, and flowering can be completely suppressed if the plant is treated when growth is vigorous (Fryer and Makepeace 1982 as reported in a literature review [74]), and [77]. A more detailed discussion of chemical control of field sowthistle is provided by Lemna and Messersmith [74] and by Zollinger and Parker [133].
Cultural: Patches of field sowthistle were cut for hay or were pastured as an early control measure [111,129]. An alfalfa or alfalfa-grass mixture, regularly cut for hay, can eliminate 90% of field sowthistle in 3 years (Martin and others 1961 in [74]).
"Intensive" grazing by domestic sheep or cattle weakens field sowthistle when the animals eat new growth and sometimes roots [133]. Grazing also enhances other control practices. However, field sowthistle is classified as an "increaser" under heavy grazing because it increases as more palatable plants are preferentially grazed [70].

Indonesia’s brutal history brought to global attention
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, authors have tried to broadcast an alternative version the country’s history

Thank you for your help!
In 1999, as Indonesians were still celebrating the end of 31 years of dictatorial rule by Suharto, their second president, an unemployed philosophy graduate started writing a sprawling novel that blended his fascination for martial arts and horror stories with an acerbic take on his country’s twisted history.
Eka Kurniawan finished Beauty is a Wound three years later, in 2002. Weaving together graphic violence and rape with vicious takedowns of officials, religious figures and even the idea of Indonesia itself, it may have seemed designed to flop. This was, after all, a country with a limited literary culture and many lingering political sensitivities.
Sure enough, after being picked up by a tiny local publisher and reprinted briefly by a bigger rival, the book disappeared. Undeterred, Kurniawan wrote another, Man Tiger, two years later. His second novel was barely more successful. “Those two novels gave me almost no money, so I started to work as a scriptwriter and editor for a television production house,” says Kurniawan.
Yet somehow, over a decade later, he has found himself at the forefront of a revival of international interest in Indonesian writing that has resulted in global publishing deals, glowing reviews and Man Tiger’s longlist nomination for the 2016 Man Booker International Prize.
Besides Kurniawan and other Indonesian authors, such as Leila Chudori and Laksmi Pamuntjak, who have emerged on the world literary stage, a strange cast of characters has helped to bring about this awakening. They include a US documentary-maker dedicated to exposing the truth about Indonesia’s 1965 mass killings, a grizzled expatriate translator in Jakarta and executives of the Frankfurt Book Fair, the world’s largest literary trade show.
It is a suitably unlikely story for a country dubbed the “improbable nation” by US journalist and scientist Elizabeth Pisani in Indonesia Etc., published last year, which asks why a country so large and diverse still attracts so little attention from the rest of the world.
Not since Pramoedya Ananta Toer, the former political prisoner who wrote in the second half of the 20th century about Indonesia’s struggle for independence from Dutch colonial rule, have writers from Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation, attracted such interest.
The development of a literary scene in Indonesia has been hobbled by an exploitative colonial history that left many illiterate, a long period of censorship under Suharto and a weakened education system that does not teach literature, even in today’s more open and democratic society. The new buzz around Indonesian authors has caught the few people slaving away in the nation’s small publishing industry unawares.

“I can’t believe it’s taken this long, after working in this field for 40 years and publishing close to 200 titles,” says John McGlynn, a US translator who runs the Lontar Foundation, a Jakarta-based organisation that promotes Indonesian literature — the only one in the country that is trying to do so to a global audience. “There’s a basic ignorance and lack of knowledge about Indonesia abroad, which you can blame on the Indonesian government as well as the international media. Then there’s the global publishing industry, which is usually unwilling to take a chance on introducing foreign-sounding authors.”
As he chain-smokes Indonesian clove cigarettes in his office in a small villa, McGlynn, who translated Chudori’s 2012 novel Home into English, explains that the Frankfurt Book Fair’s decision to name Indonesia as guest of honour in 2015 was the “key turning point”.
Writers have been able to change the perception of Indonesia as a country that doesn’t know what it’s doing
Claudia Kaiser
With tens of thousands of international publishers, agents and journalists in attendance, the fair is one of the few opportunities for talented non-English writers to make the connections they need in order to succeed. Following in the footsteps of writers from previous guests of honour such as Turkey and South Korea, Indonesia’s authors suddenly found the book world was listening to what they had to say. “They’ve been able to change the perception of Indonesia as a country that doesn’t know what it’s doing,” says Claudia Kaiser, the Jakarta-based vice-president for South and Southeast Asia at the Frankfurt Book Fair.
Kurniawan, Chudori and Pamuntjak all have very different backgrounds, personalities and writing styles. What stirred international interest in these authors was that they had all written about the 1965 massacres of more than 500,000 Communists, leftist sympathisers and their families and friends, which Suharto had used to take control of the nation. “It’s all about 1965,” says Kaiser.
Eka Kurniawan © Muhammad Fadli
Indonesians are still taught the Suharto-era propaganda that the mass killings were a necessary and limited pre-emptive move against an imminent Communist takeover. But since the fall of Suharto in 1998, a handful of Indonesian journalists and writers have tried to broadcast an alternative version.
Joshua Oppenheimer, an American film-maker with a love for Indonesia, thrust the painful truth in front of a global audience with his horrific, Oscar-nominated 2012 documentary The Act of Killing.

Tuesday, 26 March, 2019
In Germany, which is still struggling with its own genocidal history, readers seemed to connect with Indonesian writers’ battles to make sense of a past that refuses to retreat into history. “I couldn’t breathe at some of the events because there were so many people trying to interview me,” says Chudori, who is a senior editor at Tempo, Indonesia’s most respected weekly news magazine.
Pamuntjak, who co-founded Aksara, one of Jakarta’s best-loved bookshops, says that readers are drawn to writing framed around what conflicts do to ordinary people. “Were friendships possible between the oppressor and the oppressed, was forgiveness possible?” she asks. “These questions, which inevitably open up so many grey zones of the human psyche — doubts, ambiguities, inconsistencies, good versus evil, man versus woman, friend versus foe — are wonderful material for the novel.”
Yet despite the global attention, the debate about 1965 in Indonesia is still a limited one and the domestic publishing industry remains weak. One of the great ironies of the resurgence of Indonesian writing is that it has been facilitated by a lack of domestic interest, which has allowed authors to tackle taboos about sex, Islam and politics without censorship or a concerted backlash from hardline political or religious groups.

Sen. Udall to Keynote "Solutions Day" at Next Generation Water Summit
Green Builder® Coalition Promotes EPA's "Fix a Leak Week"
Activities
Sen. Udall to Keynote "Solutions Day" at Next Generation Water Summit
U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) will address the Next Generation Water Summit on May 1st in Santa Fe, NM. His keynote address will begin at 8:15 am at the Santa Fe Community Convention Center.
Senator Udall began serving as U.S. Senator from New Mexico in 2009, after two decades of public service as U.S. Representative and State Attorney General. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, he wrote and passed legislation to establish a national renewable electricity standard, which spurred the creation of good jobs, reinvigorated the economy, and reduced global warming emissions.
Energy has been a priority of Udall’s career in Washington, with water becoming more and more important due to population growth and changing climate patterns in the Southwest. “In New Mexico, we know that water is life – and we know that we don’t have water to waste. I’m grateful for the essential work being done across our state to encourage conservation and innovation, and Santa Fe is the perfect place to bring together stakeholders to chart a more sustainable path forward at the Next Generation Water Summit. Together, we can find solutions to secure New Mexico’s water future, as well as the rest of the West,” Senator Udall recently stated.
The Summit is being held April 29 – May 1, 2018. This unique water and water reuse event will feature builders presenting on Net Zero Water Houses and Near Net Zero Water houses. These Southwestern builders will also address both how and why reducing water consumption is the right thing to do to sustain the homebuilding industry in the Southwest. Finally, water professionals from Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah will discuss and collaborate on distinctive conservation and reuse initiatives within their states.
A limited number of attendees will also be able to register for one of two charrettes. The charrettes are a new feature at this year’s Summit, with only 80 total slots available. The professionally moderated, half-day charrettes will take place on Tuesday, May 1. White papers will be produced and distributed to all Summit attendees, not just those who participate in the charrettes. Prospective attendees will not want to delay registering for this rare opportunity. Early bird registration expires on March 22. For more information on the rest of the Summit, please visit www.NextGenerationWaterSummit.com.
Hosts of the Next Generation Water Summit include the Santa Fe Green Chamber of Commerce, Green Builder® Coalition, City of Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Area Home Builders Association, and The Alliance for Water Efficiency. Major sponsors include Vulcan, a Paul G. Allen Company; and Uponor. Santa Fe Community College is the official education sponsor, and Green Builder® Media is the national media partner.
The Next Generation Water Summit brings together the building and development community, water reuse professionals and water policymakers in a collaborative setting to share best practices and learn about innovative water conservation and water reuse techniques that can be used to comply with water conservation restrictions spreading across the southwest.
Green Builder® Coalition Promotes EPA's "Fix a Leak Week"
Drip. Drip. Drip. The average American household wastes more than 10,000 gallons each year from easy-to-fix water leaks—that’s the amount of water needed to wash 270 loads of laundry. If that doesn’t seem like a lot, consider that across the country, easy-to-fix household leaks can add up to nearly 1 trillion gallons of water lost every year.
That’s why the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is encouraging homeowners to find and fix leaks during the annual Fix a Leak Week, March 19-25, 2018. Sponsored by EPA’s WaterSense® program, "Fix a Leak Week" reminds homeowners of the easy steps they can take to help save water in their community now and for future generations.
Fixing household leaks not only saves water, but reduces water utility bills—by about 10%. Start saving today with three simple steps: Check. Twist. Replace.
1. Check
First, check your home for leaks. An easy way to start is to examine your winter water use. If it exceeds 12,000 gallons per month for a family of four, you probably have leaks. Walk around your home with eyes and ears open to find leaks, and don’t forget to check pipes and outdoor spigots. You can also detect silent toilet leaks, a common water-wasting culprit, by adding a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and waiting 10 minutes before flushing. If any color appears in the bowl during that time, your toilet has a leak. Visit www.epa.gov/watersense for do-it-yourself repair tips or contact a plumbing professional.
2. Twist
Apply pipe tape to be sure plumbing fixture connections are sealed tight and give leaking faucets and showerheads a firm twist with a wrench. If you can’t stop those drops yourself, contact your favorite plumbing professional. For additional savings, twist a WaterSense labeled aerator onto each bathroom faucet to save water without noticing a difference in flow. Faucet aerators cost a few dollars or less and can save a household more than 500 gallons each year!
3. Replace
If you just can’t nip that drip, it may be time to replace the fixture. Look for WaterSense labeled models, which use at least 20% less water and are independently certified to perform as well or better than standard plumbing fixtures. Replacing an old, inefficient showerhead with a WaterSense-labeled model will shrink your household’s water footprint by 2,700 gallons annually while still letting you shower with power, thanks to EPA’s efficiency and performance criteria. With less hot water passing through, WaterSense labeled showerheads can also save enough energy to power a television for a year.
Because we want to ensure water supplies last for future generations, the Green Builder® Coalition is showing that we’re for water by not only supporting "Fix a Leak Week", but all throughout the year. Every WERS verification starts with a whole-house pressure test to determine if there are any leaks. If a leak is detected, the WERS Verifier is instructed to notify the property owner immediately and postpone the verification until after the leak is fixed.
Want to do more? Every little bit helps. Join thousands of others who are supporting the "We’re for Water" campaign, organized by WaterSense. Visit www.epa.gov/watersense and take the "I’m for Water" pledge or visit WaterSense on Facebook to share why you’re for water and learn more water-saving tips: www.facebook.com/EPAwatersense.

Applying For Medicaid Nursing Home Help In Texas
Applying for Texas Medicaid Nursing home benefits offers critically important financial assistance to Texas seniors. Without this help elders requiring care would be exposed to unsafe living conditions at home. If you’re like most folks, the idea of going toe-to-toe with a government bureaucracy is intimidating. Frankly, you have good reason to be concerned.
Medicaid eligibility rules are complicated and the application system is anything but consumer friendly!
The application for benefits is lengthy and loaded with traps for the unwary. I’m not saying the government is “out to get you.” Not at all. The big issue is the massive, convoluted nature of Medicaid rules. Like driving on unfamiliar country roads at night in a storm, a wrong turn could put you in a place where you can’t find your wait out.
First, let’s look at what Medicaid is. Then I’ll give you some pointers on how to successfully navigate the application process.
There are several different Medicaid programs, each with a different set of qualifications. The program for nursing home assistance is managed under “Medicaid for the Elderly and People with Disabilities.” Through this program Texas teams up with the federal government to help pay the cost of nursing home care to qualified individuals.
As with most Government funded programs, the first step in applying for Medicaid eligibility requires you to meet certain income and asset guidelines. Click here to view our online Medicaid guide.
The program is “means tested.” That means the applicant (and spouse, if married) must meet exacting income and asset limits to obtain benefits. But don’t misread “exacting” to mean “impossible.”
While the guidelines are fairly strict the rules provide surprising flexibility that allow both single and married applicants to protect their home and life savings. You just need to know where to look to know how to structure your assets the right way.
When you do, the benefits can be worth the effort required.
The key when applying for Medicaid is to never file an application until you know you are eligible. Timing the application is an important part of the overall strategy. Filing too soon or too late sacrifices important flexibility and could cause you to forfeit important savings opportunities.
Once the application is accepted by the Texas Department of Health and Human Service, it’s “cast in stone.” Failure to meet the guidelines before sending in the application could cost you thousands of dollars a month that Medicaid may have been willing to pay.
Why spend more than necessary?
You’re far better off arranging your assets and income in advance of the application. You have far more planning flexibility before you apply. That flexibility translates to potentially greater financial savings and far less emotional stress.
Before submitting any Medicaid application to help pay nursing home fees, call me first. You’ll find out very quickly (sometimes in minutes) whether we can save you money and heartache. After hundreds of applications on behalf of clients, my staff and I know how to make your life easier.
To put it bluntly, applying for Texas Medicaid Nursing Home financial help is a daunting process.
First you need to know how Medicaid rules will treat the type and amount of assets you own. Some assets count, others don’t. Some don’t count when the caseworker determines eligibility but could be exposed later (like your personal residence). Some count now but can be made uncountable. Knowing the rules and procedures allow you to craft a plan to protect every penny allowed under the law.
Medicaid also classifies the type of income you receive every month. Pensions, social security and investment income are considered “countable,” but other types like certain benefits from the Veteran’s Administration) are not.
If you’re married, you may be able to transfer certain types of income to your spouse. Medicaid willingly reduces the amount you have to pay every month to the nursing home, increases their share and increases the amount of money your spouse gets to keep.
But you need to know the rules.
Once your assets and income are properly aligned with Medicaid rules, it’s time to submit the application. What you provide and when you provide it are another critical part of the process. Precision is important. Applying too soon or too late could mean losing valuable benefits. So could failure to submit the right type of documentation.
The path to applying to Medicaid for help paying nursing home care is full of hidden potholes, dangerous curves and obstacles in the road. We’ve driven that road many times so we’re prepared to address and solve most problems before they happen.
I can help you apply for Texas Nursing Home Medicaid benefits. Call me today at 713-970-1300 or use my online contact form. Discover how you can get help paying for care and get peace of mind in the process.
The Holland Law Firm did a wonderful job on my fathers behalf. Martin Sabel has been a godsend. If someone needs an elder care attorney, this would be the one firm I would recommend any day.	
Susan Medve
I want to thank Michael Holland, Martin and Kathy for their kindness and help no matter when we called for assistance.	
Marvin Corbitt
I was a bit skeptical at first, but your confidence convinced me I was in good hands for mom’s needs. I kept getting feedback that Holland Law Firm was the experts we needed. I know this approval for Medicaid could not have happened without the Holland firm’s team of experts. My sincere thanks!	
Sylvia Hornbacker
The folks at Holland Elder Law are awesome. I've worked with them on a Trust account for my Mom for a year (intial set-up and annual benefits renewal). The original contact was thorough and they made it easy for me to understand. With their help the Trust account has enabled our family to enjoy each other free from the strain and worry of "what happens next." Thank you to Spencer for answering the questions on the initial call and promptly sending me the information I needed to get started. Martin Sabel is a life changer and our family is eternally grateful for his help, expertise, and ultimately, his friendship. These folks really know their stuff and care about their clients.	
Carol S
You put me at ease and guided me through every question I had. No question was too simple and every call was answered in a timely manner. Our family is very thankful to you...	
Gloria Robinson
Your staff was so professional, helpful, and candid with me when I called, I knew I had the right place to help with the challenge. Thank you to you and your staff!!! As I am sure you know from the many cases this is a difficult time and Martin and Kathy have helped me relax and feel like we are able to manage the best for Eric & my Aunt.
Thank you!!!	
Ann Keibler
We feel so fortunate to have hired Michael Holland and his staff to deal with Medicaid and all the stress of the application. They made the entire experience so much easier and worry-free. It is the best thing ever...	
Henry and Patricia Zimmerman
I feel gratitude and comfort knowing my father will be taken care of financially. I definitely recommend the Holland Law Firm.	
Sue Pfeils
I am one of those people that requires a reference before using an individual or service and I give a strong recommendation to the entire Holland Law Firm. You took charge of the process, saw it to a successful completion and followed up and remained available.	
Chris Pinkard
I can say only positive words about the Holland Elder Law Firm. A few years ago my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. While touring nursing facilities, another law firm was referred to me. Unfortunately I did not perform my due diligence and opted to hire the firm to handle my case. I wish I would have found Holland then. The other firm was vague, lacked communication, and of course, overcharged. This was the polar opposite of my experience with the Holland. They were clear, concise and explained everything thoroughly to me. They always responded to my emails and typically within a couple of hours, unlike the previous firm that may not respond at all or would take several days to respond. I was not nickeled and dimed. I wish I would have found them to begin with, especially Martin. He is a rockstar and made the entire process SO easy.

Description Biography
We live in an age of accelerations and great change. To understand the twenty-first century, Thomas L Friedman, noted New York Times columnist (and known as the author President Obama reads), shows how the planet’s three largest forces – the advance of technology, globalisation and climate change – are each driving the other and fundamentally reshaping the world.
He travelled the world to meet tech giants, engineers and political and social innovators to discover exactly who is inventing the software, shaping the social vision and directing the markets that are changing our lives in this new age.
He explains the urgency of harnessing the increasing power of Artificial Intelligence to non-destructive ends. He explores the rise of the super-empowered individuals and companies, considers the demise of whole states likely to fail if they can’t keep up, and offers a guide on how to adapt to this era of acceleration without losing our humanity. In today’s changing world of Brexit and Donald Trump’s promises of walls and tariffs, Friedman argues that it is only openness to ideas and trade that will allow us all to thrive. He addresses the need for politically moral leadership; how to build resilient and prospering citizens; and why ‘stempathy’ – the ideal skill set for the jobs of the future (science, technology, maths and empathy) – is needed. There’s no better guide to the world we live in now and the changes that will follow.

Neuropathic pain drug development
“We have enjoyed highly productive collaborations with Profs. Rice and Anand. Their expertise [..] has significantly accelerated our drug discovery and development programs.”
http://www.spinifexpharma.com/
Client: Spinifex Pharmaceuticals
Consultant:
Professor Andrew Rice, Department of Surgery and Cancer.
Professor Praveen Anand, the Centre for Clinical Translation, Division of Brain Sciences
Expertise: Pharmaceuticals, Neuropathic pain expertise
Our consultants shared their expertise in neuropathic pain area treatments to support Spinifex’s drug discovery and development programs.
The Challenge
Spinifex needed support on the clinical development of EMA401 as a novel target for pain. More specifically, the challenge was to establish proof of efficacy data for EMA401 in animal models of antiretroviral-induced peripheral nervous system damage.
The Solution
Professor Rice and Professor Anand used their clinical expertise to guide the overall development of EMA401. They carried out tests on the effects of EMA401 on postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent nerve pain that can sometimes develop in patients following the shingles condition and provided proof of it’s efficacy. In addition, their involvement also led them to contribute to the design of a recently successful phase II clinical trial, with Professor Rice leading the protocol development.
The Impact
The EMA401 trial showed that the drug successfully reduces pain with minimal side effects in comparison to individuals who had taken a placebo over the same length of treatment. There is currently no existing painkiller that is effective in all PHN sufferers, hence this result is generating much interest.
Dr Tom McCarthy, CEO of Spinifex explains:
We have enjoyed highly productive collaborations with Profs. Rice and Anand. Their expertise in the neuropathic pain area and their leadership in the translation of fundamental pre-clinical research into innovative pain management has significantly accelerated our drug discovery and development programs.
Dr Tom McCarthy
CEO, Spinifex
Professor Rice adds:
Positive phase II studies are few and far between in neuropathic pain drug development, especially for completely novel targets, and these results are therefore the subject of some excitement. The contributions of Imperial academics to this success is a good example of the breadth of drug development capabilities and expertise available at the College.
Professor Andrew Rice
Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London
Professor Anand is continuing his foundational mechanism of action and translational research on EMA401. In addition, he is the Principal Investigator on an ongoing clinical trial of EMA401 in patients suffering from chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.
Following on this success, 2015 saw the acquisition of both Spinifex and the AT2 programme by Novartis, which is a testament to the progress made within the development of new drugs for the treatment of chronic pain and to the success of the AT2 programme.

Overburdened With Debt
Hundreds of career-training programs risk losing access to federal student aid funds without improved standing under rule designed to hold institutions accountable for graduates' ability to pay off debt.
By
Andrew Kreighbaum
January 10, 2017
Comments
Nearly a tenth of vocational programs assessed by the Department of Education failed to meet new criteria measuring whether graduates are able to repay their federal student loans -- 98 percent of them at for-profit institutions. That puts them at risk of losing access to federal student aid funding -- a potential death knell for programs.
The department designed the gainful employment rule to hold vocational programs accountable for how much student loan debt graduates took out relative to their discretionary income -- the first time institutions have been held accountable based on that metric. But for-profit-college groups and some Republican lawmakers have criticized the rule for targeting the sector and excluding nonvocational programs. GOP congressional leaders have said the rule is among a number of Obama administration regulations they plan to roll back after winning control of the White House and Congress in November.
Among the institutions with multiple programs classified as failing in gainful employment ratings released by the department Monday: Sanford-Brown, the Art Institutes, ITT Technical Institute, Minnesota School of Business, and Full Sail University. All but one institution with multiple failing career education programs were for-profits. The lone exception, Wright Career College, closed in April 2016.
More than 800 vocational programs were designated as failing. Another 1,200 out of 8,637 total programs received a “zone” rate designation -- not quite failing but in danger of being disqualified for federal aid programs without eventual improvement.
Education Secretary John B. King Jr. said the data published as part of the new rule would help prospective students make decisions about which schools and programs to apply to based on the ability of past graduates to find jobs, their earnings and whether they are able to repay their student loans.
King said that postsecondary education is still the best investment someone can make in their future, but that the quality of the program matters.
“Far too many hardworking students are graduating with certificates or degrees that have little or no value on the job market,” he said in a call with reporters Monday.
Earnings data published by the department in November showed that, over all, graduates of certificate programs at public colleges earned significantly more than graduates of such programs at for-profit colleges. That’s partly because students at public colleges were more likely to have entered relatively higher-earning fields like nursing.
The ratings released Monday, which incorporate student debt-to-income ratios, also rated for-profits poorly. Out of more than 800 failing programs, 98 percent were based at for-profit institutions. And for-profits accounted for two-thirds of programs that earned the zone rating. More than 5,600 programs assessed in the Department of Education data were for-profits.
Failing institutions have an annual loan payment exceeding 30 percent of graduates' discretionary income or 12 percent of their total earnings. And graduates of programs with the zone rating have an annual loan payment between 20 to 30 percent of discretionary income or between 8 to 12 percent of total income.
“It’s clear the low performance is concentrated in the for-profit sector,” said Under Secretary Ted Mitchell. “Many of these programs leave graduates with substantial debt and very low earnings.”
On the other hand, zero community colleges appeared among the list of failing certificate programs, he said.
Failing programs have 30 days to notify students that they are at risk of losing eligibility for federal student aid. Programs counted as failing for two out of three consecutive years will no longer qualify for use of Title IV funds like federal direct student loans and Pell Grants. And zone-rated schools will be cut off from federal funds if they go four consecutive years without improving.
Steve Gunderson, president and CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the largest for-profit industry group, said the department should not have published a public list of failing programs before institutions could exhaust the process to appeal the ratings.
That would include 14 days to file a notice of appeal, 60 days to file an appeal, and the additional time for the department to rule on the case.
“The department’s decision to publish a list of schools failing their initial calculations before the process is complete makes clear this is all about political motivations and harming institutions, and has nothing to do with expanding higher education access and opportunity or creating sound public policy,” Gunderson wrote in a statement.
“We had hoped this department would comply with the timelines and procedures it had established. Unfortunately we should not have expected even this minimum level of decency from them.”
The Department of Education had long said it planned to publish data on individual programs in January. And the process leading up to the release of the data Monday included a “challenge” period for institutions to present evidence that federal data on their programs was inaccurate.
But CECU said a number of institutions have reported differences with the department's calculations, and some programs could be moved from failing to zone or passing long after the data is published this week.
The University of Phoenix said in a statement that it will continue to support current students attending programs at risk of losing eligibility for Title IV funding, partly by making them aware of their options. Phoenix will also start an institutional grant program to cover costs for students in good academic standing should a program lose eligibility for federal aid.
Although Republicans have pledged to eliminate gainful employment, Debbie Cochrane, vice president of the Institute for College Access and Success, said the rule addresses two issues -- the burden of student debt and the ability of graduates to find well-paying jobs -- that President-elect Donald Trump spoke about on the campaign trail.
“I don’t think that fate of the rule is in any way a foregone conclusion,” Cochrane said. “The idea schools should be leaving students and taxpayers better off is a notion with bipartisan support.”

This is a legal agreement between you and I Say Organic Pvt. Ltd. (ISOPL), i.e. the company which is the licensed owner of the brand “I Say Organic” and the website www.ISayOrganic.com".
1) Membership Eligibility
Use of the Website is limited to persons who can form legally binding contracts under Indian Contract Act, 1872. Persons who are "incompetent to contract" within the meaning of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 including minors, un-discharged insolvents etc. are not eligible to use the Website. If you are a minor, i.e. under the age of 18 years, and wish to use or transact on the Site, such use must be made with the consent and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these terms and conditions, and transactions must be made by your legal guardian or parents on the Site.
2) ISOPL Service
The ISOPL Service is a transaction, information and communication service available to authorized users ("customers") who access ISayOrganic.com. ISayOrganic.com currently provides an online shopping and delivery service for organic vegetable, fruits, and other groceries, and may in the future provide additional shopping and related services.
ISOPL’s employees, agents or designees will deliver the orders placed on the Site, or through another medium like telephone. ISOPL sells products under the “I Say Organic” brand, and may also in future sell products of other companies sold under their respective brand. Prices of the “I Say Organic” branded products, which includes all fresh produce i.e. fruits and vegetables, sold on the Site are set by ISOPL. Prices of products of other companies will be sold at MRP unless otherwise specified. Delivery will be made to the delivery address that you specify when you confirm your order. Prices for products you place in your cart will be guaranteed for the transaction. Payment for your order and delivery fees, if any, is due at the time of delivery, if not already paid for through an online payment. You are responsible for ensuring that someone is present at the delivery address to receive and pay for deliveries at the specified time of delivery. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive and pay for the order. If ISOPL cannot deliver your order, or must make an additional delivery because no one is at the delivery address to receive and pay for the order at the specified time, or wrong address / details given to us by you, you might be assessed an additional fee. If you are not satisfied for any reason with an item purchased through the ISOPL Service, you may email feedback@ISayOrganic.com or call customer service on 011-41087447 at the time of receiving your order. ISOPL's liability for missing a delivery is limited to delivery at a later agreed time at no additional charge.
(a) Pricing: All the products listed on ISayOrganic.com will be sold at MRP unless otherwise specified. The prices mentioned at the time of placing an order are the applicable prices. Prices of non perishable products do not fluctuate on a daily basis but those of many perishables can change on a daily basis which would be updated almost immediately on the portal.
(b) Cancellation Policy: You as a customer can cancel your order anytime up to the cut-off time of the slot for which you have placed an order by calling our customer service. In such a case we will refund any payments already made by you for the order. If we suspect any fraudulent transaction by any customer or any transaction which defies the terms & conditions of using the website, we at our sole discretion could cancel such orders. We will maintain a negative list of all fraudulent transactions and customers and would deny access to them or cancel any orders placed by them. However, if there are changes in the delivery slot time you requested or need to add more products, you need to edit your order by logging into your account on the Site, or call customer care on 011-41087447.
(c) Return & Refunds: At the time of delivery, you can return whatever you are not happy with and we will make the necessary adjustments to your order value. However, please note, if a product is returned due to a change in mind and your order value goes below our minimum order requirement, you will be assessed an additional delivery fee. In case you have already paid for the returned item previously (through an online transaction, or subscription), a credit will be offered for future transactions. For a particular item, a partial return is not possible. For instance, if you are unhappy with 2 pieces of cucumber out of 5, you will have to return all 5 pieces.
For complaints we receive after the delivery pertaining to quality issues, a credit will be offered for the next delivery. Complaints received after 3 days of delivery for fresh produce (fruits and vegetables) will be handled on a case by case basis. This is because some more perishable or tender vegetables don't have a shelf life greater than that. We guarantee freshness at the time of delivery, so we encourage people to send in complaints ideally at the time of delivery, or else soon after, so that refunds/credits can be easily processed.
There are a few characteristics of organic produce that need to be accepted by customers. In cases where a customer does not acknowledge this, he/she has the option of returning the products at the time of delivery, however refunds or credit after payment will not be accepted. The following are some examples:
Produce might be unevenly shaped, might not be very shiny or big. But it should be good inside. Organic is not about perfect looks, and doesn't rely on artificial growth promoters or chemicals to enhance physical appeal. The vegetables look like nature intended them to. This might be very apparent in cases of things like apples, which otherwise are infamous for heavy chemical and wax use (to make them look pretty), while in some cases the vegetables will look no different than a chemically grown vegetable There might be slight variations in color, size, and taste over the season of the vegetable. Again, it is because the characteristics of the vegetable can change with the weather.
On rare occasions, customers find a bug or 2 inside a vegetable. We are not referring to a big bug that has eaten a chunk of a vegetable, but a small bug inside a cucumber, or a piece of okra or brinjal. This is actually proof it is organic! A simple solution is to cut away the infested part and use the rest. To be safe, you can boil the vegetable well.

Why Pastor Goodheart Ekwueme Resigned From House on the Rock Church in Abuja
By JENNY CHISOM October 18, 2016
I have been in pains!
If you follow me on Instagram, you will notice, I put up my pastor and coach's picture last weekend because I was heart broken.
He is Pastor Goodheart Ekwueme, the outgone (as much as I hate to use that) resident pastor of my local assembly in Abuja. I and all those who knows him, are going to miss him soooooooo much, it hurts.

Violence Against Men, Mnombo Madyibi and The VAPP Bill
By JENNY CHISOM October 12, 2016
Quite some fuss has been on about this man in picture MnomboMadyibi who was allegedly hit with a bottle of wine and also suffered attempted suffocation using a red and white teddy bear. But as expected it did not get as much attention like if the switch was fixed (the experience being that of the woman).
We must know that if men keep being treated like non humans, even the violence against women we usually fight for, will only increase astronomically, since after all a woman must live and find her fulfilled being married to a man or at least living and being in relationships with them.

Benjamin Franklin Wasn't a Fan of Advocate
Verb
Benjamin Franklin may have been a great innovator in science and politics, but on the subject of advocate, he was against change. In 1789, he wrote a letter to his compatriot Noah Webster complaining about a "new word": the verb advocate. Like others of his day, Franklin knew advocate primarily as a noun meaning "one who pleads the cause of another," and he urged Webster to condemn the verb's use. In truth, the verb wasn't as new as Franklin assumed (etymologists have traced it back to 1599), though it was apparently surging in popularity in his day. Webster evidently did not heed Franklin's plea. His famous 1828 dictionary, An American Dictionary of the English Language, entered both the noun and the verb senses of advocate.

In Michigan, a conservative clean energy playbook emerges
April 20, 2018
Renewable energy is getting cheaper and more popular, even among Republican voters, and that makes now a better time than ever for conservative candidates to support clean energy policies.
Author: Andy Balaskovitz
Photo By: David Wilson / Creative Commons
That was the message at this week’s annual Michigan Conservative Energy Forum conference in Lansing, where Republicans rallied around renewable energy and free-market principles. The group formed in 2013 and has since spawned a 20-state coalition seeking a seat at the clean-energy table long dominated by liberal and environmental groups.
“Here in Lansing, we’re ground zero for this state-based conservative clean energy movement taking shape across the country,” said Conservative Energy Network President Mark Pischea. “If you’re a Republican elected official and want to take a bold position on clean energy, we’ll have your back.”
Here are four priorities as the group organizes around clean energy in Michigan and around the country:
Debunk the myth that renewables cost more.
Yes, state and federal tax credits helped solar and wind gain a foothold in the market, but those incentives are ramping down as unsubsidized renewables become competitive with coal and natural gas. Michigan utilities also eliminated renewable energy surcharges on customer bills years ago.
“The conversations we’re having now with legislators and party leaders is very different” due to declining costs, Pischea said. “If you dispel the myths like we are today, that’s a game-changer.”
“The biggest obstacles we face are a lack of education and cronyism.” - Mark Pischa, President of Conservative Energy Network
Support market access for independent producers.
Market access for third-party, renewable developers is an ongoing fight at the Michigan Public Service Commission. Conservatives and clean energy advocates believe the private sector should have equal opportunity to sell power to regulated utilities.
Advocates say regulators play a role in opening the market to third-party developers through issues like PURPA contracts and standby rates. The conservative group also opposes DTE Energy’s plan to build a $1 billion, 1,100-megawatt natural gas plant, arguing that independent producers, renewables and demand-side options are cheaper.
Wake up to the fact that voters like renewables.
Renewable energy is an increasingly important issue among Republican and independent voters and could be a factor in this year’s elections, Pischea said.
“We aren’t suggesting energy is a wedge issue like taxes, but it is becoming more important,” he said.
The results of a poll it commissioned will be released in the coming weeks. Similar polls in Ohio were criticized by Republican lawmakers this year, but Pischea said the divide among conservatives is “not as significant” as it was five years ago.
“The biggest obstacles we face are a lack of education and cronyism,” Pischea said.
Support policies that create choice and competition.
The group’s biggest goal is getting the state legislature to separate power generation and distribution. Michigan Conservative Energy Forum executive director Larry Ward says this would create more choice and competition. Transmission and distribution lines to customers would remain regulated and monopolized through “one set of wires” owned by the utility, Ward said.
“This is a true free-market solution,” Ward said.
The group is in the early stages of behind-the-scenes work with legislators on the plan. While there may be interest in the House, the state Senate hasn’t taken up energy policy since 2016 when sweeping energy bills were passed.

Which Kind of Booze Is Best for the Planet?

Murder in Detroit, overworked immigration judges, bruisers-for-hire on Indian reservations: If you’ve been reading Mother Jones lately, you’re probably ready for a stiff drink. Not so fast! In terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, US booze manufacturers release the annual equivalent of 1.9 million households. How’s that for a buzzkill? The good news is that you have choices. Here are a few tips for drowning your sorrows sustainably.
WINE: Fruity bouquet? Tastes like pencil shavings? Environmentally speaking, none of that matters: According to a 2007 study (PDF) commissioned by the American Association of Wine Economists, the majority of wine’s carbon footprint comes from shipping. You can minimize your wine miles by using the handy map below. In short, New Yorkers should buy French, while Iowans are better off drinking California wines. If you’re concerned about water use, go for bubbly wines made with early-harvested grapes. TRY: French Rabbit wines. They come in recyclable Tetra Paks, which reduce packaging weight by 90 percent over bottles. For reasonably priced organic wines, try Frey Vineyards—if the map allows.
The Wine Line
If you live east of this line, European wines are better for your carbon footprint. Western oenophiles? Go green by buying Napa.
BEER: In 2008, New Belgium Brewing Company commissioned an environmental analysis (PDF) of its Fat Tire Amber Ale and found that refrigeration accounted for almost one-third of its overall greenhouse-gas emissions. Glass production was second, contributing 22 percent. Though aluminum production is an environmental disaster, cans beat bottles handily on the carbon front: Pablo Päster, a blogger and sustainability consultant, calculates that shipping cans rather than bottles results in 30 percent fewer emissions. And cans are recycled at significantly higher rates. Good news for your inner frat boy: Kegs are the most efficient vessels of all. TRY: New Belgium. The Colorado-based company brews in superefficient kettles and is entirely powered by renewables.
DISTILLED SPIRITS: As we learned in college, liquor is quicker than wine or beer. But producing it uses more energy, ounce for ounce, and nearly all the water that goes into the still emerges as waste. Here’s how selected spirits stack up.
Whiskey: Single malt Scotch is made from only one grain source, while most American whiskeys are made from mixtures of rye, corn, wheat, or barley. So which are greener? Most single malts are produced by boutique outfits using old-fashioned energy-hogging pot stills, as opposed to the more efficient column-style stills employed by major distillers. And while American bourbons are aged in virgin-oak barrels that are used only once, most of those barrels end up being reused by other liquor makers. TRY: Maker’s Mark. The bourbon maker buys local grain and turns its waste into energy. Most of the company’s land is a nature preserve.
Vodka and gin: Although some vodkas are still made from potatoes, most now come from a mix of grains. Ditto for gin. In terms of distillation, vodka requires more energy and water than most spirits. That’s because it’s distilled down to 95 percent ethanol—some ethanol plants even make vodka on the side—then diluted back to 40 percent. Gins are often made the same way. TRY: Square One vodka, which is organic and purchases one-quarter of its electricity from a local wind farm through renewable energy credits. TRU2 gin uses lightweight bottles and recyclable corks, and plants a tree for each bottle it sells.
Rum: The mojito enabler is made from molasses or cane juice, and its fibrous leftovers can throw off the microorganism balance in waterways. In 2001, the EPA sued Bacardi for illegally dumping 3,000 gallons of this goop into a river near its Puerto Rico plant. (Many major distillers now treat their water.) Sugarcane is also a notoriously destructive crop, producing massive amounts of wastewater and greenhouse gases. TRY: DonQ rum. The Puerto Rico-based distiller turns its waste into compost and irrigation water, and uses excess steam from its treatment plant to help power the still.
Tequila: Tequila’s waste problem is as bad as rum’s. For every liter of tequila, you get about 11 pounds of pulp and 10 liters of vinazas, or acidic waste—which ends up befouling soil and water in Mexico’s Jalisco state, where most tequila comes from. Blue agave farmers, meanwhile, have used more and more pesticides since their crops were chewed up by insects during the 1990s. TRY: Casa Noble or 4 Copas, the first tequilas to be certified organic.

TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
The Mueller report might not say it, but David Corn will. So amid the swirling headlines and cable chatter, David provides a clear and honest assessment of what we really know about Trump's actions: “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia's Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”
Even though Mueller may be done with his investigation, Mother Jones is not. David and his team in Washington have been digging deep on the Russian connections and other corruption scandals since before the 2016 election, and we're not stopping now. If you agree there's more to dig into and expose, please help our team do it with a tax-deductible donation today.

Supporters of senate hopeful Beto O'Rourke cheer during a Democratic watch party following the Texas primary election, Tuesday, March 6, 2018, in Austin, Texas.
See Returns For All Races Here
Women running for Congress surged to big wins and Democrats smashed recent turnout levels in Texas' first-in-the-nation 2018 primary elections, giving Republicans a potential glimpse of what's ahead in the first midterms under President Donald Trump.
Energized and angry Democrats in Texas, where the GOP has dominated for decades, came out in force to surpass 1 million voters Tuesday -- the first time the party has eclipsed that benchmark in a midterm primary since 2002, just months after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Equally striking was the showing by women on the ballot: Of the nearly 50 women running for Congress in Texas, more than half won their primaries outright or advanced to runoffs. What's more, at least three of those runoffs in May will feature women going head-to-head, including a key race for Democrats in their bid to take control of the U.S. House this fall.
"It's Trump. It's Trump," said Veronica Escobar, who won her Democratic primary and is now poised to become one of the first Hispanic women to represent Texas in Congress.
"I've spoken to innumerable senior citizens, retirees, parents of disabled children, people who understand what this administration means to their families. And they're afraid."
Not all women fared so well. Kathaleen Wall, a Republican megadonor in Houston who pumped $6 million of her own money into her race for Congress, failed to survive a crowded nine-person field despite outspending all other candidates and having the backing of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.
Wall's failure was also a potential warning sign of the limits of Republicans going all-in on Trump this election year. She partly staked her candidacy on TV ads that told voters there was little daylight between her and the president, who remains popular among GOP voters despite his rough edges and low approval ratings nationwide.
For all the talk of renewed Democratic energy heading into the 2018 midterms, Texas Republicans also set a new benchmark for turnout in a midterm election.
More than 1.5 million people voted Tuesday in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, won by incumbent Ted Cruz. That beats the previous record of 1.48 million in 2010, during former President Barack Obama's first term.
Democrats showed up despite the long odds this November of ousting Republicans such as Cruz -- who released a radio ad after clinching the GOP nomination Tuesday night, telling voters that Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke "wants to take our guns."
O'Rourke, a congressman from El Paso, has called for banning AR-15-style assault rifles in wake of last month's mass shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 people.
Neither that tragedy nor a mass shooting at a Texas church last fall played as dominant campaign issues in Texas, but with the GOP's majority in Congress on the line this fall, Democrats showed up.
Democrats have their sights on flipping three GOP-controlled congressional seats in Texas that backed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, including a Houston district where liberal favorite Laura Moser forced a runoff with Lizzie Pannill Fletcher. Another is a sprawling district that runs along the Texas-Mexico border, where Gina Ortiz-Jones advanced to a May runoff and another woman, Judy Canales, was battling to join her.
"I think that a Congress that is only 20 percent women is not where we need to be," Ortiz Jones said. "This is not a spectator sport. We've got to participate, all of us and that's what's important."
College students waited more than an hour to vote in liberal Austin and rural counties offered Democratic candidates for the first time in years. Many women ran in a record eight open congressional races this year in Texas -- two of which are up for grabs after longtime GOP incumbents abandoned plans for re-election amid scandal.
While 2002 was a high water mark for Democratic turnout in Texas it also showed the limits of the exuberance for turning the state blue. In November that year, the Democrats running for statewide office were all beaten, just as they have been since 1994.
For Republicans, the primary was a vivid exhibition of the Trump effect in GOP politics. George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner, won a contested primary after he cozied-up to a president who once called his dad, Jeb, a pathetic person.
Trump won Texas by 9 points in 2016. It was the smallest margin of victory by a Republican presidential candidate in Texas in 20 years, but Cruz dismissed talk of a Democratic takeover this fall.
"Left-wing rage may raise a bunch of money from people online, but I don't believe it reflects the views of a majority of Texans," he told reporters after winning the nomination.
Democrats will have a tough time winning statewide races in November despite the "Trump effect" because they have fielded little-known candidates against top Republicans, such as Republican Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. Even Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has been indicted on felony securities fraud charges, clinched his party's nomination unopposed.
Abbott will face either Lupe Valdez, who was Texas' first Hispanic, lesbian sheriff, or Andrew White, who opposes abortion and whose father, Mark, was governor in the 1980s.

Saami Reindeer Herders Fight Wind Farm Project
Europe’s largest onshore wind farm is being built in central Norway. But the project, which will more than double Norway’s wind capacity, lies in the middle of an important reindeer grazing area, leaving Saami herders worried about the impact it might have on their livelihood and traditions.

In early April, construction crews began building Europe’s largest onshore wind farm in central Norway. Once it is completed, it will have a capacity of 1,000 megawatts (MW) – more than the current installed wind capacity in Norway – and will produce 3.4 terawatt hours (TWh) of power annually, enough to supply 170,000 Norwegian households with electricity.
Most of the 278 wind turbines will be built on the Fosen Peninsula, near Trondheim. The area is known for its conifer forests, lakes and mountains, much loved by outdoor enthusiasts and used by reindeer herders and for agricultural activities.
But the project will leave a large environmental footprint. The Saami reindeer herders who use the land to graze their animals are concerned about the wind farm’s impact on their traditional industry and culture.
In Norway, the Saami have the right to use land for traditional activities, including reindeer herding. According to a recent U.N. report, the Saami graze about 200,000 reindeer on approximately 40 percent of Norway’s territory.
“It is evident that one of the largest onshore wind power facilities in Europe will have irreparable consequences for the reindeer owners who have drifted here since time immemorial,” said Thomas Åhren, a governing council member of the Saami Parliament of Norway, in a press release.

Compared with the overall area used for reindeer herding in the region – 4,200 square kilometers (1,600 square miles) – the area that will be used for the turbines is relatively small, roughly 70 square kilometers (27 square miles). But, in addition to the turbines, the region will see an increase in human activity, as well as new power lines and more than 241km (150 miles) of new roads.
Industrial projects have challenged reindeer herding communities in Norway for decades. The most famous dispute was the standoff over a hydroelectric project that occurred in Alta between 1979 and 1981. More recently, the Saami have come up against mining and energy corporations.
The joint venture company behind the current wind farm project, Fosen DA, argues that the development will create jobs in maintenance and machine work, and in the hospitality sector, to the benefit of the local economy. According to Statkraft, the largest shareholder of Fosen DA, the wind farms will create about 50 jobs once the farms are completed and generate about 70 million Norwegian kroner ($8.5 million) in property taxes for the municipalities. The project, estimated to be completed in 2020, will cost 11 billion Norwegian kroner ($1.33 billion).
Energy surplus in Norway
Economists have criticized the project for being redundant. Norway produces more energy than it uses. According to Statnett, which owns and operates the Norwegian power grid, the country produced 143TWh of electricity and consumed 128TWh in 2015. Opponents of the project also argue that it won’t have socioeconomic benefits, because the added energy surplus may reduce electricity prices and reduce the country’s revenues from selling power.
The project has been scrapped once before. In 2015, the government-owned company Statkraft, which was the driving force behind the development, decided it would be commercially irresponsible to implement, because of the energy surplus in the Nordic market; the moderate projected increase in electricity demand did not merit more production of electrical power.
But following the reactions from politicians and a request from Credit Suisse, the company reversed its decision 20 days later. After some modifications that included primarily the relocation some of the turbines, Fosen DA – owned 52.1 percent by Statkraft, 7.9 percent buy Trønderenergi and 40 percent by Nordic Energy Power, a company owned by Credit Suisse – decided to press on. Initially, the turbines located on the peninsula were to have a capacity of 650MW, but changes to the plan boosted capacity to 750MW. Some of the local reindeer herders called the decision a betrayal.
Statkraft argues that the added wind energy will be important for increasing the country’s electrification and for selling electricity to Europe. “Renewable production of energy will be increasingly important in the future when fossil fuels are gradually replaced,” said Knut Fjerdingstad, a spokesperson for Statkraft. Almost all of the electrical power used in Norway (98 percent) comes from renewable sources, mostly from hydroelectric plants, and renewable energy has started to replace fossil fuels in the transportation sector.
Norway currently has a limited ability to export its electricity, but this may change. The country exports electricity to Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Russia and the Netherlands via cross-border interconnectors – links to other electrical networks that make export and import of power possible. Oslo plans to build interconnectors to Germany and Great Britain in order to export renewable energy.
But the E.U. quota system means that the added renewable energy could have little effect on overall greenhouse gas emissions. A surplus of emission allowances under the E.U. Emissions Trading System has kept carbon prices low and reduced incentives to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Saami representatives have long supported efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, in part because climate change is also affecting the reindeer industry. But the new onshore wind farm project is one of many development projects in recent years that have put pressure on the reindeer industry.
Consequences for reindeers
Reindeer husbandry has been a part of the Saami culture for centuries. It is a semi-nomadic tradition in which herders follow their animals from pasture to pasture throughout the year. But the Saami are as diverse as other peoples and fewer than 5 percent of the 40,000–60,000 Saami living in Norway are involved in reindeer husbandry.
The local reindeer herders say the project will lead to the loss of pastures and disturb their animals. Several reports have shown that reindeers avoid areas where there are power lines. According to a report by the University of Oslo and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, this is primarily due to human activity along the access roads and maintenance work on the power lines. But it’s unclear if the conclusions of these studies, which were done in areas close to settlements, are transferable to the Fosen peninsula, where there is little human presence.
Fosen Vind is building Europe’s largest onshore wind power project in central Norway, comprising six wind farms, with a combined capacity of 1,000MW. (Statkraft)
Reindeer herding is collaborative enterprise. The areas used for herding are divided into districts that contain “siidas,” which are composed of one or several groups or groups of reindeer herders that own the animals in that area. The Fosen reindeer herding district contains 2,000 animals that belong to two siidas, at the northern and southern ends of the peninsula. Each of these siidas has three operating units, or shares, belonging to the reindeer owners.
According to Arvid Jåma, a local reindeer herder, one of the three units in South Fosen will have to close down and the herders will have to quit their practice as a consequence of the wind farm project. Jåma has fought against other development projects in the area in the past. “It is like David’s battle against Goliath,” he said.
In order to keep reindeer herding economically and ecologically sustainable, it is important for the animals to have enough space for grazing, especially in the spring during the calving period. Ellinor Marita Jåma, the director of the Reindeer Herders’ Association of Norway and a member of the Saami Parliament, told the Trønder-Avisa, a Norwegian newspaper, that limiting the size of the winter pastures will make reindeer herding unsustainable. She explained that the people impacted will be forced to give up their cultural heritage, basis of income and lifestyle.
Bearer of Southern Saami culture
According to Jåma, the project violates national and international law, including the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She is also concerned about the impact it will have on the Southern Saami culture. “Reindeer herding in the Southern Saami area is the bearer of the Southern Saami language and culture,” she said.
About 2,000 people are part of the Southern Saami, a subgroup that speaks a language that is significantly different from the other Saami languages. As the Southern Saami are small in number, they face a challenge to maintain their culture and language. Many are now concerned about the impact the wind farm project will have on their situation and some have argued that it violates Norway’s obligation to safeguard the rights of the Saami, including their ability to maintain culture, languages and traditions.
The reindeer herders are now preparing for a legal case to reverse the project. Lawyer Geir Haugen who represents the reindeer herders explained to Adresseavisen, a Norwegian newspaper, that if necessary they will take their case all the way to the Supreme Court of Norway and the U.N. Human Rights Committee.

After mistakenly labelled as lamb, a Hindu man consumed beef at the supermarket in New Zealand. The Hindu man demanded supermarket to pay for his flights back to India so he can be cleansed In India. Jaswinder Paul has claimed that he bought the meat from Countdown Blenheim on New Zealand’s South Island which according to him was the meat of the cow. Jaswinder later cooked the meat and after eating it the dish was beef instead of lamb.
As per Jaswinder, Cows are considered sacred In India and killing of cows is not permissible in the country. He also said that he should be purified by cleansing himself in India by priests to perform sacred bath for the next four to six weeks in order to maintain his faith as a devoted Hindu.
As per reports, Jaswinder moved to New Zealand around 20 years ago and started working as a barber there. Jaswinder now owns a brand barber shop in New Zealand.
He blamed that he could not visit India as he would have to sell his business in order to afford tickets to home. He also said that the company who labelled beef as lamb meat should pay for his tickets so that he may take a sacred bath in India.

Fake it 'til you make it: how to build confidence
Confidence may seem like an elusive quality you either have or you don’t, but it’s actually something you can build and foster.
Feb 25, 2019 7:45am
By Trudie McConnochie
Image: Getty Images
When you think about ways to boost your confidence, dancing awkwardly to Dancing Queen in front of a roomful of strangers probably isn't the first idea that comes to mind.
But that's exactly how Rob O'Donnell, a facilitator at the School of Life, starts his 'How to be Confident' class – urging students, in a you-don't-really-have-a-choice-about-this kind of way, to get on their feet and join him for a short stint of singing and dancing to ABBA.
Few people enjoy the cringe-worthy experience – certainly not Rob himself – but it does effectively tackle something that stands in the way for many people wanting more confidence: the fear of looking silly.
Rob, who has a background in learning and development, says feeling self-conscious is what often holds us back from approaching situations with confidence. But that doesn't mean people who appear to be confident don't feel worried about what others think of them.
"We all look at other people and we think, 'They must be really confident'. And when you go and talk to them you generally find they're nowhere near as confident as you think they are," he says.
"We tend to be hugely overgenerous to other people and hypercritical of ourselves."

Defining confidence is tricky, since it means different things to different people.
The dictionary describes it as "self-reliance, assurance or boldness" – and it's that last word which hints at one of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to confidence.
"I often hear Donald Trump mentioned as a person who displays confidence [but] I see him as a deeply, deeply insecure guy who overcompensates for it by being arrogant," says Rob.
"We tend to not really understand that you can be confident and subdued at the same time.
"You don't have to be shouting and brash and in the spotlight all the time – in fact, it's the people who are quietly confident we tend to admire the most."
What Rob wants people to understand most about confidence is that it isn't something you're either born with or you're not.
"Confidence is something you can develop over time – it's a skill that can be learned," he states.

Learning to back yourself
Trish Everett, a mindset coach who helps people build inner leadership, says confidence is about self-belief.
"It clicks into that 'I'm enough' business," she explains.
"The more belief people have that they are enough – that they have what it takes to be there – the more confident they are.
"That belief can be rocked in so many ways.
"In childhood, being told that you can't, that you're not good enough, that that's not the right place for you, that's not a place for girls to be, being criticised, being shamed… all of those things," says Trish.
"The earlier it happened, the more deeply ingrained it can be.
"But you can still have that kind of knock to your confidence at any point in your life."

Now To Love
Imposter syndrome – a sense of feeling unworthy of a job or relationship, for example, and the associated fear of being exposed as a fraud – is often underpinning a lack of confidence, she reveals.
"If someone walks into a room and their belief is 'I'm not supposed to be here' that usually will come from 'I'm not worthy enough to be here'.
"Without a belief that you're supposed to be there, your confidence doesn't come through," says Trish.
But even when you do have strong self-worth, your confidence may not be strong in all areas. That's because confidence can come and go depending on the situation, Rob contends.
"I give the example of Richard Branson in class – there's a guy who has a huge sense of self-worth, massive confidence and massive charisma in certain situations, particularly one-on-one, but he hates public speaking with a passion," he says.
"Self-worth doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be confident in all situations.
"There are some things that just freak people out."
The importance of being optimistic
To boost your confidence, Rob advocates a formula of self-efficacy plus optimism.
Self-efficacy is the belief that you have the ability to do what you want to do, or that you could master the ability to do it.
You can build this by practising the particular skill involved, getting support from others, looking for good role models and taking care of your physical and mental health.
The 'optimism' part, however, is a bit more challenging.
"We have these little voices in our heads and they can be quite critical," explains Rob.
"I've got a friend who refers to them as the 'itty bitty sh**ty committee.'"
The hallmarks of these pessimistic thoughts are:
Permanence – eg, "You always screw this up."
Pervasiveness – eg, "You screw everything up."
Personal – eg, "It's all your fault."
The best way to stop these thoughts is to tackle the relevant 'P' factor, explains Rob.
"If they say, 'You always screw this up', you respond with, 'No, I screwed it up last Thursday, but I've learned from that and here's how I'm going to do better'.
"You're making it temporary and positive," he says.
"If it's pervasive, for example, 'You suck at sports', you can say 'No, I suck at football but I'm good at archery'.
"When they tell you it's all your fault, accept responsibility for the parts that are, then look at what else was at fault."
After doing this exercise for a few months, Rob says the pessimistic thoughts lessened and even started to become quite optimistic thoughts.

Fake it ’til you make it
Without consistent effort to challenge your beliefs around self-worth, your confidence is unlikely to improve, Trish says.
She recommends finding a confidence partner – a friend, coach, colleague or peer – or using a journal, and regularly communicating where your confidence is lacking and how you intend to challenge that.
Another approach she recommends is positive self-talk – telling yourself regularly, 'I am confident, I can do this, I have value to give', which she says is particularly powerful when you say it into the mirror.
Body language is also helpful. Trish endorses 'power poses' – body positions that make you look and feel powerful.
"I've found them really useful," reveals Trish.
"For me, my big challenge was when I was in a big room full of people and it was also when I was speaking from a more vulnerable place. I would sit back on my chair, spread my arms and take up more physical space.
"That would really help me – you're acting as if you're confident.
"People who are confident don't make themselves small, they make their bodies take up the right amount of space," she adds.
Working on your posture so that you stand tall can also assist in projecting confidence – it's all about faking it 'til you make it.
"Confident people don't slouch!" she says.
"They stand upright."

Sally Quinn says she's not sorry for writing about her family's troubles in the Washington Post.
Sally Quinn: 'Absolutely no regrets'
By MICHAEL CALDERONE
02/25/2010 08:22 PM EST
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Sally Quinn, whose first novel was titled “Regrets Only,” doesn’t have any second thoughts about the writing of her “ dysfunctional family” drama in The Washington Post last week.
“I have absolutely no regrets at all,” Quinn told POLITICO.
Story Continued Below
While Quinn isn’t sorry about writing it, others — from family members to online critics to the paper’s top editor — are.
Quinn said Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli told her that if he’d seen it first, he wouldn’t have run the column explaining the “dueling weddings” of her son and stepson’s daughter and squabbles among family members. And now Brauchli has decided “The Party” — her irregularly appearing print column launched in November — is over.
But Quinn says she’s glad, because it was never intended to be a permanent column but, rather, to focus on holiday entertaining and “ generosity of spirit” — the sort of spiritually inspired get-together that would also work in “On Faith,” the WashingtonPost.com site she co-moderates with Newsweek Editor Jon Meacham.
“As soon as the holidays were over, it wasn’t working for me,” Quinn said. “I wanted it to be about faith. I wanted it to be about rituals around food and various religious holidays. It became very sort of contrived. I was trying to call it ‘The Party’ and yet write in a way that had some kind of spiritual connotation to it.”
And Quinn’s already written the book on throwing parties — literally: It was titled “The Party.” In recent years, Quinn, a longtime writer for the Post’s Style section, has increasingly focused on religious issues, and yet “The Party” column was generating a different set of questions. A reader, she said, might ask, “‘Do you think it would be OK to serve lasagna to my wife’s boss at a dinner party?’ And that’s not the type of conversation I had in mind.”
Still, the conversation Quinn jumped into last Friday didn’t have much to do with the column’s original concept either. But Quinn says there had been some “extremely hurtful” stories and comments online about the nuptials of Quinn Bradlee, her son with former Post Editor Ben Bradlee, that compelled her to discuss the family’s squabbles in the Post.
“Everyone has a dysfunctional family,” Quinn wrote. “Ours is no exception.”
Initially, Quinn was hesitant to discuss why her son’s wedding had been moved to the same date in April as that of the daughter of Ben Bradlee Jr. — Bradlee’s son from a previous marriage — and his former wife, Martha Raddatz, a correspondent for ABC News. When Politics Daily first wrote about the “dueling weddings” last week, Quinn declined to discuss the issue in any detail.
In the column, Quinn took the blame for the mix-up, writing that she passed the “save the date” card for the second wedding to Bradlee but that neither put it on their calendars.
“I just felt like if I wrote this, I would take the heat off them,” she said. “And boy, did I ever.”

Copenhagen: too soon for Obama?
The difficulty of passing laws in the Congress this year could weaken the US’s negotiating power for a new climate change treaty, a former US ambassador says.
European Voice
By	Jennifer Rankin	
1/7/09, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 5:07 PM CET
The United States will not be able to match the European Union’s goal of cutting carbon emissions by 20% by 2020, according to a former US ambassador to the EU.
“We are starting the race, or the sprint, for combating climate change well behind you in Europe,” said Stuart Eizenstat, who was the US special representative to the EU in 1993-96. “The notion that the US is going to 20% by 2020 in one fell swoop is unrealistic in our legislative process.”
President-elect Barack Obama, who will take office on 20 January, has proposed curbing US emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
At a conference in Brussels on 18 December, Eizenstat said: “I am as certain as I can be that by the end of this next Congress there will be a substantial piece of cap-and-trade legislation and mandatory targets signed by Barack Obama.” But he said that it would be “a tall order” to pass the laws before a crucial round of UN climate talks in Copenhagen in December 2009. He added: “It will be very difficult for the executive branch to negotiate a treaty in Copenhagen if Congress hasn’t passed domestic legislation with the parameters of the reductions.”
Beyond Kyoto
Eizenstat, who also served as deputy secretary of the treasury in the Clinton administration, described the meeting in Copenhagen as “an important step, but not the end of the game” in the fight against global warming. The Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012 and a deal at Copenhagen is widely seen as essential to allow a new treaty to come into force on time.
Eizenstat led the US team during negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol during the 1990s. But the US never signed the treaty after the Senate voted unanimously for the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which criticised Kyoto because of the absence of targets to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for developing countries.
Eizenstat said that the feelings evident in the Byrd-Hagel resolution had not dissipated and that emerging economies would need to agree to reduce their emissions. “No one is saying it has to be equal reductions… but it makes no sense to have only Annex 1 countries [rich countries who signed the treaty] making commitments and for the biggest emitters to be given a pass.”
The notion that the US is going to 20% in 2020 in one fell swoop is unrealistic in our legislative process
He also predicted that climate change would not be a priority during the new president’s first 100 days and, “when it comes to drawing up domestic laws on capping emissions, the issue will be cost, cost, cost”.
Patience
Peter Carl, an adviser to the French government, said at the 18 December gathering that an agreement was needed in Copenhagen and warned that people would lose confidence in the UN system if it does not deliver. “Patience with this kind of system is running out fast and we must not miss the opportunity to do something in December,” he said.
Carl, who served as director-general of the European Commission’s environment department until June 2008, said that the final deal on the EU’s climate-change package, reached by EU heads of state and government in December, had in some respects “slightly improved” the Commission’s original proposal. He singled out the setting up of a legal framework and a potential €9 billion funding to build carbon capture and storage (CCS) test sites as “perhaps the most important aspect of this package”. “If we are successful in establishing CCS as a commercially viable proposition, than that would be worth more than the rest of the package,” Carl said.
EU measures
The EU’s climate package has been criticised by greens for allowing countries to reach their targets to reduce CO2 by buying emission credits from developing countries via the clean development mechanism (CDM). Carl, a well-known sceptic of carbon offsetting, noted that improvements to the CDM were “very badly needed”.
Eizenstat told the European Voice that some EU regulations were “politically driven” rather than “in accordance with sound science”.
Eizenstat has often criticised EU regulations as barriers to transatlantic trade. Last year, he lobbied the Commission against a ban on DecaBDE (a brominated flame retardant) and an attempted ban of MMT (a manganese fuel additive in petrol). He said that both these cases revealed “a little bit of an Alice in Wonderland concept with the punishment first and the science later”.
He added that the EU was making progress and was “trying to build in more scientific processes”, but too many regulations were not based on science. Last month, the EU agreed new standards on fuel quality that will see MMT reduced to two milligrams per litre of petrol by 2014 unless its US-based manufacturer can prove it is safe. Eizenstat said that this was “better than a ban, but it is putting the cart before the horse”.

Lars Svendsen Dispels Assumptions About Loneliness
Jon Morris
05 Apr 2017
In A Philosophy of Loneliness, Svendsen doesn't so much elucidate the topic of loneliness as he complicates it, thereby dispelling our many illusions.

Future historians will be able to glean much about the zeitgeist of the new millennium simply by perusing some of the titles of Norwegian philosopher Lars Svendsen’s books: A Philosophy of Evil, A Philosophy of Fear, A Philosophy of Boredom, and his latest to be translated into English, A Philosophy of Loneliness. Indeed, each book might easily make a chapter in a lengthier study of the early 21st Century.
In some ways A Philosophy of Loneliness is a bit of a departure from Svendsen’s other monographs. He begins, for instance, with a caveat that's worth quoting in full since it helps to explain why what follows is nothing close to a coherent “philosophy” of loneliness, at least in the more prosaic sense of the word, to wit, a systematic theory.
Almost all I thought I knew about loneliness proved false. I thought more men than women were lonely, and that lonely people were more isolated than others. I assumed that the significant increase in the number of single dwellers would notably impact the number of lonely individuals. I thought social media generated more loneliness by displacing ordinary sociability. I also believed that loneliness, despite being a subjective phenomenon, could be better understood in the context of social surroundings than individual disposition. I believed that the Scandinavian countries had higher degrees of loneliness, and that these numbers were increasing. Furthermore, I assumed that this increase was connected to late modern individualism and that individualistic societies had higher rates of loneliness than collective societies.
He confesses, “Never have I worked with a subject that overturned to such an extent all the assumptions I brought to the table.”
Herein lie both the appeal and frustration of the book. As readers, we search desperately, perhaps naïvely, for a cause and effect formula, for ready facts that will help us to identify the causes and cures for loneliness, and those desires are duly thwarted. This is not a book that will help leaders or managers design public policies that will put an end to loneliness.
On the other hand, as Daniel J. Boorstin points out in his book, Cleopatra’s Nose, just as important as the great philosopher or creator is the “negative discoverer”. “The negative discoverer is the historic dissolver of illusions,” Boorstin says. “The history of Western science confirms the aphorism that the great menace to progress is not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.”
Unlike more traditional philosophy books, Svendsen’s draws from and analyzes numerous empirical studies. He is aware that by doing so some will question whether his book is appropriately titled, but defends his decision to do so by arguing that “the distinction between philosophy and science is rather recent -- and this new turn towards empirical sciences can be regarded as a return to a traditional mode of philosophy, rather than a radical departure from philosophy as such.”
Some sections do indeed read like psychology papers. For example, the chapter entitled “Who are the Lonely?” is so replete with numerical schema and explications of various studies that one finds oneself overwhelmed by such contradictory data. Which is precisely the point.
What makes identifying the lonely so problematic is that loneliness is subjective, and therefore any definition of loneliness is tricky. To be alone is not necessarily to be lonely, and solitude can be revitalizing. Svendsen rightly points out that in English it is difficult to determine whether loneliness should be considered a feeling (generally considered physical) or an emotion (generally considered mental). Moods tend to be existential in nature and communicate our sense of being in the world, while emotions tend to be more specifically situational. Moreover, because loneliness may be perceived as a social failure, many will be unwilling to admit to being lonely, perhaps even to themselves. Others, instead, may have relatively rich relationships and still identify themselves as lonely.
Ultimately, Svendsen defines loneliness loosely as “social withdrawal, a feeling of discomfort or pain that informs us that our need for attachment to others is not satisfied.” Which begs the question: Is loneliness an individual problem or a social one?
In one of the most provocative chapters, “Loneliness and Trust”, one is struck by the extent to which many Western societies seem to be structured so as to preclude trust and to foster loneliness. “Countries whose inhabitants exhibit higher degrees of interpersonal trust are consistently those with a relatively low prevalence of loneliness. Similarly, countries with low trust levels are consistently those with high loneliness levels.”
If it is true that “if you learn to trust others, and to interpret their words, expressions and gestures as less threatening, you will also be able to relate more immediately to them, and therefore improve the conditions necessary for forming attachments”, it would appear equally self-evident that Western nations are not in a particularly trusting mood. In the US, Donald Trump was elected on a platform promising a wall along the border with Mexico, and almost immediately after taking office issued a travel ban on immigrants from Muslim countries. In Europe, Brexit must also be considered another compelling example of “withdrawal” and lack of trust.
Of course, citizens of Western nations are also regularly subjected to the terrifying theater of airport security and alarming daily headlines about hacked email accounts, identity theft, sweeping governmental data collection, various financial crises, CCTV, church sex scandals, and mass shootings (particularly in the US, where guns are ubiquitous). So, wherefore trust?
Svendsen does not answer the question, but warns, “mistrust prevents you from reaching outside yourself. By shutting others out, you also shut yourself inside. And loneliness will most likely accompany you there.”
Always conversational in tone, in the last chapter of the book, “Loneliness and Responsibility”, Svendsen is even more intimate than usual, at times addressing the reader directly and making it clear that he is aware that his audience may very well consist of “the lonely” so difficult to empirically identify.
“I cannot tell you why you are lonely, if in fact you are. I have discussed some of the social circumstances and psychological characteristics that increase a person’s chance of experiencing loneliness, but it is up to you to determine the relevance this discussion has for you, in terms of the causes and basis of your particular loneliness. Perhaps some of the material presented in this book can also function as a corrective for your self-understanding.”
In A Philosophy of Loneliness Svendsen does not so much elucidate the topic of loneliness as he complicates it, thereby dispelling the many illusions we may have harbored about our understanding of it. Leafing through my own edition, I find I have highlighted numerous passages that warrant greater reflection. Many of them are in fact positive, such as Svendsen’s assertion that “loneliness creates a space in which we can reflect on our relationship to others, and feel how much we actually need them.” Or this provocative passage about solitude in our era of omnipresent technology and social media: “Solitude is a freedom space, and establishing a private sphere is key to securing such freedom.”
Neither a systematic theory nor a self-help book, A Philosophy of Loneliness is a valuable contribution to the literature of “negative discovery”.

Two brothers arrested in New Orleans parade shooting
Police suspect the pair, who each face 20 counts of attempted second-degree murder in the Mother's Day attack, were involved in a neighborhood gang.

NEW ORLEANS — Two brothers with a history of drug arrests and ties to a neighborhood gang each face 20 counts of attempted second-degree murder in a shooting spree that brought a sudden bloody end to a neighborhood Mother’s Day parade.
The arrests by city police and U.S. marshals came less than four days after gunfire scattered the crowd and wounded 20 people — 19 hit by bullets and one while trying to flee.

Akein Scott, 19, was arrested without incident late Wednesday at an eastern New Orleans residence. His brother Shawn Scott, 24, was arrested Thursday morning as he tried to flee another residence in the city, police said.
Mayor Mitch Landrieu and police Chief Ronal Serpas hailed the police work as proof of officials’ determination to end sporadic violence that mars the image of the tourism-dependent city.
“We will not let up,” Landrieu said. “We are demanding that the shooting stop. And we will make sure that we do everything in our power, which I hope people now see is substantial, to make sure that we protect the citizens of New Orleans.”
A magistrate judge set bond for Akein Scott at $10 million Thursday morning in the attempted murder case. Another judge later ordered him held without bond pending a later hearing on an unrelated gun and weapon charge.
Shawn Scott’s court appearances were pending. His Thursday morning arrest was announced by Serpas, Landrieu and District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro at a news conference in the middle of the intersection where the shooting took place, off the beaten path for most tourists but less than 2 miles from the popular French Quarter. Surrounding the officials were dozens of uniformed officers and onlookers from the neighborhood.
Police said Akein Scott has been identified by an unnamed witness as the person seen on a surveillance video, appearing to fire into a crowd that immediately scatters as some fall. Shawn Scott’s role in the shootings was unclear Thursday afternoon. Court proceedings were not yet scheduled for the older brother.
Police have yet to outline a specific motive for the shooting, other than to say it appears related to gang activity, which Landrieu called a major factor in New Orleans street violence.
“This small number of people in gangs and groups are responsible for the overwhelming number of murders and shootings in this city. They are in fact terrorizing our streets,” Landrieu said.
Rafael Goyeneche, president of an independent watchdog group called the Metropolitan Crime Commission, said the numerous loosely knit gangs in New Orleans should not be confused with the large groups that battle for criminal control of large sections of other big cities.
Police said the Scotts are members of a gang called the Frenchmen and Derbigny Boys. Frenchmen and North Derbigny streets intersect a few blocks from the shooting site. Court records show Shawn Scott has a history of at least three drug arrests on one block of Frenchmen Street.
In addition to the brothers, police said they arrested four people who are accused of helping Akein Scott elude capture. Justin Alexander, 19; Brandy George, 28; Bionca Hickerson, 22; and Nekia Youngblood, 32, are charged with being accessories after the fact to attempted second-degree murder and obstruction of justice, according to a police news release.
At Thursday’s court appearance, Akein Scott, shackled and in an orange prison jumpsuit, stood calmly and silently as his court-appointed attorney handled the proceedings in the shooting case.
Prosecutors said a witness picked out a photo of Akein Scott from a lineup. An arrest affidavit said the unidentified witness told investigators that Akein Scott was the person seen in a surveillance video that police released to the public as they searched for him. The witness also said Akein Scott was carrying a silver and black semi-automatic handgun at the shooting scene, according to the affidavit.
Magistrate Judge Gerard Hansen set Akein Scott’s bond at $10 million — $500,000 on each of the 20 counts in the Mother’s Day shooting case.
Police had been searching for Akein Scott since identifying him as a suspect Monday from the surveillance video.
Courtney Moles, whose apartment overlooks the shooting site, said she didn’t feel her safety was in jeopardy while police searched the city.
“I didn’t really think he would come back. It’s more personal than that,” she said. “He wasn’t going to that second line to make national news. He was probably settling some kind of score.”
Edward Buckner, president of the Original Big 7 Social Aid and Pleasure Club, which sponsored Sunday’s parade, said he was overjoyed at the news of the arrests.
“I’m just ecstatic,” he said. “That’s the best thing that could ever have happened.”
Police publicized a $10,000 reward in the case, and investigators received several tips after images from the surveillance camera were released.
Gun violence has flared at two other city celebrations this year. Five people were wounded in a drive-by shooting in January after a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade, and four were wounded in a shooting after an argument in the French Quarter in the days leading up to Mardi Gras. Two teens were arrested in connection with the MLK Day shootings; three men were arrested and charged in the Mardi Gras shootings.

Areas of southern Louisiana are disappearing underwater at an alarming rate, and the state is paralyzed by politics and taking no steps to address the problem, according to a new report called Losing Ground.

The wetlands that protect southern Louisiana, including New Orleans, from flooding are disappearing.

Dramatic erosion and sinking land along the southeastern coast of Louisiana could lead to “the largest forced migration for environmental reasons in the history of the country,” a new report says.
According to the report, called Losing Ground, changes in the Mississippi delta that were designed to increase flood protection and enhance oil and gas production have led to an unprecedented loss of land.
Bob Marshall, a reporter with the New Orleans news site The Lens, has covered coastal land loss in Louisiana for decades. He collaborated with ProPublica to publish the new report. ProPublica used official US Geological Survey topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite photographs going back to before the 1930s and combined them to create a powerful visual representation of just how much land has been lost in the past 80 years.
Marshall says people who have been reading his stories for decades tell him, ‘This is the best thing you've ever done.’ “The words are pretty much the same,” he says, “but these graphics really hit home as you watch ... these pristine wetlands in the 1930’s turn, in some areas, to open water. You watch as these canals [come] in and the place just open[s] up and [falls] apart.”
Since the mid-1930s, the total amount of lost land is about 2,000 square miles, Marshall says. Today, Louisiana loses about 16 square miles a year. Twenty or 30 years ago, the rate of land loss was as high as 50 square miles a year.
All of this results from three processes that reinforce and amplify each other’s effects: levee construction, oil and gas exploration and sea level rise.
All of southern Louisiana, from Mississippi to Texas, was built by the Mississippi River, Marshall explains. The river’s delta-building process goes back 7,000 years, to the end of the last glacial period. “When the river hits the flat plain, it slows down and the sediment it's carrying begins to fall out,” Marshall says. It's not just the main stem of the river that deposits sediment: all the distributaries that “peel off the river on its deltaic plain” deposit various amounts and types of sediment also.
During the spring floods, the river and all its distributaries would overflow their banks and spread the sediment — “nature's cement,” Marshall calls it — across the entire delta.
This natural process was still happening when Europeans arrived. When New Orleans was founded in 1718, the river and its distributaries were still creating land out in the Gulf of Mexico, Marshall says. “Everything went along as nature intended it until we began developing along the river, and people began putting up levies so that they wouldn't get flooded by the river every spring,” Marshall says. Levees block the river from spreading additional sediment onto its delta. When a river can't replenish its delta, that delta begins to subside.
Levee building on the Mississippi dates to the 1850s, but after the Great Flood of 1927, when most of the Mississippi River Valley from Illinois to Louisiana was submerged, Congress ordered something more be done. The Army Corps of Engineers built the series of enormous levees we have today. “They put the river in a straitjacket, permanently blocking the river from getting back to its delta to replenish this land,” Marshall says.
If that's all we had done, Marshall says, the delta would have subsided at “an infinitesimal rate — milliliters per year — and the wetlands that were intact in the 1930s when these levees were finished would still be largely intact today." But that isn’t all we did.
As the corps was finishing the levees, oil and gas were discovered in the coastal zone, and companies moved in. At the time, there were no laws or regulations protecting wetlands. “Eventually 50,000 wells were permitted in the coastal zone,” Marshall says. “Over 10,000 miles of canals were dredged for oil and gas, 500 miles for shipping — and we basically eviscerated this incredible delta.”
Dozens of reports show the highest rate of land loss occurred in areas with the heaviest amount of oil and gas extraction and canal dredging, Marshall says. According to some studies, the oil and gas industry is responsible for anywhere between 36 to 60 percent of the loss.
“So we're fighting this massive loss of surface land [and] we're also subsiding because we're not replenishing these wetlands,” Marshall says. “On top of that, here comes global warming and sea level rise.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, southern Louisiana has “the highest rate of relative sea level rise of any place in the country, and one of the highest rates anywhere on the planet.”
Communities across the southern portion of Louisiana are now faced with having to move. “People are stunned and angry and they want someone to pay to keep their communities where they are — but the cost is just too high,” Marshall says.
One only needs to look at recent history, Marshall says, to see what the future could hold: Delacroix Island, a Spanish settlement about 30 miles from New Orleans, was founded in the late 1700s or early 1800s and survived into the late 1950s. “They had a subsistence lifestyle; they were fisherman, trappers; they picked Spanish moss to sell to furniture makers,” Marshall says.
When canal dredging started in the '30s and ‘40s, the wetlands around Delacroix began falling apart. The lagoons and the bayous widened; the lakes got bigger. “Eventually, the storms that came through made it impossible for them to live there full-time,” Marshall says. That whole culture is now gone.
Even after passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, oil and gas companies were never forced to comply with permits requiring that they restore land to its prior state after working it. Canals were never refilled; waste pits were not properly disposed of. In many cases, Marshall says, when wells ran dry, companies just abandoned the area without being held accountable for the damage.
A landmark lawsuit brought last year by the local flood protection authority is seeking compensation from 97 oil, gas and pipeline companies. But it has provoked the ire of the state’s political establishment. Governor Bobby Jindal promised to get the legislature to pass laws retroactively preventing the levee board from suing, and managed to get a bill passed. The law is being challenged in federal court.
Meanwhile, parts of Louisiana continue to disappear at the rate of about a football field an hour.
This story is based on an interview that aired on PRI's Living on Earth with Steve Curwood.

Trump Administration Signals It Would Seek Mostly Modest Changes to Nafta
March 30, 2017
One change would be in government-procurement section of deal that could open up door for ‘Buy American’ policies
WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is signaling to Congress it would seek mostly modest changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement in upcoming negotiations with Mexico and Canada, a deal President Donald Trump called a “disaster” during the campaign.
[Bob Davis & William Mauldin] March 29, 2017 [The Wall Street Journal]
According to an administration draft proposal being circulated in Congress by the U.S. trade representative’s office, the U.S. would keep some of Nafta’s most controversial provisions, including an arbitration panel that lets investors in the three nations circumvent local courts to resolve civil claims. Critics of these panels say they impinge on national sovereignty.
The draft, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, talks of seeking “to improve procedures to resolve disputes,” rather than eliminating the panels.
The U.S. also wouldn’t use the Nafta negotiations to deal with disputes over foreign currency policies or to hit numerical targets for bilateral trade deficits, as some trade hawks have been urging.
However, in one far-reaching change, the draft proposal calls for allowing a Nafta nation to reinstate tariffs in case of a flood of imports that cause “serious injury or threat of serious injury” to domestic industries.
The document appears to be a compromise between the desires of trade hawks to use Nafta renegotiations as a way to set a new trade agenda and moderates who back the U.S. traditional commitment to free trade. The Congress is split along those lines as well.
The draft could be revised. The administration must give Congress 90 days’ notice under trade law before beginning formal Nafta renegotiations. It is far from clear that Canada and Mexico would agree to the changes the U.S. seeks.
In a meeting last month with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Trump signaled that he wanted small changes in Nafta—at least as it pertains to Canada—but didn’t offer any details.
The U.S. trade representative’s office declined to comment.
Jeffrey Schott, a trade scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a free-trade think tank, said that the measure reimposing tariffs—called a “snapback” in trade lingo—was also sought by the Clinton administration 24 years ago when it negotiated side deals to Nafta. Mexico didn’t agree to the changes.
The letter accompanying the Nafta draft, which was sent to members of the Senate Finance Committee, among others, said the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico “demands that this administration take swift action to revise the relationship.”
But the draft doesn’t propose specific measures that would close the deficit. So-called rules of origin—the percentage of a product that must be produced in Nafta countries—could be set in a way that “supports production and jobs in the United States,” the draft said. But the document doesn’t provide any details of how that would be done or what level of domestic content the U.S. would seek.
Another substantial change could emerge in the government-procurement section of Nafta, which currently requires the U.S. government to consider bids from Mexican and Canadian companies on domestic infrastructure projects.
In the draft objectives, the Trump administration is seeking “to establish rules that require government procurement to be conducted in a manner that is consistent with U.S. law and the administration’s policy on domestic procurement preferences,” which could open up the door for Mr. Trump’s “Buy American” policies. Meanwhile, U.S. contractors could lose business in Mexico and Canada.
Mr. Schott noted that a number of the proposed negotiating objectives echo provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact among Pacific Rim countries. Mr. Trump campaigned heavily against the TPP. The president pulled the U.S. from the deal on his first working day in office.
Among the TPP-style provisions the U.S. will seek, according to the draft, are protections of digital trade and commerce, tougher intellectual property enforcement and requirements that state-owned companies operate in a commercial fashion. The Obama administration had hoped to use TPP to set standards for state-owned firms in the Pacific as a way to influence Chinese behavior.
The proposed labor and environmental provisions—particularly important to Democrats—also echo the TPP, said Mr. Schott. The U.S. would seek to include such provisions in the body of Nafta agreement—they are now in a side deal—and have them enforced in the same way that other Nafta requirements are enforced. Ultimately, that could mean imposing tariffs if the dispute isn’t worked out among the parties.
Many supporters of Mr. Trump’s approach to trade had hoped he would include binding currency rules in Nafta and use that as a template for deals with Asian countries.
Even if currency isn’t included in the main Nafta negotiations, U.S. officials could still strike a side-deal on currency with counterparts in Mexico. The Obama administration won new currency guidelines in a deal meant to accompany the TPP, but critics across Congress complained that the currency deal wasn’t binding, and lawmakers never brought the TPP to a vote.

Getting clean from Codeine, Alprazolam, alcohol or any other substance you or your loved one is addicted to takes an individualized treatment plan. Two options of drug or alcohol addiction treatment centers in Hickory can help you succeed: either Residential or Out-patient Rehabilitation. Residential treatment offers long-run gains with extended stays in a perfect rehabilitation facility. From-home plans may be "easier", but lack the stability and resources of two-month programs to get sober. Ultimately, the choice is yours, and we are here to help you find the one that's right for you.

Withdrawing yourself from the environment of the substance abuse can help get rid of distractions and temptations that prevent total recovery. When viewing rehab as a therapeutic retreat, addicts will find private executive clinics in cities outside of Hickory, Kentucky. Offering resort-like features, the highest-quality facilities help achieve a physical, mental and emotional recovery. However, those looking for outpatient treatments may find a program close to your home is an easier choice to make.

Luxury drug rehabs in Hickory, Kentucky will provide state-of-the-art treatment with upscale amenities for anyone requiring the very best drug treatment, just as Hickory alcohol rehab centers will help those battling alcoholism to achieve sobriety.

California Chamber releases list of ‘job killer’ bills | The Sacramento Bee
Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, made the list again with a bill to allow groups of independent contractors to organize as unions. The chamber says Assembly Bill 1727 harms consumers and the economy by allowing contractors “to collaborate and set prices for their services.” Gonzalez is one of the only lawmakers to routinely pass bills facing strong opposition from the chamber.
18 number of bills on California Chamber of Commerce’s ‘job killer’ list
Senate Bill 878 by Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, requires grocery stores, restaurants and retail stores to give employees a work schedule at least one week in advance. The chamber said the bill “eliminates worker flexibility and exposes employers to costly penalties, litigation, and government enforcement.”
The chamber said Assembly Bill 2162 from San Jose Democrat Kansen Chu to require a permit to cut down oak trees “erodes housing affordability” by increasing the cost and delays for housing projects.
Another bill, Assembly Constitutional Amendment 8, would give Californians the right to vote on a property tax increase to fund water projects. The bill was introduced by Assemblyman Richard Bloom, a Santa Monica Democrat who the Chamber helped defeat an incumbent to win his seat in 2012.
The chamber represents more than 13,000 companies and spent $4.3 million to lobby in California in 2015. The chamber expects to add more bills to the list in the next few weeks.
Editor’s Note: This post was updated at 9:48 a.m. March 30, 2016 to correct the author of Assembly Bill 2162 to Assemblyman Kansen Chu.

Newly Discovered Greenland Melting Could Accelerate Sea-Level Rise
Parts of the massive ice sheet once considered stable have been shown to be melting in new research

A large area of the Greenland ice sheet once considered stable is actually shedding massive amounts of ice, suggesting that future sea-level rise may be worse than expected, a team of scientists warned yesterday in a new study.
The research in Nature Climate Change signals that many climate models may be too conservative in their projections through this century, as they are not considering ice loss from the northeast portion of Greenland. The discovered ice loss in the northeast -- which has been largely overlooked to date -- is worrisome because the drainage basin there covers 16 percent of the ice sheet and holds the capability of funneling ice deep from Greenland's interior out to sea, the scientists said.
"This is an area we should be worried about because it's huge. Who knows, maybe this is starting something very big," said Shfaqat Khan, senior researcher at Technical University of Denmark, and the lead author of the study. The ice loss found in northeast Greenland is accelerating, and it is uncertain how many years it will continue, he said.
Regional warming has triggered newly discovered ice melting in a large portion of northeastern Greenland. The area, marked NEGIS, covers about 16 percent of the island's thick ice sheet. (Most-rapid melting is indicated in red.)

The scientists reported that northeast Greenland was stable -- with a zero ice mass loss -- until about 2003, when summer temperatures spiked. The northeast was considered the last remaining stable part of the ice sheet, according to the researchers. Within a few years, the main outlet glacier draining the region -- Zachariae Isstrom -- retreated about 20 kilometers, and regional ice mass loss jumped from zero to roughly 10 metric gigatons a year. "That is huge," Khan said.
Ice loss from northeast Greenland into the Fram Strait abutting the Arctic Ocean is now closer to 15 to 20 metric gigatons a year and is still increasing, said Khan.
In comparison, it took the Jakobshavn Isbræ ice stream -- a southwest Greenland region with a fast-moving glacier that has been a focal point of scientific examination of ice sheet melt -- 150 years to retreat 35 kilometers, said Khan. "We haven't seen something like this anywhere else," Khan said about the northeast.
He predicted northeast Greenland would overtake the Jakobshavn ice stream within a few years as Greenland's largest contributor to sea-level rise. The Zachariae ice stream is about twice the size of Jakobshavn, extending some 373 miles into the interior.
Climate models may understate risks
Previously, many scientists had believed that northeast Greenland was too cold to be a significant contributor to ice loss, said Khan. With so much focus on Jakobshavn and the northwest, there was less attention to the northeast, said study co-author Michael Bevis, a professor at Ohio State University.
Sea-level rise estimates through the end of the century range widely, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggesting a possible number below 1 foot to around 3 feet, while other scientists suggest it could be higher than 3 feet. The ultimate result could make a huge difference with storm surge and flooding in coastal states like North Carolina.
Over the past 20 years, Greenland melt contributed about 16 percent of the global total of sea-level rise annually, according to the study. Thermal expansion of water, glacier and Antarctica ice melt, and aquifer changes on land drove most of the rest.
Considering that existing climate models typically do not consider northeast Greenland with future sea-level projections, the findings suggest that sea-level rise estimates may err on the high side, close to 3 feet or higher, said Khan.
There remains a high level of uncertainty, because of unknowns and cyclical dynamics with future air and water temperature, said Bevis. Ocean currents bringing unusually warm water, for instance, could shift away more from Greenland, or move in closer, he said.
Greenland's ice streams drain the ice sheet via meltwater runoff much in the same way that water basins drain rivers, explained Bevis. For years, floating ice in the bay abutting the ice sheet in the northeast acted as a barrier to ice loss. The ice pack of loose debris used to be year-round, making it previously "hard for glacier to push its way through that," he said.
With significant warming in the past decade, there was significant melt from the ice sheet. Further, the floating bay ice decreased, allowing easier flow from the ice sheet into the water.
Additionally, the Zachariae glacier at the ice sheet margin began its retreat and moved into deeper water, which exacerbated the melt, said Bevis. Water touching the glacier got warmer, and "there was more interface between the water and the ice," said Bevis. The paper notes that ocean warming around Greenland may be almost double the global mean by 2100.
Exact numbers are a work in progress
The scientists used a combination of surface elevation data from satellites and planes between 1978 and 2012 and a GPS network that weighs the ice sheet like a scale, according to Ohio State. The Greenland GPS Network, or GNET, utilizes more than 50 stations on the ice sheet coast to detect ice loss.
Ice experts not involved in the research offered mix reviews.
Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University, said it is an "interesting paper" that shows that thinning has started in a region thought resistant, in response to warming that is much smaller than what is projected for the future. It suggests that a small temperature change helped trigger a notable ice loss.
Yet Ian Joughin, a scientist at University of Washington, said he is skeptical of the result. He said it's not impossible that northeast Greenland is losing that much ice, but he would be surprised if the numbers hold up with additional research.
The speed of the glacier doesn't seem to match the measurements from surface elevation and GPS data, said Joughin. He said he suspects the researchers "overextrapolated" some of the data, although it was clear that there was some real change going on in the northeast. However, data from that region are really sparse for the studied period, he said.
However, the big picture for Greenland is clear, in that warming melts ice, said Alley. There is good evidence throughout history that the Greenland ice sheet has shrunk with warming to raise sea levels, but putting precise numbers on how much and how fast is a work in progress, he said.
He said the new paper highlights many things that are still not well-known to scientists, such as extensive information about water temperature reaching the grounding line of the outlets of the northeast Greenland ice stream, where water is probably most influential with melt.
"The paper still doesn't lead to 'Run for the hills!' sea-level rise, but it may lean toward the high side of the IPCC projections. ... [T]here is work to do to really nail down the numbers," said Alley.

I’m absolutely terrified to tell my kids about my mental illness

When I watched Sam Jones’ interview with Kristen Bell, it struck a massive chord with me. The Frozen star reveals that she suffers from anxiety and depression and that at the age of 18 her mom sat her down and told her there’s a serotonin imbalance in her family line. The actress expressed how grateful she is for the “open and honest dialogue with her mom” that came from that, and it got me thinking about my own situation.
Sometime soon, I will need to talk to my kids about my mental illness. I just don’t know how to go about it.
More: 34 songs about motherhood because just one will never be enough
Honesty is a big thing in our house. I encourage my kids to tell me everything, no matter what. I know how secrets and lies can tear a family apart and foster long-term resentments that are difficult to overcome.
And it goes both ways. I’m honest with them too. I don’t sugarcoat the truth. I keep it age-appropriate, but they know the world’s not always a shiny happy place. But they do think they have a shiny happy mama, and the time is coming for me to tell them the truth.
Because while I’m open and honest about death and religion and where babies come from, I’ve been lying to them for a long time about something that’s a huge part of my life — and therefore by association a huge part of theirs.
Unfortunately, my monthly prescription from my doctor has never come with the handy guide, “How to Tell Your Kids You Have Depression (and Not Completely Freak Them Out).”
Juggling depression and kids can be incredibly difficult. What do you do when you can’t get out of bed in the morning because the mere thought of lifting your head from the pillow makes you sob, but you have two children waiting for you to make breakfast and get them dressed and deposit them safely at the school gate? Over the last few years, since my kids were old enough to ask, “What’s wrong with you, Mummy?” I’ve fabricated headaches, sore throats and upset stomachs. Thanks to my medication and my ongoing dedication to self-care, really bad episodes of depression have been kept to a minimum. But anyone with the illness will know that sometimes that black-hearted bitch can just swoop in out of nowhere and floor you with one strike.
My daughter is not quite 6, so she’s too young to get any sort of handle on what it means to be mentally ill. But my son is 9 this year, and I think the time is coming for me to reveal my secret to him. I don’t suffer from headaches. I don’t get upset stomachs. I haven’t had sore throats. I have depression, which is something far more serious.
The problem is, I have reasons for not telling my children about my mental illness, and I only need to run through these in my head to put off having the Big Talk.
I don’t want them to worry about me. I worry about everything. Worrying sucks. It affects every part of your life and can destroy relationships. With so much in this world to worry about, I don’t want to add to the list.
I don’t want them to be embarrassed. Even though this is 2016, some people in this world still have 1950s attitudes towards mental health. I have people in my own life who don’t think depression is a “real” illness. The last thing I want is for my kids to be teased on the playground because their mother is batshit crazy.
I don’t want them to grow up too quickly. I can be honest with my children about some of the injustices and atrocities in the world, but I feel like I can still protect them from those things. As soon as I tell them I have depression, it’s out there, it’s in our home and it’s on their shoulders as well as mine.
More: Everything I wish I could say to my anonymous egg donor
But more than any of that, I don’t want them to be confused, or to jump to the wrong conclusions or to grow up resenting me, which are all possibilities if I continue to keep them in the dark.
When the time comes, I’ll tell them that depression is an illness that causes someone’s brain to work in a different way from someone who doesn’t have depression. I’ll tell them it isn’t a weakness. I’ll tell them that it affects people in many different ways. I’ll tell them that it can be managed with lots of different types of treatment. I’ll tell them that it has nothing to do with them, and it is not their job to make me better.
Most importantly, I’ll tell them to keep talking to me, to keep asking me questions, whether about depression or anything else they don’t understand, because nothing they could ever say will make me ill. And that we all need to look after our mental health by talking about how we feel and asking for help with our problems.
It’s going to be the most difficult conversation of my life, but I’m hoping it will be a positive one — an opportunity to teach them one of life’s most important lessons: that everyone has problems, and it doesn’t matter so much what those problems are, but how they are handled.

Ultimately, I hope they will see me as an example of how to face challenges with honesty and courage, and how to persevere despite adversity.

A record-breaking harvest from the Kwinana zone has pushed CBH Group's state-wide grain receivals to near record levels.
In December CBH confirmed the Kwinana zone, which covers Wheatbelt farms near Perth, has broken its record after surpassing 7.7 million tonnes of grain received.

The final harvest report on Friday confirmed the Kwinana zone had received nearly 8 million tonnes of grain, helping bump state-wide receivals up to 16 million tonnes.
The state-wide record of 16.6 million tonnes was set in 2016/17.

CBH acting general manager operations Ben Raisbeck said after a drawn-out harvest, which saw several ups and downs, it was shaping up to be one of the biggest seasons in recent years.
“I want to thank all our staff on site who have worked hard over the past couple of months, often under pressure to get the loads through efficiently,” he said.
“CBH Operations will now be focused on moving grain from site to port to fulfil the demanding shipping requirements that we have in this early new year."
The Kwinana harvest zone received 220,000 tonnes over the Christmas/New Year period.
Kwinana Zone Assistant Manager, Allan Walker said the majority of sites were now closed for the season.
"Only a few of the larger sites (remain) open to receive the remainder of the crop which we expect to be completed over the next ten days," he said.

Stereophile: the Next Generation
Stereophile Staff | Mar 1, 2019
Today, Stereophile announces its first major Editorial changes in decades, with an expansion of the Editorial team and a change in leadership.
Since 1986, through many generations of corporate ownership, John Atkinson (right, above) has been the Editor and bedrock of the magazine. After nearly 331/3 years, JA has decided to relinquish daily responsibility for producing the magazine and as of April 1 will take on a new (and newly established) position: Technical Editor. Stepping into his shoes as Editor will be long-time Stereophile contributor Jim Austin (left, above). Deputy Editor Art Dudley will continue to do what he does best (and what he prefers to do): writing columns and reviews and editing the prose of Stereophile's other contributors, while managing an expanded suite of responsibilities. Richard Lehnert, who began his association with Stereophile in 1984 as our long-time Copy Editor and was the magazine's Music Editor 19871996, has also chosen this time to retire from the magazine that bears the stamp of his influence; Lehnert will be replaced by a new copyeditor, Linda Felaco. These changes will be effective as of the July issue of Stereophile.
"I'm deeply honored to become only the third Editor in Stereophile's distinguished history," says Austin, who has been writing for Stereophile for some 15 years. "It's a major responsibility to follow in the footsteps of audio legends like J. Gordon Holt and John Atkinson, and to hold the reins of the world's most important high-end audio magazine. It's an opportunity I relish, though. It's hard to even imagine a job I'd enjoy more."
As a teenager, Jim spent many hours at the Sound Shack, the audio boutique in his home town of Ft. Pierce, Florida. That's where he bought his first serious pair of loudspeakers, Polk Audio Model 7Bs, which he paired with a succession of Japanese receivers and Technics turntables. Later, he earned a PhD in physics and worked for a while as a research scientist, applying methods from nuclear physics to study of semiconductors and other materials. "It was nothing to do with music," Austin says, "but I was an experimental physicist and I learned a lot about electronics and craft." Still later he became an Editor at Science magazine, where he worked for 14 years, rising to the rank of Senior Editor while contributing to Stereophile on the side.
Despite the change in leadership, major editorial changes are not envisioned at the magazine. "Stereophile is a successful magazine," Jim says, "which is remarkable when you consider all the titles that folded or today exist only online. I intend to look for opportunities to make Stereophile better: more engaging, more relevant, more entertaining, with the best, most insightful writing about music and audio.
"My main objective, though, is to steer a steady courseto keep Stereophile pointed in the direction it has been pointed in for decades. In particular, Stereophile has always been a subjectivist audio journal. Its main concern has always been with how music sounds through the equipment we review and how it affects us, the listeners. But for 30 years Stereophile has been built upon the edifice of John Atkinson's measurements, which examine whether the components we review are thoughtfully and solidly engineered. Under my watch, we'll continue to do both those things, with, I hope, renewed vigor."
John Atkinson adds: At last fall's Rocky Mountain Audio Fest I asked a young Stereophile reader how he had discovered us. "I started reading my Dad's copy," he explained. "He used to read you in Hi-Fi News magazine in the 1980s."
I blanched. But yes, approaching 71 years old, I am long in the tooth. The June issue of Stereophile will be my 390th and though my hearing is still good, I decided it was time to hand the reins over to a new and, more importantly, a younger man.
As Jim noted, I will still be on Stereophile's masthead as Technical Editor. But having worked with Jim for the past 15 years, I know as Editor he will succeed in taking J. Gordon Holt's and my magazine to even greater heights. You have the conn, Jim.

I'm happy for Jim and all concerned.
You could/might/should write a genuine letter to the Auto Companys explaining why advertising in Stereophile is a good idea, they'll love hearing from the Editor himself. ( they're proud as hell of their Audio Systems )

"Wanted, new Editor for Stereophile magazine. We like to promote from within. Applicant must have 10 years + experience in audiophile writing and reviewing, have records he is willing to die for, and have the initials "JA" so we do not incur any added expense in changing the typeset initials "JA" as a way of referring to our Editor. All qualified applicants with the initials "JA" are encouraged to apply!"

I find this interesting. First, let me congratulate both men - JA, I was 9 years old when you took over and you arguably shaped many of my current beliefs about sound and many of my considerable spending decisions through the years; and JA2, whose conclusions I haven't always shared, but whose articles I have always read from beginning to end with interest. I've viewed JA's "quant" a welcome counter to the pages of "qual", which has always been Stereophile's yin to TAS's yang. In this regard JA2's appointment is a continuation of something that I have always regarded as a quality that made Stereophile the absolute best... "TAB". I have hired many people that I feel counter the norm, or my own personal beliefs, on the hope they'd create a diversity of thought that hedge the downside risk of groupthink and hivemind; in that regard I think this change ensures Stereophile's relevance for years to come, albeit with some turnover in staff given what I suspect is a strong personality. I say this in a positive sense. I don't know JA2, but my inference from his articles and comments is that he will kick the tires at every turn! Congratulations to both of you!

Had I not disposed of my vinyl collection and STD/Hadcock/Nytech set-up back in 1983 to go to university, I would have trod an audio career path. Schmuck that I am, now I'm re-buying it all again.

You're joking. The magazine has it already. It's called the measurements section of the review. Keep Stereophile exactly as it is. This is not Scientific American. It is art and magic and it cannot be explained with measurements or algorithms. If you can't accept that by now after 50 years of Stereophile and TAS, you're in the wrong hobby.

"Double Blind Tests" PROVE that all vodkas taste the same and that a Stradivarius is indistinguishable from a student violin. Actually those stupid results prove double blind tests though useful for many things are often not. And then as I found out when challenged to a double blind amplifier test that didn't go the way the test designer wished (to prove all amps that measure the same are sonically indistinguishable), excuses are made and "outlier" results (like when I got all identifications correct) get tossed.

Submitted by Anton on March 4, 2019 - 12:13pm
I love DBT (usually SBT and I get to play with the volume) but I know what you mean.
I have an acquaintance who did the "Brita" challenge at a science meeting neurology conference with a good vodka compared to cheap vodka that had been filtered through a Brita. There were six different Brita samples, corresponding to "one filtration," "two filtrations," etc.
He nailed the good vodka, the cheap vodka, and identified each filter sample by how many times it had been filtered.
Amazing.
Getting the test criteria straight would help with other DBT.
At some point, someone skilled enough should be able to rise above the terrible deafness caused by DBT and be able to tell things apart, like you did with the amps!
Also, what's true for an amp driving a complex thing like a speaker may not apply to other things, like fuses, "wires," etc. Still lots to flesh out!
I was just perusing the Hi Fi News site and they actually published measurements of wires, fascinating!
As a reader, I would love to see JCA (technical editor) compare and contrast an array of findings with these more subtle devices.
Both sides of the "makes a difference / no it doesn't" crowd need to find some room for common discussion.
Transparent measurements, listening trials, all part of the fun.
Our local club does blind comparisons and nobody gets butt hurt about challenging our listening skills.
In a recent club challenge, a plain over the counter fuse won the day vs. fuses costing up to 120 bucks per fuse! So, it seemed we had the ability to hear what was up, but the challenge was won by the little guy.
We did the same thing with passive preamps at a THE Show and a 400 dollar unit KILLED the 15,000 dollar and 2,000 dollar competition. (This was on a fancy system with King's Audio electrostats, etc.)
It's like when the 6 dollar bottle of wine beats the 120 dollar bottle, good for us!
I digress...instead of feeling threatened by DBT (actually, SBT and not instantaneous would be fine,) we should start the party and see how golden our ears really are.
Man, in the realm of measurements, how about comparing the differences between "broken in" and not for equipment, and see what may change!
Everyone is so afraid of being wrong, or having their perceptions "judged" that we poo poo a very fun thing!
In wine competitions, tasting is done blind and we get feedback on our perceptions, for better or worse. Hi Fi should be able to emulate that and see what happens.

Are the "useful" ones those with whose outcomes you agree and the "stupid" ones those with whose outcomes you disagree?
A given test doesn't prove that all vodkas taste the same.
It does demonstrate that a particular group of tasters could not reliably distinguish among the particular group of samples they tasted. If you're open-minded, you might consider conducting your own blind taste test to see if you reach the same conclusion, or not.
Likewise, outlier results shouldn't be tossed out of hand.
Rather, the test should be repeated to determine if those results can be confirmed.

I've been reading Stereophile since right before the digest to large format switch over and I have always loved it. Of course, back in those days, getting your CD player and a simple DAC figured out was a priority for me, anyway. By my calculations, that's right after your (JA) takeover, so I'm pretty accustomed to your editorial style. While I do miss the old cast of characters (J10, Corey, Sam and the late Mr. Reina), I'm sure with JA2 in the drivers seat, the course will stay true. Thanks for the great ride, so far.

I had a Vinyl Audio Shop which failed when 33.3 died. My Sales continued because the Monster Cable Accessories Full Line sold quite well. I've subsequently discovered that P&A ( parts & accessories ) are the most profitable part of Businesses like mine. So, especially today, a Line ( Range if you're Brit. ) of eBay garments and accessories could be viable and exciting.
You might be in an ideal position to be Stereophile's Official OEM for all such items. You Could do Swiss Army Knives with Silver Inlayed Logos, Embroidered Hats, Silk Screened shirts and all manner of other desirable Desk Top trinket items. Your Local Speciality Sales Co. can and will provide endless useful suggestions. It could be a great business for you, you'd even be able to supply a wide range of Audio Manufacturers with High Quality Products and fulfillment.

I was referring to my Vinyl Business in the 1980s not You and your acquaintances.
The Audio Business continued, Redbook replaced 33.3, the Automotive Market bloomed into the Dominant Component of the 2 Channel Audio Industry with Billions of Dollars in Sales ( hidden in the New Car Window Sticker). The Movie Industry migrated from Magnetic Tape to 5.1 & 7.1 etc.
I attempt to be fair in saying it isn't 33.3 Vinyl's fault that it's number of proponents has tapered off to a very few committed & dedicated collectors.
Vinyl's largest problems are:
1). Prohibitively High Price of admission. ( New Playback Gear is Pricy )
and
2). Millennials ( the next generation of audiophiles ) are struggling with Tuition Debt as they complete their Diplomaed Education. They no longer have disposable income for Pricy Vinyl Audio gear in addition to the Digital Gear they are already able to access.
Vinyl's smaller problems include :
3). The amount of Support Gear needed
and
4). The Volume of Cubic Footage needed for the Record Storage Systems. ( what family is tolerant of the Vinyl Audiophile's 10,000 Record Collection.?)
So, you see, Vinyl has problems.
The Remaining 75,000 or so Vinyl playing people might be HighEnd Audio's smallest Minority, while Chad Kassem remains their Wonderful Higher Authority.
Where would Vinyl be without Chad breathing life into it?

What is your definition of ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:50pm
... "pricy" (or pricey) in regard to vinyl playback gear?
The first turntable and cartridge I bought (a few years before the introduction of CDs) would cost the equivalent of about $1,000 as adjusted for inflation.
At that price level, today, you can buy decent turntables from Audio-Technica, Pioneer, Pro-Ject and Rega, along with a moving-magnet cartridge from Audio-Technica, Nagaoka or Ortofon.
Or, for that same amount you could buy a complete system.
For example, an Audio-Technica AT-LP5 turntable (with cartridge included), plus a Yamaha R-N303 receiver (which also has a DAC and a network interface for streaming) and a pair of ELAC Debut 2.0 bookshelf speakers.
Such a system ought to be sufficient to tide over most millennials until they are able to afford something significantly more expensive.

Definition of Pricy:
Submitted by tonykaz on March 5, 2019 - 3:04pm
Vinyl playback is an extraordinarily pricy Hobby by comparison!
I'm talking HighEnd.
A VPI Avenger ( Comic Book Name? ) begins around $30,000! VPI is the finest turntable line I ever represented.
Arm price around $10,000
Phono Cart around $10,000 ( I'd think KOETSU )
Special Cables $ ?
Phono RIAA pre-amp $10,000 - up
A suitable stand for the Player $500 +
Vinyl record cleaning systems $ 500 +
Vinyl Record Storage Systems for 10,000 Records and the square footage to house them $100 per sq.ft. for 10 x 10 Room = $10,000
Buying Audiophile Vinyl $30/$50 each
A Vinyl System compared to a PS Audio DAC $5,000 playing Acoustic Sounds DSD downloads is far less expensive and far easier to maintain.
Committed Collectors, like the Vinyl Junkie, have lifetime collections to maintain.
New Millennials, starting fresh, may be vinyl curious but Digital presents a far wider mainstream Access to Glorious Music reproduction throughout 21st Century Life Environs.
There is a difference between Vinyl and the various Designers DACs: CHORD, PS Audio's Direct Stream, Schiit's Multibit, MSB's Analog DAC, etc. but the difference is small and the price differential is huge.
Price differential aside, Digital is an elegant solution to a complex problem.

You guys keep inspiring (feeding) me!

How about t-shirts with a reviewer's face on it under which would be inscribed a witty two- or three-word catchphrase we might expect that reviewer to say.
Examples:
Michael Fremer's face with "Digital sucks!", or
John Atkinson's face with "Analyze this!"
And that's it folks! I've been silly long enough (spring fever baby!). Thank you all for your tips and ideas. Should anything come of them in a retail sense, I promise you all free merch (limit one item per person).

Thanks, Ortofan,
Submitted by rschryer on March 6, 2019 - 9:17am
I enjoyed that video. And I do believe what Paul is saying.
However, as far as my own experience is concerned, when it comes to mid-priced equipment — the category of equipment I can afford — rather than the megabuck stuff, I feel more inner peace and long term satisfaction listening to a vinyl setup than I do a digital one, regardless of whether the former may exhibit more measurable distortion than the latter.
As good as mid-priced digital can be, from what I've heard (and there's a lot out there I haven't heard, especially when it comes to the latest generation of DACs), I still hear a blueish-grayish tint of mechanical artificiality that overlays the music, an effect that keeps me from becoming completely engaged in the music.
The mid-priced LP setup has other problems, but I still find that it sounds more natural overall than does its digital counterpart.
As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)

mid-priced vinyl rigs do sound better than their megalomaniac counterparts due to inevitable format limitations; nothing really special about megabuck digital either since digital holds no big secrets anyway. Delusions of grandeur might be a function of big money amongst others but good sound thankfully not.

"As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)"
I know it's said with a smiley-face, but I've always found it rather strange that "megabuck" price gets attached to "killer" sound quality.
Let's be honest that of course companies want (perhaps even need) this association to be made. However, I think audiophiles are recognizing that this is often not the case at all.

I meant killer in the sense...
Submitted by rschryer on March 8, 2019 - 10:31am
...of the cream of the crop, which, like anything else in life, comes at a premium.
This doesn't mean that all digital attached to a hefty price tag is going to be killer, and I wholeheartedly agree that there's some great-sounding digital out there that doesn't require mortgaging your house to own. But there's also a reason why Michael Fremer and Jason Victor Serinus bought uber-expensive gear from DCS rather than the $2500.00 offerings from Benchmark or Schitt, as good as the latter companies' goods are. Why else would these professional audio reviewers and lifelong music lovers choose to pay the big bucks?
I haven't heard DCS gear, but I trust MF's and JVS's hearing and their buying decisions.
That's the kind of "killer" I was referring to.

As someone who began reading Stereophile just before the transition from JGH to JA, I have experienced almost the whole range of John Atkinson's editorship (a short lapse during child rearing years). I have appreciated his deft hand on the tiller of Stereophile. I can only hope Jim Austin has as much success during his tenure.
Also since I began reading Stereophile in the first year of my career, I can't begrudge John the chance to step back as I will have been retired for 3 years in June.

Jim Austin. And thank heavens for that. I was recently contemplating that Atkinson must be getting ready to hand over the reigns, and was worried what with the amount of copy he seems to get these days that the successor was going to be named JVS. Don't get me wrong. JVS is a very good writer, but cut him back a little or the magazine will become the JVS Journal.

Henry Corsi Sr., a 91-year-old Valhalla Army veteran talks about the Nuremberg trials for Nazi war criminals. (Video by Mark Vergari/lohud)
Even people who say they were just "following orders" bear responsibility for evil acts ordered by people in power.
File - (AP) Nuremberg trial - Defendants of general trial. From left to right: field-marshall Freiher Maimilian von Weichs, Lothar Rendulic, colonel-general Ernst Dehner, general of infantry, and Ernst von Leyser, general of infantry.(Photo: (AP-Photo))
Story Highlights
Dean Balaes is a dual degree student attending both Vanderbilt Divinity School and Law School.
CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE
“I was only following orders,” is a common defense used by many to duck responsibility.
Especially in large organizations, we tend to blame others before taking inventory of ourselves.
The benefit to the blame-shifter is clear: if someone else is the problem, the blame-shifter can avoid ever needing to change.
In order to avoid moral namelessness of the blame-shifter, do we have to expand our notions of moral responsibility to more effectively appropriate the consequences of our actions?
'I was only following orders'
One common example of blame-shifting responsibility happens in the roles we fill on behalf of large organizations.
While serving our respective roles, we tend to view the actions we perform as separate from what we would do in our individual capacity. As such, the roles we fill set the outer boundaries for our moral agency.
For example, individuals acting in the role of train operator may believe they were morally blameless because their role only involved the transportation of Jews to the camps.
After all, their role is only transportation. They bring people from point A to point B. It’s not the train operators’ role to know more than what is required of them. Thus, what happens in the death camps is not their concern.
Eventually, train operators may recognize their culpability and try to shift responsibility to higher-ups. As the old excuse goes, “I was only following orders.”
But, how bad does the smell have to get before the train operator questions his role?

In response, the higher-ups may argue that they were only tasked with overseeing the bigger picture. Thus, the greater the distance from the ultimate perpetrators, the less responsibility the supervisor holds.
Some further excuses usually go along the lines of: “My subordinate took matters into his own hands,” “I should not be held responsible for acts I did not commit,” or “I could not possibly have known everything that goes on under my watch.”
Are these distance defenses believable? It’s like 2008 financial CEOs saying: “I had no idea my subordinates were packaging and selling insecure mortgages to the American people.”
To minimize the desirability of blame-shifting, one solution may be to expand responsibility. The idea is that responsible officers should be accountable for what happens all the way down the chain of command, just as subordinates are responsible for carrying out their policy orders.

Expanding responsibility to hold individuals accountable
One famous example of this expansion occurred during the Second World War. Japanese General Tomoyuki Yamashita was hanged for the crimes of his troops, who raped and slaughtered their way through the Philippines.
The War Crimes Tribunal attached liability to Yamashita based on his sweeping order to “do what is necessary” to quell insurrections. Or in the words of Henry II, “Would no one rid me of this troublesome priest?”
Supervisors who send well-intentioned orders down the chain of command do not interpret and commit the acts of their subordinates.
In a symbolic move, however, the Tribunal defied moral norms and expanded responsibility. Even though he had no knowledge of his subordinates’ crimes, Yamashita’s distance from the ultimate perpetrators did not liberate him from responsibility.

In its wisdom, the Tribunal understood that the buck stopped with Yamashita.
Yamashita shows that distance defenses should not save supervisors from being held accountable for crimes of their subordinates’ actions. And, at the same time, subordinates who are “just following orders” can be impressed with the reality that mindlessly following orders does not liberate them from responsibility.
In the context of the 2008 financial crisis, it’s widely acknowledged that corporate executives knew about the dangers of directing their subordinates to make and sell subprime mortgages. Greed brought our country’s economy to its knees, yet only one corporate executive was found responsible.
If morality is the source of the law, perhaps it’s time to expand our moral notions of responsibility to more effectively hold individuals accountable.

Observer Staffer Under Review (It’s a Good Thing)
by Forrest Wilder
Thu, Aug 29, 2013 at 10:31 am CST
At the risk of indulging a bit of log-rolling, we wanted to draw some attention to sometime-contributor (and Fifty Years of the Texas Observer editor) Char Miller’s new review of Observer managing editor Brad Tyer’s recently published book, Opportunity, Montana: Big Copper, Bad Water, and the Burial of an American Landscape, an examination of industrial degradation, landscape restoration and environmental justice in Big Sky Country.
In bringing to life this “buried history of Americans’ attachment to progress and estrangement from consequences,” Tyer makes it clear that the “slow death of Opportunity is Missoula’s cost of living,” an unequal power dynamic that has been applied as well to communities surrounding other Superfund sites, among them California’s Stringfellow Acid Pits, Tar Creek, Oklahoma, and New York’s Love Canal.
Miller, formerly of Trinity University in San Antonio, and author of a shelf of books about water issues and environmental science, including the recent On the Edge: Water, Immigration, and Politics in the Southwest, is currently chair of the Environmental Analysis Department at Pomona College in California.
Check out the entire review here.

Simpsons' secret is eternal youth
By Penelope Debelle

No other television series in entertainment history has equalled The Simpson's ability to mine an apparently endless vein of congenial satire that exists outside fashion or time. Every other hit TV comedy, from Cheers to Seinfeld to Friends, had its time but at last the characters and the actors flagged.
Writer Mike Reiss, who has been with The Simpsons for 18 years, says its extraordinary lifespan relies on Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie staying forever young and fresh.
"Our cast doesn't age," Reiss said in Adelaide where he was a guest lecturer at the Adelaide Film Festival at the weekend. "If it was a real show Bart would be 28 years old now and Maggie would be 19 and she'd be in college."

According to Reiss, Australia loves The Simpsons more than America does. At home, it is just another show. But in Australia, as in Canada, Britain and Ireland, it is treasured at a level Americans seem not to understand. "They like it in America but they don't love it," says Reiss. "I don't know if they even get it."
Reiss says this is partly because Americans are not good at laughing at themselves and part of the sport of The Simpsons is to laugh at Homer, who is lovable, fat and stupid. Reiss says Australia's least favourite Simpsons episode involved the family coming to Australia, letting loose a plague of cane toads and fleeing the country with a feral koala hanging on to the aircraft's wheels. "Whenever we have the Simpsons visit another country, that country gets furious, including Australia," says Reiss. "We were condemned in the Australian Parliament after the episode."
Reiss, who started out in Hollywood writing lines for Alf the alien puppet, says the show began with eight writers but now has 25 who work office hours and are not burnt out by the 80-hour weeks others demand. Reiss goes into the office only on Wednesdays, supplying one or two lines for each show. Among his contributions is the memorable punchline for a Homer song, "I'd rather have a beer/Than be father of the year".
"The show is run collectively, it's like a kibbutz," says Reiss. "Someone will write the whole show but then it's re-written a line at a time by 10 people sitting around a table asking if it can be better."
There has been no shortage of Hollywood stars wanting to appear on the show. The strangest was Michael Jackson, who made an uncredited appearance as the large, white mental patient, Leon Kompowsky. In the episode, Kompowsky thought he was Michael Jackson and talked and sang a birthday song for Lisa in Jackson's falsetto voice. The joke was that the character's voice was Jackson's, whose name was not in the credits; he wrote Lisa's song, spoke the lines but did not sing.
"You can guess with Michael Jackson it was a strange week," says Reiss. "He did his own acting but he brought in his authorised sound-alike to do the singing; this little white guy singing Michael Jackson songs with Michael sitting next to him laughing. To this day, we don't know why he did that."
The next leap for the writers will be The Simpsons Movie due for release in July this year. Reiss cannot discuss it beyond saying the writers resisted for more than a decade but succumbed because market research showed it was the single most requested film. Reiss says they were very conscious of the need to provide something worthy of The Simpsons brand. "I think if at any point we thought we hadn't given people something they can't get for free three times a day on TV, we would have stopped the movie."

Four presidents who retreated to Virginia
President Herbert and Lou Hoover take in the view from their home in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

By: Glenda C. Booth
U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was a gregarious, swashbuckling outdoorsman who hunted elephants in Africa and bears in Colorado. He came from wealth and owned a 23-room mansion, Sagamore Hill, on Long Island’s Oyster Bay.
But when Teddy and wife, Edith, wanted to relax, they traveled four hours south of Washington to a plain little wood-frame cabin in Virginia’s woodlands called Pine Knot.
There they indulged in solitude and studied the “little forest folk,” as the president called the wildlife. Postal officials added a car to the mail train, and the Roosevelts disembarked at a dot on the map called North Garden.
Once in office, most U.S. presidents soon feel compelled to escape Washington’s pressure cooker and the oppressive summer heat.
President Donald Trump has his private club getaways in Florida and New Jersey. Richard Nixon lolled around on Bebe Rebozo’s houseboat in Key Biscayne, Florida. Franklin Roosevelt opted for Canada’s Campobello Island and, after being struck by polio, a cottage at Georgia’s Warm Springs.
But four presidents chose rural Virginia for their private retreats. Three of these sites are open to the public today.
Pine Knot
In 1905, Edith Roosevelt bought an unpretentious, rustic cottage on 90 forested acres for $250 in Albemarle County “for rest and repair for the President.”
“The Tsar and Tsarina would have found it somewhat confining since it consisted of one rough-cut, stone-chimneyed boarded box, with two smaller boxes upstairs,” she wrote, describing the first-floor lodge-type room and small bedrooms. “The pitched roof was overlong in front, creating a shaded ‘piazza’ at mosquito level.”
Of course, the Roosevelts could retreat to Sagamore Hill as well, but Edith said her husband needed wilderness, since at Sagamore Hill the White House in effect went with them.
Throngs of cabinet members, legislators, ambassadors, potentates, envoys, generals, industrialists, labor leaders, writers, historians, architects, artists, naturalists and others descended on the home, and telephone and telegraph lines linked it at all times with Washington.
Not so at Pine Knot. The house had no electricity, heating, insulation, telephone or indoor plumbing. The President’s chief domestic chore was to “empty the slops.” (He did not know that Edith had the Secret Service patrolling the woods.)
After exiting the train, Roosevelt did not read a memo, choosing to listen to the critters over the chatter of government big wigs.
He unwound by watching birds from the porch, one day identifying 75 species by their call. He also may have had one of the last sightings of the nearly extinct passenger pigeon in 1908.
He wrote his son Kermit in 1906 that he left the cabin under a brilliant moon for hunting and, after 13 hours in the woods, got one turkey, “a beautiful side shot at about 35 yards.”
In another letter to Kermit he said, “It is really a perfectly delightful little place; the nicest little place of the kind you can imagine. Mother is a great deal more pleased with it than any children with any toy I ever saw.”
Other than family, the Roosevelts had only one friend visit from 1905 to 1908.
Today you can tour sparsely-furnished Pine Knot by appointment, surrounded by oaks, redbuds, dogwoods and scampering critters, much as it was in the Roosevelts’ day. A large farm table is the only remaining piece of Roosevelt furniture.
Rapidan Camp
President Herbert Hoover and his wife, Lou, made 70 trips to their 164-acre retreat among Blue Ridge Mountain hemlocks and rhododendrons in today’s Shenandoah National Park. They named the 13-building enclave Rapidan Camp for the Mill Prong and Laurel Prong streams that merge to form the Rapidan River.
The president gave the Marines, who built it, three criteria in choosing a site: it should be at least 2,500 feet in elevation, within 100 miles of the nation’s capital, and have excellent fishing. Every building was within earshot of a babbling stream to “reduce our egotism, soothe our troubles and shame our wickedness,” he wrote.
The plain, pine-board buildings were designed to harmonize with the natural surroundings. The compound had the president’s cabin, cabins for 25 guests, a mess hall, offices, a community center, servants’ quarters, stables and a dog kennel. The Hoovers, both geologists, brought the outside in by “decorating” with rocks, crystals and hemlock branches.
While decompressing, the president also used the camp to address the nation’s problems. “I have discovered that even the work of government can be improved by leisurely discussion of its problems out under the trees where no bells ring or callers jar one’s thoughts,” he said.
An airplane dropped mail daily, and the president’s cottage had a telephone. Famous people visited, including Thomas Edison, Edsel Ford, Winston Churchill and British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The press was not welcome.
An avid angler, Hoover fished, not just for policy solutions, but for sport and escape. While fishing, he could “find relief from the pneumatic hammer of constant personal contracts,” he said. He built dams in the streams to create trout pools, and fed the fish beef hearts.
Today’s visitors can explore the woodsy paths, footbridges, streams and three still-standing buildings: the president’s cabin, dubbed the Brown House (facetiously named to differentiate it from the White House), the Prime Minister’s Cabin and Creel Cabin.
The Brown House is restored to its 1929 appearance with some original furnishings. The Prime Minister’s Cabin has exhibits on life at the camp and Hoover’s Depression-era presidency.
Poplar Forest
Building a private retreat was not the novel idea of hassled, 20th century presidents. Thomas Jefferson was the pioneer. He chose a 4,800-acre site near Lynchburg in what he called “western country,” and designed and built Poplar Forest there.
While in Europe for five years, Jefferson had studied European architecture. For his hideaway, he drew on the designs of 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio to build a neo-classical, country villa so he could “detach myself from public life, which I never loved,” he wrote.
Built between 1806 and 1823, the one-story brick house sits on a high basement, with four elongated octagonal rooms that surround the cube-shaped central chamber. A 16-foot skylight and tall, triple-hung windows illuminate the interior.
Reflecting Jefferson’s love of geometry, Poplar Forest was the first octagonal house in America. Two artificial mounds on each side of the sunken lawn screened octagonal privies.
While he started building it during his presidency, it came to be a favored respite in his retirement because Monticello had become an almost unbearable clamor of children, grandchildren, slaves and uninvited guests. At Poplar Forest, a three-day horse ride (90 miles) from Monticello, he rekindled his spirit in tranquility.
In 1811, at age 69, he wrote to a friend, Benjamin Rush, that he went to Poplar Forest three or four times a year, staying up to a month at a time. “I have fixed myself comfortably, keep some books here, bring others occasionally, am in the solitude of a hermit, and quite at leisure to attend to my absent friends,” he penned.
Today, visitors can take guided tours of the house and self-guided tours of lower-level exhibits, offices, grounds and slave quarters. Exhibits describe restoration, archaeology and slave life. A computer model demonstrates Jefferson’s landscape design.
Wexford
While Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy could have escaped Washington to family compounds in Hyannis Port, Mass.; Palm Beach, Fla.; or Newport, R.I., the couple chose 39 acres of farmland near Middleburg, Va.
While he was a U.S. senator, Jack became familiar with Loudoun County when he leased Glen Ora — a 400-acre farm in Virginia horse country, 40 miles from the White House.
Jackie designed a 3,500-square-foot stone and stucco ranch-style home, intended to be “nothing elaborate,” said Pamela Turnure, the first lady’s press secretary.
Completed in 1963 for $127,000, it had seven bedrooms, a Signal Corps switchboard, bomb shelter, stables and Secret Service workspace. They named it Wexford for the Ireland county where the Kennedy family originated.
At Wexford, Jackie could indulge in her horseback-riding passion. Caroline, age 6, rode her pony, Macaroni, and Jack buzzed 3-year-old John, Jr., around in a golf cart and hit golf balls in the pasture.
The president wrote, “This house may not be perfectly proportioned, but it has everything — all the places we need to get away from each other — so husband can have meetings…wife paint…all things so much bigger houses don’t have. I think it’s brilliant!”
Jackie and the children visited at times by helicopter or limousine without Jack. Sadly, they went there together only twice, in October and November 1963. Jackie sold Wexford in 1964 for $225,000. Today’s owners bought it in September 2017 for $2.9 million.
A private getaway may be an illusory notion in today’s hyperconnected world. But these four presidents understood the need to de-stress in settings far simpler than the high-stress White House.

Raul Hilberg was known for cultivating enemies. During faculty meetings at the University of Vermont, where he was a professor of political science from 1956 to 1991, the renowned historian of the Holocaust would unfailingly denounce the consensus position, whether it concerned faculty appointments or vacation policy. "He was an intensely stubborn and contrary person," one of his old colleagues told me. In The Politics of Memory, an autobiography published in 1996, Hilberg dedicated a chapter to attacking fellow historians whose work he considered derivative or misguided. Among those admonished was Lucy Dawidowicz, a popular Holocaust scholar and author of the emotional bestseller The War Against the Jews (1975); Dawidowicz provided "vaguely consoling words" that "could easily be clutched by all those who did not wish to look deeper," Hilberg complained.

But no one who wrote about the Holocaust nettled Hilberg more than Hannah Arendt. Hilberg’s anger toward the German refugee and New York intellectual erupted with the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem, in which Arendt told the tale of Adolf Eichmann, the man responsible for implementing the Final Solution, against the backdrop of his trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. (Eichmann was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina in May 1960. His trial in Jerusalem began in April 1961, and he was executed in May 1962.) Arendt’s study was serialized in five installments in The New Yorker in the spring of 1963 and then quickly published in book form in May of that year by Viking Press with its now infamous subtitle, "A Report on the Banality of Evil." The work has attained a mythic status. Penguin publishes it in two inexpensive paperback editions–one a "Penguin Classics" and the other a "Great Ideas" version that, with its matte blue-and-white cover, is attractively designed for display next to cash registers as an impulse buy.	
Hilberg died in 2007, and among the private papers he left to the University of Vermont library is a box stuffed with materials about his scholarly antagonists. Folders filled with Arendt clippings occupy half of the tightly jammed container. There is also a brown accordion folder holding two crisp copies of each of the five issues of The New Yorker in which Arendt’s study of Eichmann was serialized. Hilberg was obsessed with Arendt’s dispatches because two years before their appearance, with the Eichmann trial under way, he had published his own magnum opus, The Destruction of the European Jews, a multivolume work that is still widely considered in scholarly circles to be the first great history of the Holocaust and the cornerstone of Holocaust studies. "No other book will ever be, by my hand, annotated to such a degree," Claude Lanzmann remarked in 1993, eight years after the release of his epic film Shoah. "A beacon of a book, a breakwater of a book, a ship of history anchored in time and in a sense beyond time, undying, unforgettable, to which nothing in the course of ordinary historical production can be compared." (Hilberg is the only historian to appear in Shoah, which documents victims’ and perpetrators’ direct experiences of the Holocaust.)
As Hilberg read Arendt’s articles about Eichmann, he noticed a number of striking similarities to his own research. He tallied them on an accounting spreadsheet stored in the accordion folder with the New Yorker issues. At the bottom of the spreadsheet he divided the instances into "cert." and "prob." and penciled hash marks next to each category. Among the flagged passages is Arendt’s account of the plight of Bernard Lichtenberg, a Catholic priest in Berlin who was condemned to a concentration camp after speaking out against the deportation of the Jews. Hilberg noted the page on which Arendt’s version appeared and next to it wrote, in red ink, "verbatim."
Hilberg had discovered Lichtenberg’s story in Nazi foreign office files, and he recounted it in his book in what were, for him, unusually emotional terms: "Dompropst Bernard Lichtenberg of St. Hedwig’s Cathedral in Berlin, dared to pray openly for the Jews, including those who were baptized and those who were unbaptized." Arendt told Lichtenberg’s tale in the third New Yorker installment as a parenthetical aside in the story of a deported minister: "A similar fate befell the Catholic Dompropst Bernard Lichtenberg, of St. Hedwig’s Cathedral, in Berlin." Lichtenberg, Arendt wrote, "had dared to pray publicly for all Jews, baptized or not." In his book Hilberg footnoted the document from which he drew the anecdote; in The New Yorker Arendt gave no indication of her source–one of many similar instances.
In Eichmann in Jerusalem Arendt was a little more forthcoming about her debt to Hilberg. The book includes a note on sources in which she describes The Destruction of the European Jews as "the most exhaustive and the most soundly documented account of the Third Reich’s Jewish policies." There are five quotes in the book followed by a discreet "(Hilberg)," including a few she had not sourced to him in the New Yorker series. Still, many facts reported by Hilberg that appeared without attribution in Arendt’s magazine pieces remained uncredited to him in Eichmann.
Hilberg stopped documenting Arendt’s borrowings on his spreadsheet after he read the third installment, but "verbatim" was not his last word about the series. Years later, in a letter also found among his papers, he explained to one of Arendt’s biographers, Elzbieta Ettinger, that he had "noticed what she had done as soon as I read the installments in the New Yorker." He continued, "A lawyer of my publisher at the time asked me to draw up a list of items she had lifted. I found about eighty, but he also said that I would have to prove that she could not have obtained the information anywhere else. That proof I could not supply, except in such instances as an error of spelling that she had copied." In The Politics of Memory, Hilberg dedicated a few pages to Arendt and obliquely mentioned that others had commented on her mostly invisible reliance on his research; he also averred that her work "consisted only of unoriginal essays on anti-Semitism, imperialism, and general topics associated with totalitarianism." Despite his derision, Hilberg declined to publicly air his grievances. As a result, the scale of Arendt’s debt to him has remained largely unknown.
Hilberg’s indignation, as well as his decision to hold his fire, testify to the complex psychology of a Jewish man whose life had been threatened by the rise of Nazi terror but who managed to escape Europe and the Holocaust and lived thereafter with the resulting burden of guilt and luck. Arendt took a similar path out of Europe and carried much of the same emotional shrapnel. Hilberg and Arendt never met, in part because of his lingering bitterness toward her, but the strands of his research that she wove into her writing are only the most telling instances of the profound ways in which the two thinkers’ lives and ideas were intertwined. Both studied the problem of political evil in the twentieth century–Hilberg its social machinery in Nazi Germany, Arendt its origins in political systems like totalitarianism–and wrestled with the dilemma of the Jew in the twentieth century. Perhaps most important, at the core of their books about the Holocaust is a deep disappointment over the lack of Jewish resistance to the Nazis. After the war, both Hilberg and Arendt fashioned themselves as defiantly strong Jews, in contrast with their vision of the weak Jews they had left behind, and yet both remained fascinated by the story of those who were killed.
Raul Hilberg was born in Vienna in 1926, the only child of a cold, stolid mother and a quiet, proud father, whom Hilberg pitied and revered. In his youth Raul was a loner who took up solitary pursuits like geography, music and train spotting. His parents occasionally attended synagogue, but Hilberg was repelled by the irrationality of religion: "Already I was contrary-minded, turning away from religion, which at first became irrelevant to me and then an allergy," he recalled in his autobiography.
After Hitler marched into Vienna during the Anschluss, the Hilbergs were forced out of their apartment at gunpoint. Hilberg’s father’s spirit was broken after he was jailed; he told his son, "Hitler will put us to the wall." The family set off on a mad dash out of Europe, which ended a year later when they settled in Brooklyn after stopovers in France and Cuba. In 1944 Hilberg enlisted in the Army and ended up serving in a unit that swept through Germany as it was liberated; at one point Hilberg was in the Nazi headquarters in Munich and stumbled across portions of Hitler’s private library. Even before he was stationed in Europe, Hilberg had followed the scattered reports telling of the incipient genocide; in 1942 he made contact with an organization that asked him to call Stephen Wise, a leading rabbi in New York City. "What are you going to do about the complete annihilation of European Jewry?" Hilberg asked. Wise, Hilberg later remembered, hung up.
After the war, as a student first at Brooklyn College and then at Columbia, Hilberg was quickly drawn to the academic study of the fate he had escaped in Europe but that many of his relatives had not. "Briefly I weighed the possibility of writing a dissertation about an aspect of war crimes, and then I woke up," he explained in his autobiography. "It was the evidence that I wanted. My subject would be the destruction of the European Jews." He was soon spending long hours in a torpedo factory in Virginia that had been transformed into a repository for countless boxes of captured Nazi archives. Hilberg’s decision to study this material was not considered a professionally prudent one at the time, which may seem odd in the current era of Holocaust movies and proliferating Holocaust studies departments. But in the late 1940s and ’50s, the genocide of the Jews was a subject ignored in academic circles. History books of the era focused on the cult of Hitler and the Nazi terror but generally did not identify the slaughter of the Jews as a central part of the story of World War II. In the United States, the first college-level course dedicated to the subject of the Holocaust was taught in 1974–by Raul Hilberg. More than twenty years earlier, when Franz Neumann, Hilberg’s adviser at Columbia, learned of his dissertation topic, he quipped, "It’s your funeral."
Hilberg’s study opens with a bold statement: "Lest one be misled by the word ‘Jews’ in the title, let it be pointed out that this is not a book about the Jews. It is a book about the people who destroyed the Jews." Hilberg toiled for nearly a decade in the archives of the Nuremberg trials and other collections of recovered German documents. During his last lecture, which he delivered in Vermont just a few months before his death, he recalled the void that engulfed him at the outset of his research. "I was transported into a world for which I was totally unprepared," he explained in his dry, austere manner. "I would read a document, but I would not understand what it meant. The context had to be built record by record."
In Hilberg’s telling, the murder of the Jews was not a product simply of Hitler’s anti-Semitic rage (as Dawidowicz would later argue), nor was it preordained the moment the Nazi Party coalesced or even by the terror of Kristallnacht. "The destruction of the Jews was an administrative process, and the annihilation of Jewry required the implementation of systematic administrative measures in successive steps." Hilberg presented a staggering picture of the bureaucratic machinery of extermination, which developed slowly over time and inundated every sector of German society–not just the Einsatzgruppen and the SS but also the finance ministry, foreign office and railways; everyone knew what was happening, and everyone cooperated.
Hilberg defended his dissertation in 1955 and submitted it to prominent publishing houses. It was roundly rejected until 1961, when a young press in Chicago, Quadrangle Books, decided to publish the work, printing it in double columns on cheap paper. From there, the massive tome began quietly and slowly to win over admirers. In a glowing review in Commentary, the British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper wrote that Hilberg’s book was "not yet another chronicle of horrors. It is a careful, analytic, three-dimensional study of a social and political experience unique in history: an experience which no one could believe possible till it happened and whose real significance still bewilders us." Michael Marrus, the foremost historiographer of the Holocaust, says that it is now generally agreed that before Hilberg "there was not a subject. No panoramic, European-wide sense of what had happened. That’s what Hilberg provided."
In Vermont, Hilberg embraced the role of the lordly European intellectual: he was a distant and often haughty scholar who favored somber, elegant suits and gave few indications of his personal entanglement with his research. On campus, he was revered for his courses and books (altogether he wrote and edited seven volumes concerning the Holocaust). I was told by Richard Sugarman, a philosophy professor at the University of Vermont who grew close to Hilberg, that "The phrase ‘spellbinding lecturer’ doesn’t do justice to him. Was it a little intimidating talking to him? Sure. He was not a recycled soul–he was an original."
Beyond the mountains of Vermont, however, Hilberg’s achievements were generally unknown outside the scholarly community. The Destruction of the European Jews is scarcely mentioned in Peter Novick’s acclaimed The Holocaust in American Life (1999), which chronicles the rise of Holocaust consciousness. For Novick it was not Hilberg but the Eichmann trial and Arendt’s reporting on it that "effectively broke fifteen years of near silence." After the trial, Novick writes, "there emerged in American culture a distinct thing called ‘the Holocaust’–an event in its own right, not simply a subdivision of general Nazi barbarism."
Hannah Arendt was born twenty years before Raul Hilberg, in 1906, the only child of a middle-class European Jewish family. She grew up mostly in Königsberg, and Judaism was not an integral part of her daily life; religious observance was minimal, and anti-Semitic incidents were only an occasional irritant. According to Elisabeth Young-Bruehl’s sensitive biography, Hannah Arendt: For the Love of the World, Arendt was a moody young woman, particularly after her father died in 1913. She was drawn to books early on, and Goethe was the touchstone of her education. This led her eventually to the universities in Marburg and Heidelberg, where she studied philosophy with Karl Jaspers and Martin Heidegger.
Arendt is now popularly thought of as a nondenominational political theorist. But during the Nazi rise to power, she dedicated herself to Zionist relief organizations trying to help Jews flee Europe. Like Hilberg, an arrest awakened her to the severity of the Nazi regime: in 1933 she was apprehended for collecting documents for a Zionist organization. Also like Hilberg, Arendt directed her fear and anger at the quiescence of those around her. In 1936, when she attended the founding conference of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva, she wrote to her future husband, Heinrich Blücher, that "the Polish Jews will stop our mouths just as the German Jews did three years ago. And in the end we’ll all go to hell." She worked with relief groups while planning her own escape from Germany; she reached New York City in 1941 and was soon writing for a number of Jewish publications. In an essay published in the New York German-Jewish newspaper Aufbau, she urged, "We can do battle against antisemitism only if we battle Hitler with weapons in our hands."
After the war, Arendt’s activism waned as she grew intellectually fascinated with how the Nazis had managed to carry out the Final Solution. An early indication of her interest was a review she wrote for Commentary in 1952 of Léon Poliakov’s Bréviaire de la Haine: Le IIIe Reich et les Juifs (Breviary of Hate: The Third Reich and the Jews), which is generally recognized as one of two minor volumes on the Holocaust published before Hilberg’s landmark work. Arendt concluded the piece by underscoring the paucity of writing on the subject: "Research into Nazism, therefore, so frequently minimized today as ‘mere’ history, is indispensable for our understanding of the problems of the present and the immediate future." For Arendt, covering the Eichmann trial was the perfect opportunity to explore those problems by delving into the psyche of the perpetrators, who intrigued her much more than the victims. As Arendt later told Samuel Grafton, a journalist commissioned by Look in the fall of 1963 to write an article about her account of Eichmann’s trial and the controversy it sparked, "I wanted to see one of the chief culprits with my own eyes as he appeared in the flesh. When, many years ago, I described the totalitarian system and analyzed the totalitarian mentality [in her study of Nazism and Stalinism, The Origins of Totalitarianism], it was always a ‘type,’ rather than individuals."
Arendt spent weeks in Jerusalem observing the trial, and she left convinced that Eichmann was not a figure of great evil but rather an oddly cheerful, pathetic man whose desire for personal advancement meshed tightly with the gears of the totalitarian machine. In The New Yorker, she was critical of the Israeli prosecution and faulted the lead prosecutor for wanting "to try the most abnormal monster the world had ever seen." Unlike the prosecutor, Arendt saw Eichmann not as a monster but a bureaucrat. "The trouble with Eichmann," she said, "was precisely that so many were like him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are, terribly and terrifyingly normal."
It is often forgotten that Arendt folded Eichmann’s story into a more general account of the Holocaust–the table of contents of Eichmann in Jerusalem resembles a timeline of the event–and that this broader context introduced innumerable readers to the idea of the Holocaust. Arendt does not appear to have done research in archives with German documents, and given how little had been written on the subject she had few options when she looked for published sources of background material. There was, of course, one source that contained it all: The Destruction of the European Jews.
Arendt’s papers show that she had a complicated relationship with Hilberg’s work even before she began writing about Eichmann. When she returned to New York from Jerusalem, in August 1961, there was a letter from Quadrangle Books offering a special discount on The Destruction of the European Jews. In the copy of the letter in Arendt’s files, Quadrangle’s president, Melvin Brisk, promised that Hilberg’s book would provide a very different picture of Eichmann than the Israeli prosecution had in Jerusalem. "Hilberg shows that Eichmann was a bureaucrat worrying about a thousand details rather than a master planner." Brisk explained, "We make this offer (good only until September 30th) because the Eichmann trial–which is still under way as I write this letter–makes the book doubly important in explaining what happened and why." Arendt replied on August 7, enclosing a check for $14.95.
Brisk’s sales pitch was not Arendt’s first exposure to Hilberg’s book. Two years earlier, Arendt had been asked by Princeton University Press to review the manuscript of The Destruction of the European Jews; she advised Princeton not to publish it. In a letter in her archives dated April 1959, which Hilberg himself discovered, Princeton editor Gordon Hubel thanked Arendt for her "invaluable assistance" and tried to assuage any guilt she might have felt about her decision: "after we had rejected this manuscript," Hubel confided, "we learned from Hilberg that he has $10,000 in financial backing toward the publication of this study, so I do not feel that our declining was in any way fatal to its eventual publication." (In the end, a $15,000 donation financed the book’s publication by Quadrangle.)
Arendt’s evaluation of Hilberg’s manuscript is not among her papers. A plausible explanation of why she advised against its publication appears in a 1963 letter she wrote to the German publisher of Eichmann in Jerusalem. In it, she says that Hilberg "worked for 15 years only with the sources and if he had not written a very terrible first chapter, in which he did not understand much about German history, the book would be, so to speak, perfect. No one will be able to write about the topic without using it." Arendt reiterated the point the following year in a letter to Karl Jaspers, offering that Hilberg’s book "is really excellent, but only because it is a simple report." In his first chapter, Hilberg provides a brief timeline of anti-Semitism in Europe that begins with the Roman Empire under Constantine and ends with the Holocaust. Hilberg’s long view of history clashed with Arendt’s strong belief that the Holocaust was something entirely new–a product of modern society and the totalitarian system.
But while Arendt belittled some of its conclusions, she clearly recognized what a gold mine the book contained. Her reliance on Hilberg was apparent to Hugh Trevor-Roper, who reviewed Eichmann in Jerusalem in the Sunday Times two years after reviewing The Destruction of the European Jews in Commentary. Trevor-Roper postulated that, except for the trial, Hilberg’s "masterly study" was Arendt’s main source. "She acknowledges her debt," Trevor-Roper wrote, "but the full extent of that debt can be appreciated only by those who have read both. Again and again the arguments, the very phrases, are unconsciously repeated." Trevor-Roper’s review was largely forgotten, as was his conclusion that "indeed, behind the whole of Miss Arendt’s book stands the overshadowing bulk of Mr. Hilberg’s."
Despite her opinion that Hilberg’s study was a "simple report," Arendt does acknowledge its quotidian perfection at one point in her book–though, tellingly, in a parenthetical–when describing the arduous task faced by Eichmann’s Israeli prosecutors. "The prosecution, it must be admitted, was in a most difficult position in finding its way through this labyrinth of parallel institutions, which it had to do each time it wanted to pin some specific responsibility on Eichmann," she explained, before discreetly adding: "(If the trial were to take place today, this task would be much easier, since Raul Hilberg in his The Destruction of the European Jews has succeeded in presenting the first clear description of this incredibly complicated machinery of destruction.)"
Like The Destruction of the European Jews, Eichmann in Jerusalem is mostly about the perpetrators. When Arendt does focus on the Jews, her concern is not isolated episodes of heroic resistance or the immense scale of human suffering but rather the Judenräte, the Jewish councils in Nazi-controlled Europe. It was an important matter to investigate. The councils were Jewish municipal administrations that provided basic services to ghettoized Jews and enforced Nazi orders and regulations, including compiling names of Jews for deportation. For Arendt the councils were a big moral question mark. She describes them as frequently willing and self-serving collaborators in helping the Nazis execute the Final Solution. In lines that have been repeated countless times since, she writes, "To a Jew this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of the whole dark story." The cooperation of Jewish leaders, she continues, "had been known about before, but it has now been exposed for the first time in all its pathetic and sordid detail by Raul Hilberg."
After this broad acknowledgment, Arendt peppers her account of the Judenräte with mostly unattributed quotations from German documents quoted in Hilberg’s book. Her most infamous act of blind borrowing is her provocative, offhand reference to "Dr. Leo Baeck, Chief Rabbi of Berlin, who in the eyes of both Jews and Gentiles was the ‘Jewish Führer.’" Jacob Robinson, who was an assistant to the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, wrote a book attacking Arendt’s portrayal of Eichmann in which he zeroed in on the Baeck statement and identified its likely source. Robinson hypothesized that the source "is probably Hilberg, who was careful to note that the expression ‘Jewish Führer’ applied to Baeck was a casual remark by Eichmann’s assistant, Dieter Wisliceny; it was left to Miss Arendt to ascribe the use of the epithet to ‘Jews and Gentiles’ in general."
Certainly Arendt’s ideas about Eichmann and his "banality" were kindling for a fire. But it was the material she drew from Hilberg on the Jewish councils–less than twenty of the nearly 300 pages of her book–that ignited the furor. The implication of her account was that whereas Nazis like Eichmann were merely banal bureaucrats, Jews had experienced a moral collapse during the war by failing to resist totalitarianism. The Anti-Defamation League distributed a letter urging local offices to denounce her, the World Jewish Congress released a pamphlet about the book and multiple Jewish organizations hired researchers to find errors in it. Nearly every Jewish publication in America ran articles attacking her views. Arendt’s old friend Gershom Scholem broke with her and wrote a public letter in which he questioned her portrayal of the Jews: "In your treatment of the problem of how the Jews reacted to these extreme circumstances–to which neither of us was exposed–I detect, often enough, in place of balanced judgment, a kind of demagogic will-to-overstatement." Scholem could have been describing Hilberg’s account of the Jewish councils–which is not surprising, given that Hilberg was Arendt’s source. In fact, Hilberg’s fastidiousness regarding the Baeck incident was an exception: he was generally indifferent, sometimes archly so, to the dilemmas faced by Jews in the ghettos. At one point he concludes that "Jews tried to avert disaster: by judicious compliance with orders, and sometimes by anticipatory compliance with orders not yet issued," such as the forced labor program that the Jewish council in the Warsaw ghetto had set up. Where Arendt surpassed Hilberg was in the words of moral opprobrium she flung at several Jewish leaders.
As the negative reviews of Eichmann in Jerusalem poured in, Arendt wrote to Mary McCarthy: "One can say that the mob–intellectual or otherwise–has been successfully mobilized." Arendt alleged in another letter, to a reader, that she was an innocent bystander who had been made a scapegoat. But she also recognized that the cause of the furor was her use of Hilberg’s Judenräte material. "That I am now in the center of this campaign is almost an accident. Ever since the publication of Hilberg’s book, those organizations have been worrying about what to do," she wrote in response to a particularly vicious review of her work by Lionel Abel in the Summer 1963 issue of Partisan Review.
Arendt was not happy. She felt her ideas were being trampled by the uproar over Eichmann in Jerusalem. She was not without justification. Samuel Grafton noted in the draft of his Look article that "according to Viking Press, the book has sold only about 10,000 copies, an extremely small number for a work about which so much has been said. Many who are discussing it have not read it; in a sense the controversy has floated loose from the book, and become a phenomenon in its own right." As Grafton’s son, the historian Anthony Grafton, explains in his essay "Arendt and Eichmann at the Dinner Table," Look ended up killing his father’s article because as the contretemps heated up, Arendt grew irritable and stopped cooperating.
Hilberg was not happy either. After toiling for thirteen years on his book, he was being eclipsed by someone who had worked for little more than two years on hers. "Who was I, after all?" Hilberg asked bitterly in his autobiography. "She, the thinker, and I, the laborer who wrote only a simple report, albeit one which was indispensable once she had exploited it." The situation was made clear in a letter that Siegfried Moses, the head of the Council of Jews from Germany, wrote to Arendt that spring. "I came to New York with the draft of a statement which was to be published by the Council of Jews from Germany. It was to attack the presentation given in Hilberg’s book." But, Moses added, "Now, the defense of the council must oppose primarily your articles." In his autobiography, Hilberg was emphatic in pointing out the differences between his and Arendt’s arguments. He noted that whereas Arendt’s analysis of Jewish leadership was restricted to the Judenräte, in The Destruction of the European Jews he had written that the Jews had a centuries-old tradition of saving themselves by complying with violent, anti-Semitic rulers–a precedent that collided with the unprecedented brutality of the Nazis.
But just as Arendt did not give Hilberg the full credit he was due, Hilberg did not properly acknowledge her insights. In writing about Eichmann, she had proposed a bold new way of describing how ordinary Germans had been drawn into the machinery of destruction–a discussion that Hilberg had avoided. On a more immediate level, Arendt, despite having taken liberties with some of Hilberg’s facts, had nevertheless acted as a popular interpreter of his research–providing visibility for a book that could easily have fallen down an academic mine shaft. In the process, this kick-started the rise of the study of the Holocaust.
There is no better testament to the cross-pollination of their ideas than the career of Christopher Browning, author of Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland and one of the world’s most respected Holocaust scholars. Browning became interested in the Holocaust in the late ’60s when he was an activist against the Vietnam War. Like so many students at the time, he turned to Eichmann in Jerusalem in the hopes of understanding how governments are drawn into planning death and destruction. After noticing Arendt’s few references to Hilberg, Browning bought a copy of The Destruction of the European Jews. He read it during a long convalescence from mononucleosis, and it changed his life. "Some people have religious conversion experiences," Browning said at a memorial service for Hilberg; "upon reading Hilberg I had a life-changing academic conversion experience." Browning had been working toward a master’s in French history but then decided to write a dissertation on an aspect of Hilberg’s research. "Hilberg became visible to me by virtue of Arendt," Browning told me. "For most people it was an entirely negative connection–but for me, it turned out to be entirely positive."
Another kink in the story is that the claim on which Hilberg and Arendt had staked so much–Jewish compliance during the war–is considered, even by their admirers, to be the blind spot of their oeuvres. Young-Bruehl writes in her biography that Arendt’s knowledge of the Holocaust-era ghettos "was not always extensive enough to support her generalizations." Amos Elon, in the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of Eichmann in Jerusalem, says Arendt "was inexcusably flippant." Hilberg, of course, was a meticulous researcher, yet the passages about the Jewish councils in The Destruction of the European Jews have a very different feel from the rest of the book. Whereas the book is generally heavily footnoted, these pages have long runs of clean or lightly footnoted discursive prose. Had Hilberg strayed from the facts? Michael Marrus, who has written critically about Arendt’s and Hilberg’s accounts of the Judenräte, says that while many Jewish historians have erred "too much on the side of heroism and resistance," Hilberg "was way off on the other side of the spectrum. His views about the Jews are sometimes almost caricatural." Browning agrees, and adds that Hilberg had an ornery attachment to these passages: "That’s the one chapter he would never change. He had a stubborn streak."
Hilberg and Arendt may have clung to these heretical positions because their exodus from Europe left them with similarly tortured perspectives on the Jews they had left behind. Both writers were steeped in German-Jewish culture, which had long disdained the less cultured Jews in Eastern Europe. Complicating matters was that it was Eastern Jews who had been overwhelmingly slaughtered. Arendt’s criticism of the Israeli prosecution in Eichmann’s trial was spiced by her distaste for what she saw as the Israeli muddle of Middle Eastern and Eastern European Jews. Her most famous relationship was with Heidegger, the philosopher and Nazi Party member, and her husband, Blücher, was a German gentile. In a similar pattern, Hilberg endlessly criticized Jewish scholars while heaping praise on German scholars who were studying the same material.
More personally and concretely, though, the works of Hilberg and Arendt were colored by their experiences as young secular Jews influenced by Zionism. Arendt’s Zionist work–before and immediately after the war–is well-known. Hilberg’s Zionist background, on the other hand, has generally gone unrecognized. In his autobiography, he says little about his engagement with the Jewish community in Vienna. But his best friend from his youth, Eric Marder, recalls that both boys had gone to a Zionist school in Vienna, which taught them the need for Jews to build a home of their own and to defend themselves. The lessons stuck, says Marder, who left Vienna shortly after Hilberg’s family. Marder also ended up in Brooklyn, and he recalls that when he and Hilberg were in high school, they would walk home and talk about what was happening in Europe. "We both felt that politically the Jewish community in Europe had behaved badly. Instead of fighting the Nazis, they had surrendered to them."
At the time that Hilberg and Marder were having those conversations, Arendt was expressing similar disappointment about the apparent unwillingness of the Jews to stand up for themselves. During the war, Arendt wrote a series of articles for Jewish newspapers in the United States calling for Jews to form an army to fight back. In time, though, her writing reflected a growing, almost shamefaced recognition that the Jews would go down meekly. In 1944, in the article "From Army to Brigade," she spoke of the "unbearable humiliation of the Jewish people, who felt that the whole world had damned them to the degrading role of victimhood."
Later on, both thinkers wanted to be seen as clear-eyed observers, unsullied by any attachment to the material they were studying–hence Hilberg’s stance as a disinterested scholar. "He wasn’t going to let somebody else define him–as a victim or a persecuted Jew," Browning told me. "He just didn’t want to go there." After the publication of Eichmann in Jerusalem, Gershom Scholem wrote to Arendt that she showed "little trace" of "Ahabath Israel: ‘Love of the Jewish people.’" She eagerly accepted his assessment: "I do not ‘love’ the Jews, nor do I ‘believe’ in them; I merely belong to them as a matter of course, beyond dispute or argument." She had criticized Hilberg’s work by labeling it a "simple report," but when she was attacked for being a self-hating Jew she used the label as a shield. "My position is that I wrote a report and that I am not in politics, either Jewish or otherwise," she explained to Mary McCarthy in September 1963. "In other words my point would be that what the whole furor is about are facts and neither theories nor ideas." She argued that she did not view the Jews any differently from any of the other people of Europe.
But it is hard not to see the youthful anger of both Hilberg and Arendt–the expression of an inchoate Zionist zeal–occasionally ruffling their more sober later writing. Scholem perceptively pointed to something very personal in Arendt’s work. In his letter, he told her, "Your book speaks only of the weakness of the Jewish stance in the world. I am ready enough to admit that weakness; but you put such emphasis upon it that, in my view, your account ceases to be objective and acquires overtones of malice." With Hilberg, such overtones are evident when he describes innocent Jewish families going to their death: "During ghetto-clearing operations many Jewish families were unable to fight, unable to petition, unable to flee, and also unable to move to the concentration point to get it over with. They waited for the raiding parties in their homes, frozen and helpless." The writing in the works of both thinkers rings with an almost visceral desire to distance themselves from the weak Jews that they imagined they had left behind, and from whom they had hoped for so much more during the war. Young-Bruehl says that in her life as well as her thinking, Arendt "took the position that I am not a victim here–I am a resistant." But the outwardly sober and unemotional Hilberg was occasionally agitated by a resistant nerve. Yehuda Bauer, the eminent Israeli Holocaust scholar, recalls a moment when he was giving a lecture with Hilberg before a college class in Boston during the ’70s. Bauer spoke about Jewish resistance to the Nazis; Hilberg began his rejoinder on a characteristically dry note before suddenly losing his temper. "He yelled at those students and he said, ‘How many of you have guns in your home?’" Bauer remembers. "I said to him, ‘You think there will be Nazis in Boston?’ But he wasn’t talking to the students–he was talking to the Jews in Europe. For a moment he forgot himself."
Discouraged by the response to Eichmann in Jerusalem, Arendt mostly stopped writing about Jewish issues. But she did not refrain from criticizing the Jewish world, particularly when it came to the justice of the State of Israel, which she had lost faith in, and American Jews’ stalwart defense of it. This political quarrel, though, obscured Arendt’s complicated understanding of her Jewish identity. It’s worth remembering that her first book was not a political treatise but a sympathetic biography of Rahel Varnhagen, the secular German-Jewish salon hostess who died believing that the great shame of her life, being born a Jew, was also her greatest gift. Similarly, Arendt never stopped feeling connected to her own Jewish heritage, but always on her own terms. Young-Bruehl tells of Arendt’s later years, when "everyone was very interested to observe that she put a great deal of energy into attending Seder with her friends–and the marking of Jewish holidays–in a way that she hadn’t really before."
Professionally, Hilberg followed a different path after writing his great work. He maintained a single-minded commitment to The Destruction of the European Jews, advising translators on new editions right up to his death. He also worked more broadly on spreading a historical understanding of the Holocaust. He was an integral member of the council that oversaw the creation of the US Holocaust Memorial and Museum in Washington, and in letters to fellow council members he regularly warned against allowing the museum to become a community memorial for Jews, one dedicated to the image of the Jewish victim, instead of being a museum that would shed light on the entirety of the Holocaust.
Hilberg, like Arendt, remained largely estranged from collective Jewish life. He continued to live in Vermont, far from Jewish havens like New York City, and was twice married to non-Jews. He avoided synagogue and relished taking positions that antagonized many Jews. For instance, he rallied to the defense of Norman Finkelstein, who was lambasted for his book The Holocaust Industry, which argued that American Jewish institutions have exploited the memory of the Holocaust, turning it into shmaltz for financial and political gain. Peter Novick called Finkelstein’s work "a charge into darkness that sheds no light." Hilberg not only praised Finkelstein’s "analytical abilities" but also noted his strength in defying the establishment. In letters and interviews, Hilberg attacked both the community of Holocaust scholars in the United States and the Jewish organizations that had sprung up to memorialize the Holocaust. What he had warned the Holocaust Memorial council against had come to pass. After drawing such a stark picture of the Jewish collapse in The Destruction of the European Jews, Hilberg was horrified that many American Jews would willingly and eagerly link themselves with the history of victimhood. "Where is our dignity?" he asked an editor at Knopf in 1988.
At the lecture he delivered a few months before he died, a question was put to Hilberg: "Why do you not feel part of your community?" Without missing a beat, he responded, in an even voice, "I don’t feel part of anything. I don’t feel part of the university I’ve been a part of for decades. I don’t feel part of Burlington, where I’ve spent all my years since 1956. I think some of us are just destined to be alone." But Hilberg’s sense of being a man apart concealed the intense tug of war he had with his past. In his later years Hilberg returned to the subject of the Judenräte when he decided to edit the meticulous diaries of Adam Czerniakow, the head of the Jewish council in the Warsaw ghetto. Hilberg’s work on the volume is distinguished by a nuanced sympathy for the impossible situation in which the Jews had found themselves, but most of all for Czerniakow’s strong, silent decision to kill himself in the end rather than betray his principles.
Hilberg’s second wife, Gwendolyn Montgomery, who was born an Episcopalian, converted to Judaism in 1992, twelve years into their marriage. She did so for reasons of her own, without Hilberg’s prodding. She admits to having been surprised when Hilberg began quietly attending synagogue with her soon after her conversion. Hilberg’s friends, too, were surprised to learn that his postmortem arrangements included a request for a memorial service at the Burlington synagogue.
Hilberg had not become religious in any traditional sense. Like Arendt, his relationship with Judaism was very much on his terms. The legacy of Jewish victimhood galled him as much as it did Arendt, but it didn’t stifle his respect for the Jewish conscience. Here it was his turn to borrow from Arendt. Shortly before the end of the war, Arendt wrote an intriguing set of essays about the notion of "the Jew as pariah," in which she identified Sholom Aleichem, Franz Kafka and Henrich Heine as heirs to the greatest Jewish tradition. "It is the tradition of a minority of Jews who have not wanted to become upstarts, who preferred the status of ‘conscious pariah,’" she claimed. "All vaunted Jewish qualities–the ‘Jewish heart,’ humanity, humor, disinterested intelligence–are pariah qualities." In 1965, two years after the appearance of Eichmann in Jerusalem, Hilberg published a little-noticed essay in Midstream magazine in which he described the conditions that had motivated Germans to perpetrate the Holocaust. He then expressed his admiration for the pariahs of his people. "Jews are iconoclasts. They will not worship idols," he wrote. "The Jews are the conscience of the world. They are the father figures, stern, critical, and forbidding." He returned to the subject in his last lecture, in which he explained that despite his expressions of derision, his commitment had been "to my people, whether they want it or not, or like it. You know, I could have written my dissertation on multipartite treaties. I could have been a big shot. No, I wrote the dissertation that everyone without exception who was an adult told me not to write."
This was not a description of the many Jews Hilberg was constantly criticizing but rather an idealized description of the community of Jews he imagined being part of, and people close to him understood as much. In his final months, as he was dying of lung cancer, one of the few people Hilberg wanted to see was Richard Sugarman. Many years earlier, Sugarman, who is an Orthodox Jew, had been walking around campus with a rabbi distributing Passover matzo. Sugarman remembers how the rabbi respectfully left Hilberg alone. "It seems to me that Professor Hilberg has his own avodah," Sugarman recalls the rabbi saying, "his own way of service."

Olympia to honor Indigenous Peoples’ Day | The Olympian
The proclamation also notes the city’s responsibility to “oppose the systemic racism toward Indigenous People in the United States, which perpetuates poverty and income inequality, and exacerbates disproportionate health, education and social stability.”
In October 2014, nearly 40 citizens asked the Olympia City Council to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Several local tribes were represented at that meeting. Nearly two dozen people participated in a blessing and sang Native American songs outside City Hall.
One request was for Indigenous Peoples’ Day to replace Columbus Day. The latter is a federal holiday that honors Christopher Columbus, an explorer with a troublesome legacy of slavery and exploitation of Native Americans.
The city of Olympia does not recognize or celebrate Columbus Day, which falls on Oct. 12 this year.

Director Michael Moore keen to debate former Trump aide Steve Bannon
By The Canadian Press
Sun., Sept. 9, 2018
Documentarian Michael Moore says he would eagerly take part in a debate against Steve Bannon, a former strategist for U.S. President Donald Trump, despite controversy over the polarizing pundit’s participation in a Toronto forum this fall.
Last week, it was announced that Bannon would defend the merits of political populism at the Munk Debates in November, shortly after he was disinvited from next month’s New Yorker festival in response to backlash from readers and celebrities who threatened to drop out of the event.

In Toronto, Bannon will go up against author and editor David Frum at the event on Nov. 2.
The news fuelled a heated debate over whether the ex-chairman of far-right publication Breitbart News should be granted a platform to share his views.
But Moore, who premiered his new documentary Fahrenheit 11/9 at the Toronto International Film Festival on Thursday, said it’s too late for that.

Bannon already has a place in the public discourse, he said, and it’s better to engage him than to let his rhetoric go unchallenged.

“You want to hear him speak,” Moore told The Canadian Press in an interview. “You always want to hear the devil speak. You always want the devil to tell you his plans.”
Moore said he would jump at the chance to square off with Bannon over their clashing brands of populist politics, but played coy about who he believed would prevail in a hypothetical debate.

“I know how it would go,” he said. “I can’t say right now. You’ll find out.”
Documentarian Errol Morris made a similar case in defending his decision to profile Bannon in “American Dharma,” which is set to be screened at TIFF on Sunday.
“To interview Bannon is not to endorse him OR his ideas,” he tweeted Thursday. “(Is this so difficult to understand?).”
A representative for the documentary quashed speculation that Bannon would attend Sunday’s screening after he was reportedly spotted in Venice during the film’s world premiere, which he did not attend.

Let's Talk About Guns, Gun Makers and the 2nd Amendment After Las Vegas Shooting
I have no intention of owning any of these gun related stocks. They are just too unpredictable all things being considered.
Stephen Guilfoyle
Updated Oct 3, 2017 1:53 PM EDT
"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited... It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose." -- Antonin Scalia
Situation Miserable
A deranged man pokes the barrel of an automatic rifle out of a 32nd-story window. The people on the other end of his sights have their backs turned. They are listening to music, probably loud music. This is a party atmosphere. Over the next few minutes, chaos would ensue. People would be shot, likely never knowing where the rounds came from. Folks were probably injured by panicked crowds as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The crowd of 22,000 innocent human beings started out tightly packed together. It would obviously not take much to cause massive numbers of casualties.
Financial markets do not care. The markets did not care when Biblical rains fell upon Houston. Did not care when Mother Nature took an eraser to the Florida Keys... and certainly did not care when the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico took the very worst that she had to offer. So, why then, would a market place driven by algorithms that are not themselves driven by emotion nor sentiment care when one very sick person would intentionally harm the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for almost 600 people that he did not know, and impact exponentially everyone who cares for those folks, or was simply present on Sunday night?
Tesla, Equifax, and Other Things You Need to Know Before Markets Open
The broader equity market, as represented by the S&P 500 scored a gain of 0.4% on Monday, while the Russell 2000, also known as the Small Cap Index soared 1.2% on the session. Why? Does mass murder impact monetary policy? Does it help push tax reform through the legislative process? I think not. I don't think that has anything to do with price discovery. Know what easily outperformed the broader markets yesterday? Gun stocks, or rather the stocks of companies that manufacture firearms. You knew that already, though, because it happens every time that we, as a nation experience, a mass casualty event caused by a person with such a weapon.
Gun Stocks
Let's take a look at four such manufacturers. First there's Olin (OLN) . That stock closed at $36.52 yesterday, which was up 6.6%. Never heard of them? Ever hear of Winchester? Now, you're getting warm. American Outdoor Brands (AOBC) , the parent company of Smith & Wesson, saw a one-day gain of 3.2%. Sturm Ruger (RGR) +3.5%, Vista Outdoor (VSTO) +2.4%. Olin has had a good year to date, but the other three are all negative for 2017, AOBC, and VSTO decisively so. What drives these stocks as much as the fundamentals? Gun rights legislation -- or, should I say, the fear of such legislation.
Gun Stocks Close Higher in Wake of Las Vegas Shooting
The Second Amendment
The Second Amendment to the US Constitution states: "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." That's open to interpretation, which gets to the root of our problem. Is the right to bear arms the right to individually bear arms, or simply the right of the states and territories to raise a militia (National Guard)? We'll likely never truly know what our nation's founders were thinking at the time.
Stephen Paddock
The weapons used by Stephen Paddock on Sunday night were already illegal, you say? That's what I thought. That's what I always thought (and I am a certified Small Arms Master Gunner), until I researched this article. That's when I found out that automatic weapons may be legally owned, as long as they are registered with the Federal government, and were manufactured prior to May 1986. Isn't that interesting? I have no idea if Mr. Paddock's rifles were legal.
Without opining on the politics of this situation, past history tells us that there will likely be some modification to existing gun laws, at least in the state most recently impacted that will make it that much tougher or more expensive to own firearms, but not break the industry. We've been through this a few times now. My thought is that the inflated prices for the gun makers will recede, only to rise again, when a politician with an anti-gun rights agenda also rises.
ShotSpotter Up as Shooting Puts Spotlight on Gunshot Detection Technology
That would be why these stocks all sold off so hard once Donald Trump was elected president. Not just the stocks, but the weapons themselves, as well as ammunition had all traded at extremely inflated prices under an Obama administration that looked likely headed toward a Clinton administration. In other words, these investments are such that their fortunes turn in opposite direction to the politically inspired climate. I have no intention of owning any of these stocks. Politics has nothing to do with that. They are just too unpredictable.
Macro
All Day - Total Vehicle Sales (September): Expecting 16.6 million, August 16.1 million annualized. Know what month was the last one that saw vehicle sales top expectations? Need a hint? OK. It's been a while. December 2016. Very good. Can't believe you got it right away. The truth is that this item is tough to call. You are going to now start to see increased demand in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, but that will play off against Hurricane Irma's depressive impact on Floridian demand.
08:30 - Fed Speaker: Federal Reserve Gov. Jerome Powell will speak on financial regulation from Washington, DC. Powell does occupy a permanent voting slot at the FOMC as a governor, but it is unclear whether he will touch on policy at today's event. Powell will answer questions from both the audience and the media today.
08:55 - Redbook (Weekly): Last Week 4.0% y/y. Over the past five weeks, this series, which measures chain store retail sales, has been red hot, averaging year-over-year growth of 4.16% over that time. You must remember that prior to late August, the Redbook had not touched that kind of growth since early 2015.

UN: Over 500,000 people killed annually by small arms
By
News Agency of Nigeria
-
June 19, 2018
More than 500,000 people are killed annually by revolvers, pistols, assault rifles, machine guns and other similar weapons, a new UN report, ‘Small Arms Survey’, has found.
UN Chef de Cabinet Maria Viotti said the small arms and light weapons, which ended up on battlefields or urban streets and elsewhere, were a big problem for the world.
Government representatives are meeting at UN Headquarters to review global action to address the illegal flow of these light weapons.
The study estimated that there were over one billion legal and illicit firearms in the world today, including 857 million in civilian hands.
It also found that American men and women were the dominant owners, owning nearly half of all small arms in world
The report said 393 million of the civilian-held firearms – or 46 per cent – were in the U.S., adding this is “more than those held by civilians in the other top 25 countries combined”.
It said that of over one billion firearms worldwide in December 2017 also included 133 million held by government militaries and 22.7 million by law enforcement agencies.
The new global figure is significantly higher than the 875 million firearms estimated in the last survey in 2007, which included 650 million civilian-held firearms.
Viotti said while those pulling the trigger ranged from soldiers and police officers, to civilians – sometimes acting in self-defence – most are members of armed groups, terrorist organisations, criminal gangs, or national security forces who are abusing their power.
“It is not simply a question of addressing government stockpiles. Out of some 900 million small arms in the world, three-quarters are in civilian hands – the majority unlicensed.”
The UN official said controlling and regulating the flow of small arms and light weapons was a unique challenge, which required action that went beyond national security institutions.
This includes initiatives such as providing alternative livelihoods to former combatants, or working with grass-roots organisations and community violence reduction programmes.
Viotti added that small arms control was also a prerequisite for stability and conflict prevention, critical to maintaining peace and achieving sustainable development.
She pointed out that small arms and light weapons were also a factor in large-scale human rights abuses and the forced displacement of civilians.
According to her, addressing the root causes of violence and conflict is integral to reaching these goals.
The conference, underway at the UN, follows on from a 2001 Programme of Action by which countries committed to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.

Afghanistan's Hekmatyar Gets Peace Deal Mixed Reaction
share
Print
A peace deal signed with a notorious Afghan warlord is opposed by some political figures and rights groups who worry about its impact on the country’s fledgling democracy.
Thursday's agreement opens a new chapter for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who fought against the Soviet Union in the 1980s and whose fighters were once beneficiaries of CIA support. He was later accused of abuses during Afghanistan's brutal civil war in the 1990s and designated as a terrorist by the United States in 2003 for his support of al-Qaida.
Political analysts say concerns over the warlord's return to politics are legitimate, and much depends on how he acts going forward.
Amin Karim, representative of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, right, and Attaurahman Saleem, head of delegation of peace talks, left, exchange documents after signing a peace deal in Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016.
Michael Semple, an Afghanistan expert at Queen's University Belfast's Institute for the Study of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice, voiced optimism about the peace deal, telling VOA that Hekmatyar can play a positive role in Afghanistan if Hekmatyar distances himself from the political mindset of the 1980s and 1990s and embraces democratic change.
"In the period when Hekmatyar was one of the key stakeholders in Afghanistan, there was no genuine democratic politics; there was no guarantees for the rights of the population; the only way the people were able to conduct their politics was through forces, violence and often through conspiracies. Those are no longer necessary; they no longer offer a way for somebody to advance in politics," Semple added.
To have a positive role in the political future of Afghanistan, Semple says Hekmatyar should "do politics without resorting to force."
Old foes wary
Following the invasion of Afghanistan by the former Soviet Union, Hekmatyar attracted followers across Afghanistan to fight against a Russian-backed regime in the country, but also provoked tough opponents among other militant factions, who repeatedly clashed over territorial control.
In the past 15 years, however, most of the warlords who fought Hekmatyar during the civil war of the 1990s have gained high-ranking positions in the internationally-backed government in Afghanistan. Some of them still oppose him, and objected to signing a peace deal with him.
Lisa Curtis, a South Asia expert at The Heritage Foundation’s Asian Studies Center, says their opposition comes from both their history of animosity, and wariness about the political power he could wield.
"I think it is both: fear and hatred," she said. "Look, the U.S. has enlisted him a specially designated terrorist leader. He has been involved in attacks, involved U.S. casualties. So, this is somebody that has a really very bad track record in the country."
Considering the complexity of political conflict in Afghanistan, she says, the implementation of the peace deal with Hekmatyar will experience ups and downs.
Despite the catastrophic records of warlords such as Hekmatyar in Afghanistan, Curtis believes that the peace deal is a good first step for Afghanistan to gradually rid itself of decades of intractable conflict and move towards stability.
"We should focus on moving Afghanistan beyond its troubled history, which of course includes human rights abuses and inexcusable violence by several different actors," Curtis said, adding that the peace deal could move Afghanistan toward a better future.
Following the fall of the Taliban regime in late 2001, Hekmatyar, then living in self-exile in Iran, apparently returned to Afghanistan, where he opposed both politically and militarily the internationally-backed regime in Afghanistan and on several occasions, claimed responsibility for lethal attacks in Afghanistan.
However, in the past 15 years, the Taliban and its affiliated groups such as the Haqqani Network, were responsible for most of the violence across Afghanistan -- not Hekmatyar’s group.
Given Hekmatyar's comparatively diminished military strength in the past 15 years, Semple from Belfast Queen's University's Institute believes that the peace deal with him is most significant in how it serves as an example for others. He says that if Hekmatyar, a prominent Islamic leader, has joined peace, many could ask why not others -- including the Taliban?
Omar Samad, a U.S.-based former Afghan diplomat who has actively supported the anti-Hekmatyar group Jamiat-Islami, is skeptical about a positive outcome of the peace deal. Like Semple, he argues that Hekmatyar’s next move could have an impact on the viability of broader peace efforts.
"His [Hekmatyar] background is known as a fundamentalist, leading a faction during the Soviet occupation. Then [he] became embroiled in domestic warfare, and then somehow defeated by new forces and became less relevant. This time, there are some indications that he may be more inclined to his ethnic identity to pursue politics," Samad told VOA.
He said in the coming weeks and months, Hekmatyar will show whether he follows his fundamentalist stance or he is reformed and willing to play by the new rules.
Among other western nations, the United States welcomed the peace agreement with Hekmatyar.
"We applaud both parties for seeking a peaceful resolution through political dialogue and negotiation, and we commend the agreement as an important demonstration of the Afghan government’s commitment to restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan," the White House said in a statement.
For now, analysts point to the deal as removing one militant group that had been working against the internationally-backed Afghan government.
"The more conspirators, the more people resorting to force, the more difficult it is to maintain stability in Afghanistan," said Michael Semple.

Why the Colombia peace agreement failed, and what we can expect now
By Katy Collin
October 4, 2016

On Sunday, Oct. 2, Colombian voters unexpectedly rejected the peace agreement between the government and the FARC. Polls just before the vote showed the accord likely to succeed. Instead, it failed by an incredibly thin margin. Thirteen million voters turned out to the polls, and 50.2 percent rejected the agreement.
The government held the vote for the same reason voters rejected the agreement. Although peace is popular, several measures in the peace accord are controversial. Without the legitimization of the referendum, it may have been difficult to implement the peace accord. Given a choice between peace and conflict, Colombian voters have rejected peace. Does this vote mean that peace has failed or that people should never have the chance to vote on such important and polarizing issues?
Is the problem the use of the referendum?
Comparisons are already being drawn between Colombia’s vote and Britain’s referendum on exiting the European Union. Observers conclude that referendums are a dangerous and unpredictable way to make policy. My research indicates that this blanket rejection of direct democracy is too simple.
The best outcome for peace in Colombia may seem like the ratification and implementation of the agreement as it is. But at the same time, pushing ahead with the implementation of an unpopular peace plan is unlikely to build stable peace in the long term. The 2012 Framework Agreement for the Havana negotiations acknowledges that to build peace, there must be widespread support for the process from the Colombian people.
Colombia has a history of failed peace agreements. Sunday’s vote could add the Havana agreement to the list, but that remains to be seen. Colombia may now return to conflict. However, the rejection of the referendum could result in attempts to build a stronger agreement and persuading a larger constituency to support its implementation.
Colombia’s vote cannot be meaningfully compared with referendums held in peace on European Union issues. Referendums held in conflicts to make peace are distinct in their uses, organization and what is at stake. Peacemakers have used referendums with increasing frequency. Sixteen have been planned or held in the past 25 years. The outcomes of these votes are sometimes the consolidation of peace but are also sometimes the freezing of peace, outbreak of violence or a return to open war.
[Colombia just voted down its referendum on peace. Here’s why.]
The parallels to Northern Ireland
A close comparison for Colombia’s vote is Northern Ireland’s 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreements. The vote was held to enact and legitimize a peace agreement negotiated among the elites. The peace process in Northern Ireland brought paramilitaries into the political process and established power-sharing among former adversaries. Northern Ireland’s peace negotiations and referendum transformed a militarized approach to insurgency into shared governance. Colombia’s vote shared each of these characteristics.
The similarity between Northern Ireland’s referendum and Colombia’s is no coincidence. In 1974, while studying in London, Colombia’s President Juan Manuel Santos witnessed an IRA bombing in Piccadilly Circus. Santos followed the peace process in Northern Ireland with interest. In 2011, Santos reached out to Tony Blair’s former chief of staff for tips on peacemaking. The British later provided a team of advisers to the negotiations.
The parallels to Cyprus
Colombia’s peace agreement and referendum were designed to work like Northern Ireland. Instead it has unfolded more like Cyprus, where in 2004 voters rejected the Annan Plan, put forward by former U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan. In Cyprus, the United Nations’ negotiators formulated a plan to reunify the divided island and put together a power-sharing government. Ultimately, leaders in the southern half of the island refused to embrace the deal and campaigned for its rejection. Like Colombia’s rejected peace accord, the Annan Plan proved to be an overreach. It failed to secure buy-in from key constituencies, and people opted to maintain a stable status quo of low-level conflict.
The difficulties with Colombia’s peace deal began in its peace negotiations. Peace negotiations that are open to broad participation are the most successful in yielding agreements that work. Although successful in finding compromises that would entice the FARC to disarm and enter politics, the negotiations in Havana took place far from the influence of Colombian society.
This led to a peace agreement that was supported by the unpopular Santos government and the hated FARC, but was opposed by an array of popular politicians, including the two previous presidents, Álvero Uribe and Anrés Pastrana. In Northern Ireland, one extreme-right party dropped out of negotiations and campaigned against the Good Friday Agreement. Its argument against peace in Northern Ireland was similar to Uribe’s: Terrorists need to be defeated not rewarded. The “no” vote in Northern Ireland was similar to that party’s vote share. The referendum undermined a powerful but ultimately marginal opposition.
Opposition in Colombia is not marginal. As in Cyprus, support for the leadership committed to the peace process was undermined during peace talks. In Cyprus, the chief supporter of peace was voted out of office four months before the referendum. In Colombia, Santos was reelected in 2014. Santos defeated his opponent, aligned with Uribe, with 51 percent of the vote. That vote was seen as an endorsement of Santos’s peacemaking efforts. However, Santos has since become deeply unpopular, polling at only 20 percent approval earlier this year. His 2014 mandate failed to win new support for the peace deal.
Santos and his negotiating team stated before the vote that there is no Plan B. Given the all or nothing approach, Colombians’ voted to preserve the status quo. Cypriots were presented with a similar choice. Southern Cyprus was prosperous, stable and open. The predominantly Greek-Cypriot population had little to gain through a peace deal they viewed as compromised and uncertain. In northern Cyprus, where the Annan Plan passed, the Turkish-Cypriot population would gain access to the European Union and international recognition. A choice between an imperfect peace and the continuation of the status quo was quite different.
In Colombia, the vote against the peace accord also split between those who had little to gain from peace and those who are most effected by conflict. In general, urban centers that have been relatively safe in recent years voted against the plan. The rural periphery most impacted by continued conflict with the FARC voted for peace.
What should we expect going forward?
Santos’s insistence last week that there is no alternative to peace if the referendum failed is already softening. Immediately after the vote, he contacted his negotiating team and requested that they meet with their counterparts in Havana. Both the government and the FARC stated that their cease-fire would continue. Many Colombians rejected the all or nothing approach, saying that a “no” vote did not indicate a preference for conflict but instead a wish for some renegotiation.
In Cyprus, the failure of the Annan Plan ended attempts at peacemaking for a decade. In Northern Ireland, the acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement at the polls did not definitively end paramilitary violence. The peace in Northern Ireland had to be renegotiated several times, and although the government in Belfast was suspended more than once, the conflict in the territory never reverted to militarization and high levels of violence.
The rejection of the referendum in Colombia should not necessarily lead to a rejection of using referendums to make peace. It demonstrates that peacemaking should continue. Peacemakers must do a better job forging an agreement acceptable to both the FARC and Colombians. Santos also needs to build a constituency of supporters by improving the outreach of the process.
In Colombia, the rejection of the referendum will be a failure of peace only if the Cyprus example continues to hold, and the vote ends the peace process. Santos could look again to Northern Ireland, where the commitment to peace had to be sustained long beyond the referendum.

Sessions defends separating immigrant parents and children: ‘We’ve got to get this message out’

June 5, 2018
Attorney General Jeff Sessions delivered a vigorous defense of the hard-line Trump administration policy that has resulted in immigrant children being separated from their parents after crossing the border illegally during a lengthy interview on Tuesday.
Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who admitted he was “disturbed” by the separations, pressed Sessions repeatedly about the morality and necessity of the familial separations. But the attorney general stood his ground.
“If people don’t want to be separated from their children, they should not bring them with them,” Sessions said, echoing some of the remarks he made in May when the Justice Department announced that it would begin to prosecuting every person who crossed the border unlawfully, including many seeking asylum. “We’ve got to get this message out. You’re not given immunity.”
The separation of children from their parents is one of the policy’s outcomes, though President Trump has attempted to blame Democrats for the issue after a slew of outrage and negative reactions in recent weeks. Previously, most families arrested after crossing the border have been released for civil deportation hearings, but because children are not allowed in criminal jails, the new policy is likely to result in a significant uptick in separations.
“I don’t think children should be separated from biological parents at any age, but especially if they’re infants and toddlers,” Hewitt, who is also a contributing columnist for The Washington Post, told Sessions. “I think it’s traumatic and terribly difficult on the child.”
Sessions tried to draw a parallel to how the legal system dealt with American citizens.
“And every time somebody, Hugh, gets prosecuted in America for a crime, American citizens, and they go to jail, they’re separated from their children,” Sessions said.
[Trump’s crackdown on migrant families plunges Washington deeper into immigration fight]
Children whose parents are arrested by immigration officials are transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which attempts to place them with other relatives or foster parents. The agency’s Administration for Children and Families is caring for more than 11,000 unaccompanied children at the moment, and it is averaging about 45 days to place children, a spokesman told NBC. The news outlet reported that a backlog that has developed at the HHS since the new policy was implemented has kept hundreds of children, nearly half of them under the age of 12, in custody at U.S. border stations for more than the limit of 72 hours.
When questioned by Hewitt, Sessions admitted that he had not visited any of the facilities where the children are housed.
“But I believe for the most part they’re well taken care of,” he said. “We need to get this border under control.”
[The U.S. lost track of 1,475 immigrant children last year. Here’s why people are outraged now.]
Hewitt continued to pepper him with questions, asking the attorney general if he could imagine his grandchildren being separated from their parents, if the children had adequate access to legal representation, and if there was a moral right for potential asylum seekers and refugees to be able to navigate the legal system.
“No, I don’t think it’s a moral right, Hugh,” Sessions said. “If you come to the country, you should come through, first, through the port of entry and make a claim of asylum if you think you have a legitimate asylum claim. You shouldn’t try to get across the border at some desert site, some remote site unlawfully and expect not to be promptly deported. We’ve caught, over the years, millions of people, and they’ve been promptly deported. They don’t get trial in federal court.”
[Sessions vows to prosecute all illegal border crossers and separate children from their parents]
Sessions denied that the separation of children from their parents was the goal of the policy. In April, senior immigration officials said that filing criminal charges against migrants, including parents with their children, would be the “most effective” way to stanch illegal border crossings. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly called family separation a “tough deterrent” shortly after the new policy was announced.
Stories of the separations have inflamed immigrant and civil rights groups and many critics on the left.
“This is the worst thing I’ve seen in 25-plus years of doing this civil rights work,” Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s immigrants’ rights project, said on MSNBC recently. “I am talking to these mothers and they are describing their kids screaming, ‘Mommy, Mommy, don’t let them take me away!’ … The medical evidence is overwhelming that we may be doing permanent trauma to these kids, and yet the government is finding every way they can to try and justify it.”
The ACLU is suing the government on claims that the Trump administration has been illegally locking up asylum seekers.

Coral Credit Program
Live corals and marine life are being harvested from their environment in an unregulated manner. These organisms are not easily replaced and are in danger of extinction if this harvesting continues. The WFCRC aims to establish a Coral Credit Program (similar to a “Carbon Credit Program”) by which purchasers of harvested coral and marine life can make a contribution to fund the continuation of our coral conservation efforts. For the purposes of the Coral Credit Program, we will focus on the damage that coral mining, divers/walkers, invertebrates for curio trade, invertebrates for food, and the marine ornamental trade can cause. In many parts of the world, these actions are not regulated, not kept in check. In many of the countries that export reef animals for the curio trade, there is a general lack of regulatory resources to manage the trade. Reefs in general are not able to withstand a prolonged curio trade, and are undergoing a broad array of stresses that are undermining their health and ability to withstand this type of assault.
The World Federation for Coral Reef Conservation (WFCRC) is prepared to be the model for sharing information and best practices for addressing issues that have a direct effect of coral reefs. WFCRC will work closely with dive shops, curio store operators, and independent vendors to facilitate a method by which contributions may be solicited at the point of sale and consumers may immediately purchase coral credits to offset their recent live coral purchase.
Mitigation of Land-based Threat
What is one of the biggest threats to coral reefs? Land-based development. WFCRC aims to educate and inform communities – both coastal and inland – of the dangers and effects of development, erosion, on-land oil spills and other hazards on coral reefs and work closely with stakeholders to help them make data-driven decisions. Alteration of the natural landscape for development and agriculture can have adverse impacts on coral reefs. These cause sediment, nutrients and other pollutants to drain through rivers and streams and enter coastal waters. Once introduced into the marine environment, toxins can accumulate in sediments and remain there for long periods of time. Many metals, like mercury and copper, are extremely toxic and can concentrate in the tissues of organisms. In some cases, toxins can move through food chains and potentially be consumed by humans.
Oil and other petroleum products are also very harmful to coral reef ecosystems. Heavier oils can remain in the marine environment for long periods. If spills occur during low tides or sink to the seafloor, oil can cover and kill corals and other organisms.
This project aims to:
Link patterns of land use within watersheds to the impacts at coral reefs, and identify reefs at greatest risk of degradation
Identify watersheds most vulnerable to erosion and those which contribute the most sediment and pollution to coastal waters
Share information to facilitate improved land management within the region
Use the results of the models and diagnostic tools to educate and encourage key stakeholders to adopt better management practices to reduce impacts on the coastal and marine resources
Standardization of Aquatic Data
The diver participation program and The Standardization of aquatic data. Standardization of aquatic data is a monumental task to encourage conservationist to use the same scale to identify and categorize their observations.
Local island governments are a very large part of this effort. It’s takes an attitude of thinking globally and acting locally. For local business, "going green" is an important aspect of continued success. Projecting future development and meeting infrastructure demands are always difficult. As local governments regularly up date future land-use plans, typically there are no requirements to rezone parcels that could affect downhill geology and/or agricultural runoff that may negatively affect or even kill reefs in proximity. Demands of the country’s infrastructure are increasing without data driven environmental restraints.
As development occurs without understanding the ramification of this development of roads, sewer and water runoff, decline of marine resources will continue, as well as clean water availability. For local knowledge and connections to the island governments an ambassador will be identified and secured for this effort. As a result of this investigation a template or work flow will be realized and can be applied to other island governments in addition to exposing governments to GIS and how they could benefit from making development decisions driven by current data.
The location for the roll out of the first WFCRC dive site will be The Island of St. Martin, followed by St. Barts, Saba, Anguilla and Guadeloupe. Then other islands will be evaluated for The Green Card development using the development template developed on the Island of St. Martin.
We have developed many contacts with local business as well as local officials in St. Martin who are excited about the project as they realize the socioeconomic impact the reef management has on the future development of their island.
Long Term Diver Participation
What does a good decision look like? It’s one where you see results in a timely and meaningful manner. Joining The World Federation for Coral Reef Conservation (WFCRC) to participation is one of those decisions. While worldwide efforts are necessary it is seldom that results are identified in a timely manner, years not life times!
WFCRC is the only nonprofit organization, involved in coral reef decline management, that provides an avenue and an environment in which an individual can make a contribution to an effort that results are realized in real time and can be visualized any time anywhere in the world. It keeps you up today and puts knowledge in your hands via the internet, blogs, alerts and other syndications.
WFCRC’s R.E.E.F.S. (Research Enhancement Engineering for Seascapes) will allow divers and conservationist the access to a geo database that will contain information that has been gathered during a specially designed dive that records coral reef decline data. This geo database will also contain the diver’s personal and diving log that is associated with the data that is gathered. All of the data gather will be via a mobile application especially designed for this program. And will be available for viewing by all members of WFCRC.
That is where WFCRC departs the norm. No longer will diver’s participation end with the dive. Dives become a legend and are recorded for the long term.
WFCRC is requesting your input for a grass roots effort to contact divers and conservationists throughout the world to participate. We are assembling a massive effort to present a truly unique opportunity for divers, etc. to be a team member of a concerned group of people that want to be “really involved” in reef decline management. As a team member you and your effort will be associated with this project into infinity, making your dives legendary.
Our business environmental approach is to have the smallest footprint and make the largest impact. All of our contact with team members will be via email. So our effort will be to create strategic alliances’ with agencies like NOAA, World Resources, The World Bank, Seas, Reef Relief, DAN, dive shops/clubs and anyone involved is providing diving excursions.
Once you have registered with WFCRC and downloaded the mobile application you will be able to access the geo database to enter your information and our observations. This will include your personal and diving profile. With this information being available for all to see, when there is a need for divers with your experience, your name will be available for contact. Or if you just want to stay informed.
This is just one of the ways you are connected to a monitoring site. We have a two tiered approach to offer to divers for their participation in this grass roots effort. We are contacting agencies and individual entities about their research study calendar for activities and studies that our team members might join or be a part of. This educated work force will number in the thousands from intermediate to advanced divers. In the next few years we expect to have contacted over 5,000 divers. Your membership is completely free and there is no cost to you to stay involved.
Once you have decided to make your next dive trip, contact your dive shop or your diving contact and discuss doing a GREEN CARD DIVE. Sit down with them and design a dive that will be recorded and captured in this geo database for future use in deciding what to do about mitigating reef decline.
If your dive shop is not aware of the WFCRC monitoring sites have them to contact us for an up to date list of monitoring sites. We might be able to create new ones with you request.
The first Green Card dive will occur in St. Martin using guidance from local divers and parameters developed with marine biologists. As monitoring begins in St. Martin other surrounding islands will be developed for additional monitoring sits throughout the Caribbean.
This geo database will serve as a dive log for divers. Members will be able to see where the monitoring site that they took pictures of, recorded coral colors, etc., in addition to other information overlaid . They can see if any planned construction is near the site, or even if it’s raining at the site. And they can see all this information on their hand held device, at the site or a thousand miles away. That is where we will use the most current technology in GIS (Geographic Information System) and GPS (Global Positioning System). This is just one way that we are different than any other monitoring efforts. We will share all data gathered, with any interested parties.
So what we are asking is “do ya wanna be really involved in coral reef management? Then complete the volunteer form on the “Be informed” tab as well as the “explanation of your interest”. Your input here will help us to develop the most effective program possible.

Lab-Grown Eggs Spare Women From Dangerous Fertility Drugs
A British woman whose eggs were matured in a lab rather than her body has given birth to healthy twins, marking the UK debut of a procedure that could spare women using assisted reproduction from potentially dangerous fertility drugs.
During in vitro fertilization – IVF, the standard assisted reproduction technique – women take drugs to stimulate egg production and maturation. The eggs are then harvested, fertilized and implanted. The drugs, however, sometimes cause a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which in rare cases can be life-threatening.
During in vitro maturation, or IVM, immature eggs are removed and nurtured in a lab before being fertilized and implanted. Only one dose of fertility drugs is required.
The technique is still immature: the BBC reports that, of two million children born worldwide through IVF, around 400 were produced through IVM; success rates of lab-matured eggs are currently lower than those used in IVF. But for women who are especially sensitive to fertility drugs, or want to freeze eggs for future use, IVM may be a good option.

Easy Access for Patient Appointments
October 21, 2015 by The Western PA Healthcare News Team
A long time grumbling point for patients has always been getting a doctor’s appointment scheduled, according to Mark Kissinger, executive director of Genesis Medical Associates, Inc., the largest still independent primary care physician practice serving the Greater North Hills.
“We have taken the necessary steps through technology to make same day appointments easy,” said Kissinger.
Genesis patients, he noted, can simply go on the new Genesis app and schedule their appointments. No muss, no fuss. They also have the option of just walking in at our new Wexford office located at the Allegheny Health Network Medical Pavilion on Perry Highway. Now, only in its second month of operation, we been delighted with the initial patient response. All Genesis physician offices also have same day appointment hours.”
“Any time you can make things easier for the patient, especially something as simple as scheduling an appointment, you take a lot of stress out of the equation,” said Kissinger.
With 11 offices stretching north from the city of Pittsburgh to Cranberry Township, Genesis Medical Associates, Inc. has also been recognized as a Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO) as a result of its joint venture with Keystone Clinical Partners.
“That ACO contract with Medicare,” he said, “along with the recognition of Genesis as a Patient Centered Medical Home demonstrates the high quality of care with all our physician offices.”

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We are following breaking news this hour. President Trump just announced on Twitter that White House counsel Don McGahn is leaving his position this coming fall. This follows recent revelations that McGahn cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. NPR's Tamara Keith joins us now from the White House.
Tamara, why is Don McGahn stepping down?
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, to hear the president and press secretary Sarah Sanders tell it, you know, he's worked for the president for a long time. Sanders says they have a good relationship and there's nothing else to add. He has done what he set out to do, and he is ready to move on. And the reality is that McGahn has served with Trump since the campaign. He's a campaign finance expert and was part of the Trump campaign doing that work and has now been in this job for almost two years and, in that time, has had incredible success at what his main goal in the job was, which was putting a lot of conservative judges into the federal courts.
MARTIN: Right. I'm just going to read the president's tweet here. He said, White House counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall shortly after the confirmation - in parentheses - (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. So McGahn - in addition to helping with all kinds of judicial nominations, he has been critical in shepherding Kavanaugh through this process, hasn't he?
KEITH: That's right - and also was critical in shepherding Justice Neil Gorsuch through the process. And of course, he's on the Supreme Court now. So you know, Don McGahn can look back at his time in the White House counsel's office and look at the federal judiciary and see that he has made quite an impact in terms of putting conservative judges. People, you know - one of the reasons President Trump was elected is because he put out this list of conservative judges who he said he would appoint to the Supreme Court if he was elected. And that went a long way with evangelical voters who had other concerns about him, about sort of his personal indiscretions. And those voters have gotten what they asked for. And in part, they can thank Don McGahn.
MARTIN: Although the timing is such that it would raise questions about whether or not the president was dissatisfied with the way that McGahn apparently cooperated with Robert Mueller. I mean, based on conversations you've had with people in the White House, was that something that has led to his departure?
KEITH: Not that I have heard. But let's just say what we're talking about here. Reportedly, McGahn spent some 30 hours talking to the special counsel's team over the course of several interviews. And that's a lot of time. Now, he did that because the president's legal team and the White House special counsel who's handling the Russia investigation gave him the green light. They don't believe that they've waived executive privilege. But that's another story.
MARTIN: So this is an important job. Perhaps Americans are more familiar with the name Don McGahn than they have been with any other previous White House counsel. Any idea, at this point, who might replace him?
KEITH: Well, one name that is floating around - and it's really the only name that's floating around - is Emmet Flood. He is currently the White House special counsel. He is a lawyer who has been brought in to handle the Russia investigation for the White House.
MARTIN: In other words, he works for Donald Trump the citizen.
KEITH: No. No, he works for the White House. He is a federal employee. He is - he represents the presidency and the president but not Donald J. Trump the man. But - so he's inside...
MARTIN: So what would this...
KEITH: ...The White House
MARTIN: ...Change indicate?
KEITH: You know, Flood has been more restrictive on executive privilege. He has not wanted as much cooperation as his predecessor in that role.
MARTIN: NPR's Tamara Keith reporting on this news from the White House that White House counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position this fall.
Tamara, thanks very much.
KEITH: You're welcome very much. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.
