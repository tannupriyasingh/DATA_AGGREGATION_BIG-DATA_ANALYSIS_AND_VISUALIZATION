Food Build Deadline
Food Build Deadline
Date: December 1, 2019 - December 15, 2019
Build-Share-Earn
Assured Life Association is sponsoring another Food Build Event this year in conjunction with the National Member Food Drive. This is a way individual members and chapters can earn a minimum of $100 from the home office for their food banks AND involve others in a fun event! So, if you have a food drive, please consider including a Food Build in your event plans. It gets people involved and excited about the event.
Take the cans and boxes of food and other food items collected and build something out of them; like building blocks. Take pictures of your food build throughout the process and one of the final structure and submit those pictures to the home office by December 15, 2019 along with a completed food build form. The food build form can be completed online here.
Step 1. Build-Create a Food Build structure
Step 2. Share-Share pictures of your Food Build with the Home Office
Step 3. Earn-Earn at least $100 for your local food bank
If you include a Food Build in your Food Drive Event, the home office will donate at least $100 to your local Food Bank. Perhaps not as exciting as a contest, but just as effective for local food programs. Everyone that does a Food Build wins! We will share all Food Build entries on our website and blog and through member emails.

Facts on Aging
Per Sherrie Mcgregor, Ph.D. (Everyday Health), the elderly generally show very high interest in associating with friends and close family members. What they show less interest in than younger adults is the expansion of their social networks to make new friends.

Over to you, Liverpool
Bournemouth 0 Manchester City 1

Now let’s see what Liverpool are made of. A fifth straight league victory for Manchester City, courtesy of Riyad Mahrez’s second-half goal, means that Pep Guardiola’s side can enjoy the view from the top of the Premier League table and crank up the pressure on their title rivals, who face Everton today.
At the end of the game, Guardiola went to the City supporters to celebrate with gusto. Punching the air, he knew precisely what this meant. Winning away from home against obdurate opposition in March: it may not linger long in the memory, but as the season reaches its business end, this win could prove highly significant.

“Today is a special moment for all of us,” the manager said. “We made an incredible performance, we didn’t concede one shot on target. They had 11 players in the box, which meant there was no spaces, but somehow we found them.”
He had a point. There was nothing scruffy, nothing lucky about this win. It was a victory forged from patience, application and persistence. Plus total control. City had turned up without Fernandinho. Which is like taking the metronome away from orchestral rehearsal. But his absence did not affect their passing. For most of the first half it was, slick, smooth, sophisticated. And as always their dominance of the ball was underpinned by a refusal to allow their opponents to linger long in possession.
Despite the control, however, end product was at a premium. It did not help that Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe opted for a blanket defence. He selected three centre-backs, one of whom, Jack Simpson, was playing only his second Premier League game.
With Joshua King foraging alone up front, David Brooks darting through midfield and Nathan Ake superb at tidying up alongside his centre-back partners, it was a fine start by Bournemouth, limited as it was in its ambition.

The problem Howe had was that City did not accede to his game-plan. He was hoping to frustrate his visitors, looking to snap them on the break. But City remained patient, taking their lead from Guardiola, who was unusually relaxed on the touchline.
Even though Kevin De Bruyne and John Stones hobbled off either side of the break, such is the depth of their resources nothing seemed to make them falter. More importantly, as the game headed towards stalemate, there was no hint of panic. They kept probing, searching for an opening. Eventually, you felt, there had to be return on all this investment.
It finally came when Oleksandr Zivchenko, having a fine game at left- back, and David Silva worked the ball across the front of the massed ranks of Bournemouth defenders. Silva chested it forward to substitute Riyad Mahrez, whose scuffed right-foot shot deceived Artur Boruc and crept into the net.
If this was meant to signal the start of a landslide, the Bournemouth floodgates remained firmly closed. Bernardo Silva played a pass into Raheem Sterling that was a work of art, but the forward put his shot into the side netting. Sterling then galloped into the area to provide Sergio Aguero with a chance. His effort was well saved by Boruc. And when Vincent Kompany headed the ball forward into Sterling’s path, goal number two seemed inevitable. But Boruc scooped the ball off his toes. It fell to Mahrez, who ballooned a shot comically wide.

Even with Howe enthusiastically clapping his team on, Bournemouth did not produce anything resembling a shot all game.

“Their technical level was so high,” the home manager said. “We were waiting for mistakes and they didn’t make them. It made it very difficult for us.”
As endorsements go, at this point of the season it is one that Guardiola will have enjoyed more than most.

Winslow Towson/ASSOCIATED PRESS
Seeking to run against US Sen. Elizabeth Warren, John Kingston waves during the Massachusetts Republican Convention at the DCU Center in Worcester, Mass., in April.
By Matt Stout Globe Correspondent May 31, 2018
US Senate candidate John Kingston said he wants to “get this party started” — but those in his own party aren’t getting an invite.
One of three Republicans vying to face US Senator Elizabeth Warren in November, Kingston said Wednesday he is launching a $500,000 media campaign that will include ads on the radio — and potentially, television — into early July.
But, in those advertisements, Kingston said he does not intend to focus on his current opponents —state Representative Geoff Diehl or longtime GOP official Beth Lindstrom — both of whom are also running in the Sept. 4 primary.

“People will recognize in the general election, when we get there, that Elizabeth Warren is the embodiment of what’s wrong with Washington right now. She’s the most divisive politician that’s on the ticket for an election this cycle,” Kingston told reporters after a campaign event at Carrie Nation in Boston, where he spoke to about two dozen people, including family.

And, he was asked, what about his primary opponents?
“I’ll let you draw your own conclusions,” he said. “You know I’m running against Elizabeth Warren. That’s what we’re working on.”
The strategy to home in on the opposing incumbent, even in a competitive primary, is not new. Diehl and Lindstrom both repeatedly frame themselves in terms of their ability to oust Warren.
Kingston, who’s poured more than $4 million of his own money into the campaign, is just the first to launch a major ad campaign in the race, with plans, he said, to “absolutely” continue on the air into the summer. He intends to pitch himself as a Republican bridge-builder in the vein of Wednesday’s message: “Elizabeth Warren is committed to fighting. I am committed to working.”

The largely self-funded, first-time candidate telegraphed the move earlier this month when his campaign, in slashing staff salaries and fees to advisers, said it intended to pivot to the airways in his bid for the Republican nomination.
“It’s time to get this party started,” he said of the ad buy, “and get the message out to people.”

Are you looking for the best Medigap insurance in Garfield, AR? We can help you find affordable and quality Medicare Supplemental Insurance in Arkansas. You can either call 888-602-5343 or enter your Zip Code above and fill out the form. We will help you find the best Garfield, AR Medigap insurance options.
Buying Medigap, or Medicare Supplemental Insurance, is the key for many people over age 65 to be able to afford to use their Medicare coverage. Medigap is a separate policy that is sold by private insurance carriers that adhere to Arkansas laws.
For the most part, Medigap covers co-insurance, co-payments, and even includes medical coverage if faced with an emergency when traveling outside of the United States. Older Medigap plans also covered deductibles, though those were mostly phased out in 2010. Medigap covers costs seen in Medicare Part A and Part B Plans. Medicare Advantage plans are also available though not in conjunction with Medigap benefits. Likewise, be aware that it is illegal to sell a Medigap holder Medicare Savings plans.
The reason people in Garfield, AR buy Medigap is to cover where an individual’s money will fall short. Buying a Medigap policy will require monthly premiums in addition to Part A and Part B Plan premiums. Though, the fact is that there are still ways to save on Medigap coverage.
For one, apply for policies while in the first 6 months of your Medicare Part and Part B plan policies. During this period, guarantee issuance is extended to anyone over the age of 65 within the first six months. It means that there are no denials or increases in premiums because of pre-existing conditions, based upon past medical history, or current medical problems that spring up.
If an individual waits they may pay higher rates and fees for extending past the deadline. It is better to shop around and compare quotes and do so during the open enrollment period. The majority of Medigap insurance plans are standard and demarcated by letters A through N. Each plan covers benefits but have added benefits. For instance, part D covers prescriptions.
Some plans are decommissioned already, and others are set for being phased out by 2020. Fortunately, the unavailable policies are not marketed any longer. And, if you were concerned that you are missing, know that most of the old plans are actually more expensive because the policies have fewer subscribers than today’s active plans.
That means that while cheap Medicare Supplemental Insurance plans A through G charge higher premiums, costs that are out-of-pocket are not as expensive as for Plan K through Plan N. Those carry lower premiums and like benefits but at the trade-off of costing more at the time of service.
Employer Retiree Benefits
The next way to save money beyond following the open enrollment dates is to find out if a former or present employer has a Medigap policy of its own. In general, these will be less costly than an individual policy that you buy on your own. Though, the warning and word to the wise is to carefully consider if the company is financially stable or not.
Determining Eligibility
Whenever purchasing many types of Medicare plans, you actually cancel the old policy before instating the new policy. That is not the case where Medicare A and B are concerned. The reason, recall, is that cheap Medigap insurance plan is meant to fill the gaps of conventional original Medicare policies.
It requires still being covered under Medicare. The other benefit is to know when shopping around that the policies are the same whether you buy with Humana or Aetna or BlueCross BlueShield, for instance.
What is worth looking at is the reputation of the health insurance company, the quality of the coverage they offer, and the credit worthiness rating of the insurance company. The reason to look at the credit worthiness of the company offering up the insurance is to ensure that they are likely to have the money to pay out benefits and claims as agreed in the policy paperwork.
In addition to looking for insurance carriers that have an A or greater rating in the creditworthiness area, it is important to find out about the customer service and the customer satisfaction ratings of the companies you are comparing as well. It pays to have the company that pays claims within a timely manner, without a heroic effort on your part or the part of your doctors.
Otherwise, you will spend time having to contact the Arkansas insurance department or commissioner to file official complaints to get the claims paid within the acceptable two-month window. All of the Plan C Medigap coverage will be the same as that same plan from another insurer. Look at service quality and price. Look at comparing insurance company offerings to locate a cheap medicare supplement insurance plan in Garfield, AR .
You will also need to look for separate prescription drug coverage, which is designated by Medicare Part D. This will add in an additional premium in addition to other costs. The key is that the majority of people who qualify for cheap medicare supplemental insurance are 65 and older, and look for their Medigap during open enrollment.
In addition , the other requirements stipulate Medicare Part B and Part A participants are eligible. Once you choose a low cost Medicare Supplemental insurance policy it is as if it is written in stone and can not be altered.
To be eligible for cheap Medicare Supplemental insurance plans in Garfield, AR apply for coverage offered by insurers within your state. All policies are available in each state, though most states will have one single policy available for Medicaid plan holders.
Everyone at age 65 and older and who is also enrolled in the Medicare Parts A and B is eligible to purchase a supplemental plan. It is advisable to decide on a plan during the 6 months of open enrollment to pay the most favorable policy premiums. When comparing costs during the open enrollment, it means pre-existing conditions are not factored into the pricing for the premiums. It is the hands-down best way to save money on a Medigap Supplemental plan in Garfield, AR .
Always find out the Arkansas laws prior to shopping. They can vary a bit, though it is important to recall that the policies are uniform across states.

Montague
(That afternoon, on the outskirts of Verona, at a Club, getting in an afternoon’s worth of pheasant shooting, having needed to get out of town and “think about things;” although presently eating peanuts and breaking at the bar… Capulet is also there.)
O Capulet, you bastard, have you heard?
Your daughter has popped out a little bird.
I heard it through “The Grapevine” from my wife
who’s been a member of that Club for life.
You know the way the women gossip, Cap.
I don’t know what I’m filled with. Is it sap?
and sentiment. I hear my son now works
in Mantua, a landscaper. He forks
the soil with a hooking thing. With paint
he brushes canvas, in spare time. They’re quaint,
these landscapes that he recreates, the trees;
he always loved the sycamores, the seas,
the skies like fields of lavender and suns
like oranges and lemons: fruity ones.
Capulet
Of course I’ve heard, you heathen; it’s a boy.
My wife, as well, is of that vine, deploy
your family, fellow. We will have a fête.
We have to end this puerile, savage hate
and get along— I guess they’re doing well.
Julie, at first, I guess she cooked like hell;
but now she cooks a mean pesto and fish.
My wife, herself, has never cooked a dish;
and though your son has always been a queer,
a weirdo, an eccentric; I don’t fear
that he will hurt her any longer. Yes,
his paintings are top-notch; they sell, I guess,
which supplements his income potting plants.
It’s not a bad life wearing denim pants.
Montague
I totally agree; I can’t believe
they named him what they named him. Let us leave
for Mantua tomorrow smoke a stoge
with Romeo, who once was such a rogue,
conspiring with that old foge to ’nap
your lovely daughter. I am sorry Cap.
I hope we can get over this impasse
and see the motes in our eyes too, alas!
We did not do a hell of a clean job
at raising kids and families. We did rob
them of their Christian virtues. Neighbors love
to bash their neighbors. It’s condemned above.
We have to turn a new leaf. Let’s begin
to start forgiving. We have lived in sin.
Capulet
I know; I know; I’m getting over it.
I miss my pretty daughter who would sit
upon my lap when she was small. I would
convey to her sweet stories. Oh we should
collect our wives, compose a caravan,
and get to Mantua as fast as can
be done succinctly, end this whole charade
of feignéd ire on our parts. The rod
I snap and toss. Our kids are grown adults
despite the fact they jumped the córral. Colts
who deigned to feign my Juliet’s demise.
We put her in the grave. I cried my eyes
out of their sockets. It was a sick prank;
but like you’ve said, it was our fault: We stank.
Lady Montague
(The next morning, rather early, after Montague and Capulet have returned to Verona and have rendezvoused with their wives at a chic breakfast place.)
We’ll have the fête when we return; let’s go.
I cannot wait to hold my grandkid, show
him off to everyone I see and meet:
It is the Grandma’s job to be the seat
of irksomeness and bothersome concern.
She thinks her grandkid’s all there is, will burn
with jealousy if there is a young tot
who outdoes hers, is potty-trained, sans snot,
while hers increases Huggies Wall Street stock,
and doesn’t talk but only goes “bawk bawk.”
So, my dear Lady Capulet, prepare
to show Mercutio off everywhere…
It’s forty something kilos to their flat.
Pheidippides could run it. Think of that!
Lady Capulet
(The morning after that, having traveled thirty kilos the first day, having rested themselves and their horses at an Inn, and the final fourteen kilos the next morning, the two grandmother’s barge through the door to find the three exiled Mantuans—Romeo, Juliet, and little Mercutio—all still in bed together. Montague and Capulet follow behind the women demurely.)
O! O my God! O! O my God! O! O!
O! Juliet, my love! O Romeo!
We’re sorry, darlings, miss you, love you, yes!
(To Capulet): “Their flat is such a mess…”
It’s been so long! We’ve missed you ever since—
O where is he? O where’s the little prince!
Please hand him over, Juliet, my love!
O look at him! Just like a little dove!
The peaceful lad, who’s bringing peace as well
to our two families whose lives were a hell…
I’ve got him, darling. Let me kiss his lip!
(I can’t believe you bare your budding nip!)
That’s so progressive, Jewish, peasant-like,
but good for you! He is a healthy tyke!
Lord Montague
(Looking embarrassed, shakes Romeo’s hand, who has quickly thrown on some sweats, and the three men, including Lord Capulet, go outside on the small balcony to smoke a cigar…)
Congratulations, Romeo, my son.
As you must know, this hasn’t been much fun.
You’ve always had an all or nothing bent.
You wanted once to make your home a tent;
you burned your money, went out on a trip,
and when I tried to stop you, gave me lip.
You’re hot; you’re cold; you’re tense; you’re lax. I love
you nonetheless. I thank the Lord above.
I must admit I was rather the same.
I was distracted ere I found my dame.
I’d exercise and go and run a mile;
I’d cycle, swim, and it would make me smile.
But the next week, my smiles full of sags,
You’d see me idling and smoking fags.
Romeo
(picking the dead petals off of the potted flowers pensively and dropping them down onto the street)
The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree;
for here we are, smoking cigars, us three.
O let us turn a new leaf in our book.
Quit nagging on each other let us look
at our own selves and try to change at last.
I do not want to think about the past.
I want to press my weight against the plow
and keep on plowing. I don’t need you now.
I know that we can make it on our own.
Given the choice, Mantua’s now my home.
I’ve bled here, sweat here; here my family is:
here is my occupation. Mind your biz
and I’ll mind mine. I love you still; but do
please pluck the Past’s black petal it is through.

I agree with Kathy F. You should definitely keep doing these takes on Shakespeare. Maybe a whole play! Your iambic pentameter is a pleasure to read, engaging and entertaining. One of my favorite lines, quite chuckly-worthy:
“We’re sorry, darlings, miss you, love you, yes!
(To Capulet): “Their flat is such a mess…”
This is great stuff, Reid–

Beautifully written piece making clever use of the vernacular. Reminiscent of C.J. Dennis’ style in an Australian comical take on Romeo and Juliet from early last century, entitled “The Play.”

Lew Icarus Bede June 4, 2017
Mr. McGrath, this is a remarkable piece, with an interesting vantage—predominantly from the grandparents’ points of view, in which you neatly capture generational tension. The diction is snappy and rich, “Pheidippides could run it. Think of that.” Your humour, like that of C. J. Dennis, is Falstaffian. David Watt’s critical observation is brilliant. “The Play” is an extr’ordinary poem. Both McGrath now and Dennis then, a century ago, handle iambic pentametre couplets with consummate skill. I’m also very much impressed with the stanzaic form Dennis used in “The Play,” the fourth line dimetre contrast with the iambic pentametres. I look forward to more work from Mr. McGrath and David Watt as well.

Thank you all for your kind words. I have not read “The Play” but I will certainly look into it as soon as possible. Perhaps there will be more adaptations in the future.

the now and then
if you do a third one
I’d read the first two again!

Valentine’s day: Things to do within your budget
by Ofodu Ifunanya · Published February 12, 2018 · Updated February 21, 2018
We all know that Valentine’s day is around the corner and some people already have their hearts racing. Hopefully it’s because of the joy and happiness Valentine’s day brings but we all know that’s not true. Not everyone is too excited about that day. In fact, some people are scared, really scared, ready-to-skip-town scared and already having panic attacks all because of Valentine’s day.
Valentine’s day is that one special day that could literally drill a hole through your bank account. Just thinking about it could give you nightmares, let alone attempting to fill that hole. I know 7 ways you could have a lovely, romantic Valentine’s day celebration without breaking your pocket. So, get ready because Valentine’s day is about to rock.
1. Indoor Movie Night
Maybe you haven’t planned for Valentine or you’re really low on cash. You can do movie night with almost anything you have. Get a good movie, popcorn, pizza and maybe even a bottle of wine. Spice it up a little and enjoy a good movie.
2. Valentine’s Chef
If that special person in your life loves to eat home cooked meals, go out of your way and prepare a three course meal for lunch or dinner. If you can, spice it up with candle light and sweet music. It’ll most likely have a light effect on your account and it’ll be totally worth it.

3. Photo Albums
Say you both love pictures and you already have some good memories frozen in time. Try getting those pictures printed and made into a photo book/album. If you can’t afford this, you can still create a soft copy album. There are many photo apps out there that can get this done for free.
4. DIY’s
My personal favorite. Most times the gift isn’t just in the outcome of the hard work. It’s in the hard work itself, the time and care taken to craft something special. If you don’t know how to or what to make, here‘s a link to something you can try. Just don’t make anything crappy. It’ll ruin the fun.
5. Sugar Treats
Buying sweet something for someone with sweet tooth would put a smile on that face. Going out of your way to make it, could earn you a get-out-of-jail card. There are lots of things you could try. From cakes, cookies, muffins, cake pops and tarts to hot chocolate and ice cream. The list goes on and on.
6. Game Time
In a case where you’re both game lovers, be it cards, video games, outdoor games or board games. You already have your valentine problem solved. You don’t even need to stress on this one. Pick out a game you both love and play till your hearts’ content.

7. Shop Online
Picking the right gift for Valentine’s day could be somewhat tedious and financially disturbing. Online stores have already fixed that problem. This year, online stores are offering outrageous discounts on Valentine worthy gifts. So shop online with zero headaches and a smile. This should be the icing on the cake.

With all these, you have no excuse to ditch Valentine’s day. So, if you haven’t started making plans, start now. You’ve got two days till Valentine’s day. Good luck.!

Possible New Depression Treatment Using Psychedelics
Oct 24, 2017 | Uncategorized | 0 |
Those suffering from severe depression do not always respond to traditional treatment. Researchers are always seeking alternate ways to help alleviate symptoms of depression. A new study using psilocybin (the active ingredient in hallucinatory mushrooms) shows promise as a possible treatment for patients with depression.
Types of Extreme Treatment
Antidepressant medication, cognitive behavior therapy, and diet alteration are just a few methods prescribed to help treat depression. When symptoms are extreme or there just isn’t enough time to wait for meds to kick-in, some patients opt for Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). This procedure is performed with muscle relaxers and anesthesia. Electrodes are placed on the patient’s scalp, which then deliver a controlled electric current to the brain. A brief seizure ensues, jolting the brain, but not the rest of the body.
Another treatment is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS.) A device is held above the patient’s head to create a magnetic field in the brain. A light electrical signal is applied to the prefrontal cortex. This technique is centered on kick-starting the region of the brain that is connected to mood.
It’s High Time!
The new study out of Imperial College London used “magic mushrooms” based on a similar philosophy of treatment. The concept is to “reset” the brain-circuit activity that plays a role in depression.
Out of 20 patients who participated in the study, 19 showed relief from depression symptoms—up to five weeks after treatment. None of the participants had responded to other traditional treatments previously. Their brains scans before and after treatment showed clear changes in brain activity.
The researchers noted that it’s a temporary fix, but the psilocybin gave the patients the kick-start their brains needed to escape from the depressive state. Patients would still need to continue with other therapies, but the instant brain reset is what excited the researchers the most about the experimental treatment. They also warned that no one should attempt to self-medicate using psilocybin.
In the Meanwhile…
There needs to be more clinical trials using psychoactive drugs in order to establish more successful data. Also, the trial groups need to be much larger. In early 2018, a trial will begin that will examine the use of psilocybin versus a leading antidepressant. That should be interesting.
In the meanwhile, if you are concerned you may be suffering from depression, do not hesitate to seek help. You can call your doctor, talk to a friend, a loved one, and/or check online for helpful resources. The CDC has an informative page to help answer questions: https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/resources.htm

FAQ About Codeine
Q) What is Codeine?
A) Codeine is a member of the drug class opiates. Opiates include all naturally occurring
drugs with morphine-like effects such as codeine and all semi and fully synthetic drugs with morphine-like effects such as heroin and meperidine (Demerol).
Codeine was first discovered as a natural constituent of opium in very small concentrations, in the range of 0.7% - 2.5% by weight. Most codeine found in pharmaceutical products today is synthetically produced via the methylation of morphine.
Q) How is Codeine used?
A) Codeine can be administered orally (PO), subcutaneously (SC), intramuscularly (IM) and rectally (PR). Codeine cannot be safely administered by an intravenous (IV) injection as it may result in pulmonary oedema, facial swelling, dangerous release of histamines, and various cardiovascular effects. It cannot be administered intranasally (snorting). Codeine free base can be smoked on the aluminum foil ("chasing the dragon") similarly to smoking heroin.
Q) What are the effects of Codeine addiction?
A) Codeine is absorbed quickly from the GI tract and it's first pass through the liver results in very little loss of the drug. This contrasts with morphine in which over 90% of the drug is metabolized in the first pass through the liver resulting in a considerable loss of potency when administered orally.
Narcotics induce an "opioid analgesia" by altering the perception of pain at the spinal cord and brain. They also affect emotional responses to pain. Opioids have stimulating effects as well because they block inhibitory neurotransmitters. Repeated use of these drugs can cause long-term changes in the way the nervous system functions.

runny nose
sweating
muscle twitching
muscle pain
headaches
irregular heartbeat
nausea and vomiting
high blood pressure
fever
insomnia
dehydration
yawning

Q) What is Codeine addiction?
A) Addiction is a major risk with prolonged use (over 2-3 weeks) of narcotics. Even moderate doses of some narcotics can result in a fatal overdose. When increasing doses of narcotics, the person may first feel restless and nauseous and then progress to loss of consciousness and abnormal breathing. Other risks include withdrawal symptoms that may last for months.
Addictive drugs activate the brains reward systems. The promise of reward is very intense, causing the individual to crave the drug and to focus his or her activities around taking the drug. The ability of addictive drugs to strongly activate brain reward mechanisms and their ability to chemically alter the normal functioning of these systems can produce an addiction. Drugs also reduce a persons level of consciousness, harming the ability to think or be fully aware of present surroundings.

Maarten Bot
Hotelbeds Group announced today the appointment of Maarten Bot as the new Sales Manager for Retail Continental Europe, Greece and Turkey for the Group’s Ancillary Bank – working with retail clients.
Hotelbeds Group’s Ancillary Bank distributes ancillary products (excursions, event tickets, theme parks, cruises and car rental products) to retail travel agents, wholesalers, tour operators, airlines, online travel agencies, hotel industry partners, activity providers, tourism boards and other points of sale.
Maarten Bot, who has more than seven years of experience in the sales industry, had previously worked as a Senior Sales Executive at Bedsonline for the Dutch market (The Netherlands and Flanders). As part of this move, he has been relocated to the Group’s headquarters in Palma (Spain) and will become part of a growing team for the European Ancillary Bank Sales team that is led by Peter Jones, the Head of Sales for Europe.
In his new role, Maarten will be responsible for Ancillary Bank’s sales and business development for the retail business in the following markets: France, Belgium, Netherlands, DACH countries (Switzerland, Germany and Austria), Poland, Greece and Turkey.
Peter Jones, Head of Sales Europe at Hotelbeds Group Ancillary Bank, commented “We are glad to welcome Maarten to our Ancillary Bank Europe sales team. The previous experience of Maarten in our retail division of Bedsonline will be key for our team.

I am sure his knowledge and enthusiasm will help us grow and develop the sale of ancillaries within our extended retail client portfolio.”

Lin-Manuel Miranda Says Good-bye to 'Hamilton'... and to His Long Hair
Getty Images
Lin-Manuel Miranda took his final bows as the star of his history-making (and history-remaking!) musical "Hamilton" on Saturday, Us Weekly reports.
The star remained silent through multiple standing ovations at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in NYC, where the show transferred from the Public Theater in August 2015. It has been consistently sold out from its Off-Broadway debut, winning acclaim and 11 Tonys.
Video of the curtain call posted by the production on Facebook logged over a million views overnight.
The performance — also the last for stars Leslie Odom Jr. and Phillipa Soo — included numerous luminaries in the audience: Jennifer Lopez, Spike Lee, Jane Fonda, Rosie O'Donnell, Charlie Rose, Mariska Hargitay, and Secretary of State John Kerry.
According to Us, Miranda skipped the usual stage-door exit, instead appearing on a balcony over the marquee holding an umbrella in the rain and his hand over his heart as a silent tribute to his supporters. He had tweeted, "Okay see you on the marquee. Now." as a heads-up.

Miranda's final word on the evening was a bold act — he cut off his long hair! On Twitter, he shared a black-and-white photo of his severed locks, along with the caption, "Teach 'em how to say goodbye...".

Dispute Over 3D-Printed Guns Raises Many Legal Issues
Dispute Over 3D-Printed Guns Raises Many Legal Issues
admin August 1, 2018 Weapons No Comments
A little-known dispute over 3D-printed guns has morphed into a national legal debate in the last week, drawing attention to a technology that seems a bit of sci-fi fantasy and — to gun-control advocates — a dangerous way for criminals to get their hands on firearms that are easy to conceal and tough to detect.
The gun industry calls the outcry an overreaction that preys on unwarranted fears about a firearm that can barely shoot a round or two without disintegrating.
It also raises a host of constitutional questions involving First Amendment protections for free speech and Second Amendment rights to own guns.
Here are some questions and answers about the debate.
Q. What is behind the dispute?
A. Cody Wilson, the founder of Texas-based Defense Distributed, first posted downloadable blueprints for a handgun called the Liberator that could be made using a 3D printer in 2013. Within days it had been downloaded about 100,000 times until the State Department ordered him to cease, contending it violated federal export laws since some of the blueprints were saved by people outside the United States.
The dispute between Wilson and the federal government went on for years until this past June when they reached a settlement that paved the way for Wilson to resume posting the designs.
The State Department decision came amid an obscure administrative change — begun under the Obama administration — in how the weapons are regulated and administered. Military grade weapons remain under the purview of the State Department, while commercially available firearms fall under the Commerce Department. The settlement with Wilson determined that 3D-printed firearms are akin to more traditional firearms that aren’t subject to State Department regulations.
Wilson resumed sharing his blueprints for the gun the day the settlement went into effect last week.
Ben Chalker shows the CAD software of a 3D-printable gun called the Liberator in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018.
​Q. Why does Wilson want the authority to post the designs on his website?
A. Wilson calls it a First Amendment issue. He believes the First Amendment gives him a constitutional right to disseminate the code to make a gun with a 3D printer.
“This is a very, very, very easy First Amendment question that I think people might be hesitant to accept because it involves guns and people don’t like guns,” said his lawyer, Josh Blackman.
And Wilson has a strong legal claim that distribution of the information is different than actually making an all-plastic firearm.
While it is a violation of the federal Undetectable Firearms Act to make, sell or possess a firearm that can’t be detected by magnetometers or metal detectors, what Wilson is doing is simply providing the information on how to make such a firearm.
“What Defense Distributed was doing was not making and then shipping the weapons overseas,” said Chuck James, a former federal prosecutor who is now a private lawyer with the Washington, D.C.-area firm of Williams Mullen. “They were making the data available on the web where it would be available to someone overseas.”
​Q. What kind of gun designs are available on the website?
A. Defense Distributed shows a variety of designs. The code for a 3D-printed gun is for what he calls the Liberator, which gets its name from a pistol American forces used during World War II.
His design includes a metal firing pin and a metal block. His site also includes blueprints to make various AR-platform long guns and some other handguns using more traditional means and materials.
Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., left, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Ct., display a photo of a plastic gun on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 31, 2018. Democrats are calling on President Donald Trump to reverse an administration decision to allow a Texas company to make blueprints for a 3D-printed gun available online.
Q. Are 3D-printed guns legal?
A. In 1988, the U.S. enacted the Undetectable Firearms Act, making it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess a firearm that couldn’t be detected by a metal detector. That law has been renewed several times by Congress and remains in effect.
If 3D-printed guns contain enough metal to be flagged by a metal detector, they are considered legal under U.S. law.
Gun-control advocates argue that the risks are too great to allow 3D-printed guns because even if they’re designed to include metal, it’s too easy for someone to not include those pieces or to remove them to skirt detection.
“It’s an absurdity. You can take the piece of metal out and put it back in at your own whims and you can take it out and walk through a metal detector undetected,” said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety.
Q. How well do 3D-printed guns work?
A. Gun experts and enthusiasts recoil at the suggestion that a 3D-printed gun is a true threat, calling the firearms mere novelties.
Unlike traditional firearms that can fire thousands of rounds in their lifetime, 3D-printed guns are notorious for usually lasting only a few rounds before they fall apart. They don’t have magazines that allow the usual nine or 15 rounds to be carried; instead, they usually hold a bullet or two and then must be manually loaded afterward. And they’re not usually very accurate either.
A video posted of a test by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2013 showed one of the guns produced from Wilson’s design — the Liberator — disintegrating into pieces after a single round was fired.
“People have got this Star Trek view” of the guns being futuristic marvels, said Chris Knox, communications director for The Firearms Coalition, a gun-rights group. “We’re not talking about exotic technology.”
Others are quick to point out that normal guns are readily available in the U.S. with little regulation, making 3D-printed guns a major hassle compared with regular weapons.
Q. What’s the status of the debate?
A. A federal judge on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order blocking Wilson from continuing to post the designs on his site. A hearing is to be held in that case next week.
In the meantime, President Donald Trump criticized the Department of Justice advising the State Department to reach a settlement with Wilson without first consulting with him.
Wilson’s website currently displays a banner asking people to help “to uncensor the site.” Clicking a link directs the person to a page to pay membership dues ranging from $5 a month to $1,000 for a lifetime.

Freedom of Information Act Requests and the War on Terror
October 19, 2011	
Huaou Yan
It looks like October will be a bad month for those of us hoping for a little more government transparency in the War on Terror. As Billy Corriher of this blog has already noted, in the context of the secret OLC memo justifying the assassination of Anwar al-Aulaqi, that it would be unfair to criticize the OLC without having actually seen its legal reasoning. However, it is also worth nothing that this month has also seen two important developments in how we might get to (or not get to) see what the government is actually doing.
It began with the New York Times’s suit against the Department of Justice for failing to turn over documents pertaining to the government’s “secret” interpretation of the PATRIOT act. According to the complaint, filed on the 5th, the DOJ had denied several New York Times’s Freedom of Information Act requests under 5 USC § 552(b)(1), the FOIA exception pertaining to classified foreign policy and national defense information. However, the New York Times is contending that the DOJ could have redacted any classified information and released the public information as opposed to denying the FOIA request wholesale.
Meanwhile, on the same day the New York Times complaint was being filed, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York was releasing a thirty page opinion finding the CIA not liable for civil contempt after failing to honor Freedom of Information requests submitted eight years ago: in 2003, the ACLU submitted FOIA requests for CIA videotapes of its interrogation sessions, including those involving “enhanced interrogation techniques.” On September 14th of 2004, Judge Hellerstein ordered the CIA to produce the materials in question, only to find that the CIA, under increasing investigatory pressure, had destroyed all of the tapes. The ACLU then filed a motion to find the CIA liable for civil contempt. Now, seven years later, the same Judge Hellerstein argues that holding the CIA liable for monetary damages “would serve no beneficial purpose,” and that the CIA’s failure has been remedied by providing written records of the contents of the tape and improving internal agency protocol for the retention of records.
Now, I agree that the government’s job, fighting a stateless enemy, is not an easy one, but when we cannot know what they are doing, because we are barred even from their interpretation of what the law says and because they are not penalized for defying the law to keep us in the dark, well, that’s a problem.

Open Road Tolling For New York By the End of 2017
All around the New York City area and slightly north, toll booths are being removed and replaced with electronic cashless tolling. This means that anyone entering or leaving New York City in their own vehicle will need to have an E-ZPass in their vehicle to pass through these “tolls.” Passing through these tolls without an E-ZPass will create a fine to be paid for your vehicle. These will not be small fines and will be strictly enforced once all of the cashless tolling is fully installed.
This step up in modernization will greatly help the flow of traffic, the burning of fuel and commuter travel time. Governor Cuomo hopes to have this in place by the end of 2017.
This is also the beginning of a major plan to rebuild and renovate New York’s airports, roads, bridges and an expansion of the Javits Convention Center. So watch out world…New York is getting a make-over!

Ross worm (Sabellaria spinulosa) reefs
Ross worms build tubes from sand and shell fragments. The worms are usually found individually, but in some shallow water areas they are found in colonies. The tubes of large numbers of the worms can form reefs, which at their largest can be about half a metre in height and cover an area of several hectares. Ross worms require a good supply of sand grains for tube-building, and so like murky water.
These worm-built reefs are important because they provide a habitat for a wide range of other seabed-dwelling animals. A greater variety of marine life is found associated with ross worm reefs than on other similar areas of the seabed. Where they occur on the soft seabed, they are of particular significance for nature conservation. By providing a complex seascape with hard surfaces and nooks and crannies in an otherwise flat, featureless seabed, they provide a home for animals which would not normally be found there.
The greatest impact on this habitat is thought to be physical disturbance from fishing activities. Dredging for oysters and mussels, trawling for shrimp or finfish, net fishing and potting can all cause physical damage to these reef communities. While the reefs appear to recover well from minor damage, serious impacts from mobile fishing gear break the reefs down into small pieces.
Aggregate dredging often takes place in areas of mixed sediment where ross worm reefs may occur, but the effects of this on the reefs are being investigated. Ross worms appear to be very tolerant of pollution.
For the official habitat definition please see the documents listed below.
European distribution
Given its few key requirements, and its tolerance of poor water quality, ross worms are common in the north-east Atlantic. Distinct reefs (as opposed to low crusts on the seabed) have been recorded from much of the British Isles (although few in Scottish waters) as well as off the coasts of France and Germany. They are absent from the Baltic Sea.
Conservation status/need
This is a UK BAP Priority Habitat (BAP habitats are now Habitats of Principal Importance/Priority Habitats).
OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species and Habitats (Region II – North Sea, Region III – Celtic Sea)
Listed in Annex 1 of the Habitats Directive: Reefs, and as a feature of Sandbanks which are covered by seawater at all time; Large shallow bays and inlets; and Estuaries.

Huntsville Long Term Care Insurance
Frequently included in benefits offered by today’s top employers, long term care insurance has become a necessary part of a comprehensive insurance package for many employees. Of course, an employer and company is there to make a profitable business. McBride Benefit Solutions offers free quotes from a range of carriers that allow Huntsville companies to get the best rates that fit their business and group health plan objectives.
Extra Health Coverage
Long term care insurance provides assistance that goes beyond disability coverage when a person is unable to carry out regular daily activities following an accident or illness. Expenses for prolonged care are not always fully covered by Medicaid, or in many cases, private health insurance. Insurance for extended care ensures a reasonable quality of life in the event of a prolonged health problem and a clear reduction in financial stress.
McBride Benefit Solutions Long Term Care Programs
Unfortunately, serious illnesses or accidents can happen without warning and affect an employee’s ability to generate an income. McBride Benefit Solutions insurance specialists offer practical solutions that include a range of payment options available to employees as well as enhanced coverage that includes additional health services.
Flexible Payment Options and Other Benefits
Depending on the needs and goals of your Huntsville business, long term care insurance that is offered to employees on a voluntary basis as part of a larger benefits package, also provides appealing tax benefits to employers and helps to attract top quality personnel. By offering an enhanced form of health coverage not found in basic medical or disability insurance plans, benefits can be extended to include spouses or dependents which will ultimately improve productivity allowing employees to better manage circumstances that require long term care solutions.
Consult with McBride Benefit Solutions experts to learn more about premium discounts for long term care insurance that positions you as a Huntsville business that truly cares for its employees.
We will listen attentively to your requirement and concerns, explain every option to your satisfaction and then compare possible plans so you get exactly the coverage you need.

MICHAEL GRUBER
I was born and raised in New York City, and educated in its public schools. I went to Columbia, earning a BA in English literature. After college I did editorial work at various small magazines in New York, and then went back to school at City College and got the equivalent of a second BA, in biology. After that I went to the University of Miami and got a masters in marine biology. In 1968-69 I was in the U. S. Army as a medic.
In 1973, I received my Ph.D. in marine sciences, for a study of octopus behavior. Then I was a chef at several Miami restaurants. Then I was a hippie traveling around in a bus and working as a roadie for various rock groups. Then I worked for the county manager of Metropolitan Dade County, as an analyst. Then I was director of planning for the county department of human resources.
I went to Washington DC in 1977, and worked in the Carter White House, Office of Science and Technology Policy. Then I worked in the Environmental Protection Agency as a policy analyst and also as the speechwriter for the Administrator. In 1986, I was promoted to the Senior Executive Service of the U.S., the highest level of the federal civil service. That same year, Robert K. Tanenbaum contacted me and asked me to write a courtroom thriller to be published under his name. I did that, and since then I have also written the first fifteen novels in the popular Butch Karp and Marlene series.
In 1988 I left Washington, D.C. and settled in Seattle, where I worked as a speechwriter and environmental expert for the state land commissioner. I have been a full-time freelance writer since 1990, mostly on the Karp novels, but also doing non-fiction magazine pieces on biology. My first novel under my own name, TROPIC OF NIGHT, was published in 2003 (William Morrow) and a second novel, VALLEY OF BONES, as well as a children's book THE WITCH'S BOY (Harper Collins) came out in 2005. The third novel, NIGHT OF THE JAGUAR, was available in early 2006. A fourth thriller for Morrow, THE BOOK OF AIR AND SHADOWS was published in 2007, and was a New York Times bestseller. FORGERY OF VENUS followed, and then I moved to a different publisher and wrote THE GOOD SON and THE RETURN, for them. I am married, with three grown children.

Bears eye rare win over Lions, end of skid against division 4 Months ago
Source: USA Today Tweet
LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears have a rare opportunity to beat the Detroit Lions and pick up a victory over an NFC North opponent.
As accomplishments go, those seem rather modest. Then again, consider their recent history.
The division-leading Bears have a chance to check off two more boxes when they host the struggling Lions on Sunday.
They have lost nine of the past 10 games against Detroit and have dropped 10 in a row to division opponents heading into their matchup at Soldier Field.
Since the start of the 2014 season, Chicago is 4-21 against the NFC North. But these Bears aren't those Bears.
Chicago (5-3) hit the halfway mark with its best record in five years and sole possession of the NFC North lead for the first time since 2013. It's a big change for a franchise with four straight last-place finishes. But the Bears have already matched their win total from last year and are making a push for their first playoff appearance since the 2010 team advanced to the NFC championship game.
"There's just so much ball left," said coach Matt Nagy, in his first season. "For our team, we've won in different ways and we've lost in different ways. I think we've kind of learned different ways to do it. And when you lose, you try to figure out why and how to not let it happen again. When you win, you figure out why and how you can always improve and be better. I like where we're at, but we understand we have a ways to go."
Chicago is coming off back-to-back wins over two struggling teams, with a 41-9 blowout at Buffalo after beating the New York Jets at home.
Detroit (3-5) has dropped two in a row and last week's 24-9 loss at Minnesota was particularly ugly. Matthew Stafford got sacked 10 times, and the Lions were held to single digits in points for the first time since a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016.
They also traded wide receiver Golden Tate to Philadelphia prior to the Vikings game, and they fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano on Monday night.
"Definitely have to learn from some of those things that we've done in the past that haven't been up to par or haven't been good enough, and try to minimize those or eliminate them as we go forward," coach Matt Patricia said. "That's the most important thing."
Here are some things to know about the matchup:
ON THE MEND
The Bears might get star outside linebacker Khalil Mack (ankle) and top receiver Allen Robinson (groin) back from injuries.
Both players missed the past two games. But they went through full practices on Wednesday. Tight end Adam Shaheen might also return from a foot injury he suffered in the preseason.
ANSAH BACK
The Lions got a boost last week with the return of defensive end Ziggy Ansah.
He had a sack in the second quarter that forced the Vikings to settle for a field goal, after missing six games because of a shoulder injury. Having Ansah back means more pressure on the quarterback and maybe better luck stopping the run. The Lions rank 30th in that area.
"We've just got to set an edge and whoever has got a gap to be in, they've just got to be in there," Ansah said. "Just play fundamental and be able to execute."
FAMILIAR FOES
The Bears are about to meet the Lions twice in a 12-day span, with a Thanksgiving matchup at Ford Field and a primetime Sunday game against Minnesota at home in between.
This three-game run facing the NFC North comes after four in row against the AFC East. Chicago hasn't played a division team since a 24-23 season-opening loss at Green Bay, when it blew a 20-point lead against an injured Aaron Rodgers.
STRUGGLING STAFFORD
After a solid stretch, Stafford has struggled a bit the past two weeks with 13 sacks and a 90.3 rating. He had ratings above 100 in each of the previous five games.
"He's been with the Lions for all of his career and he has a great group of receivers, and for some reason they're not putting games together," Bears cornerback Prince Amukamara said. "But they're still a great team and I know for a fact we won't take them lightly."
GETTING OFFENSIVE
While a defense that ranks fifth overall has gotten much of the credit, the Bears insist their offense is doing its part.
Though Trubisky has been wild at times, his rating (96.1) is similar to Stafford's (96.5). Chicago also ranks fifth in the NFL in scoring.

To protect your identity, we recommend that you register your nickname with NickServ. You can get more information on how to do this by typing /msg NickServ Register into the channel.
Do Not Beg for Ops - Ops, or channel operators (indicated by a @, %, ~, or & next to their nickname) are moderators of the room.

While we do recruit non- forum/production staff members to assist us in moderation on occasion, we invite you, and not the other way around.
Do Not Evade Bans - Ban evasion, which is defined as deliberately getting around a ban (either by changing your IP or other means) before the ban is served completely. Ban evasion will result in a temporary ban becoming a permanent one. Repeat attempts will result in it being considered as harassment, the consequences of which are defined below.
Follow Operator Instructions - We ask that you follow all instructions given to you by channel operators. Failure to follow instructions will result in a kick and/or ban from the channel. If you feel you were unfairly targeted by an operator, you may file a report us at Admin@nris.com
Do Not Harass Members - Harassing members or moderators of the chat room, or any other user on the IRC server will result in severe repercussions, including but not limited to a kline -- or permanent ban from the server (not just the channel) -- and possibly a police report, depending on the severity of the harassment.
No Leetspeak - Please do not use "leet speak" (l1k3 7h1s s0r7 0f 7yp1ng) or variants thereof. Also, using excessive forms of slang or "street talk" may result in warnings, and eventually a kick/ban from the channel.
Monday Night Chats - Our weekly Monday night chat sessions (beginning at 7:00pm Pacific, and ending before midnight) may have different rules and regulations associated with them.
Operator Authority - Channel operators are empowered to enforce these regulations, make exceptions to them when necessary, and use their discretion when applying punishment. If you feel you have been treated unfairly, you may file a complaint at Admin@NRIS.com

National Wildlife Federation Action Fund - Help Deliver Half a Million Messages for Polar Bears
Help Deliver Half a Million Messages for Polar Bears
Tuesday, April 17, 2012
By: Jennifer Janssen
Help us meet our goal of hand-delivering 500,000 messages to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by Friday in support of limits on carbon pollution.
The conservation and environmental community set an ambitious goal to together hand-deliver half a million messages to the EPA from people like you--and we are nearing the goal.
In 2012, as polar bears in the southern area of their range struggle from disappearing ice, wildlife advocates like you stepped up by sending over 43,000 messages to the Environmental Protection Agency in support of limits to global warming pollution.
Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency officially released the first ever proposed limits on carbon pollution from new power plants. Coal-fired power plants are our nation's biggest carbon polluters and are currently allowed to emit unlimited amounts of global warming pollution.
Next week, we will deliver the messages to the EPA, but we need a few more people to take action to meet the 500,000 goal by Friday.
Please take action for polar bears and share with your friends today!

Waning of the Chinese Commodity Boom to Continue in 2016
Posted on January 4, 2016 by Sarah J Cohen
The piecemeal waning of China’s ten-year old commodity boom that started last year is expected to continue in 2016 as well. The slowdown of the country’s industrial base and consumption is hurting energy and mining companies, as the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity Index plummeted by 25 percent over the year, hitting its lowest level since 2002 in December. According to the analyst, Mr. Mark To, of the Wing Fung Financial Group, “the chances of an optimistic 2016 are bleak” adding that “slowing economic growth and structural reforms in China might contribute to decreased demand for commodities.” Moreover, further interest rate hikes by the US Fed are expected to further strengthen the dollar and make commodities more costly for international customers.
A variety of commodities have been hit by global oversupply and slowing Chinese demand, such as iron ore, whose price fell by 40 percent in 2015 – the trend that is expected to continue this year as well. The price of coal likewise went down, by one-third last year, as a result of the rise of renewable energy and slower Chinese demand. The stagnation in the commodity sector negatively affected firms such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American, including merchants like Asia’s Noble Group and Europe’s Glencore, making them downsize and sell assets.
When it comes to oil, the development in the sector has essentially copied that of other commodities as prices of benchmark crude and natural gas also plummeted by two-thirds since they started falling in 2014. Morgan Stanley commented that “headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil”, citing increases in the world’s supply and a slowdown in demand. A general consensus among industry analysts is that meaningfully higher prices should not be expected before the end of this year.

HCR ManorCare Honors 2018 Fourth-Quarter National Champion of Caring
Source: News
TOLEDO, Ohio, Jan. 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — HCR ManorCare takes great pride in its helpful, caring and responsive employees who are committed to providing quality care to our patients and residents. Our employees around the country are regularly honored at their locations by patients, residents, family members and fellow employees for the care and caring they provide. Our company has taken the recognition a step higher in launching a program that honors on a quarterly basis an HCR ManorCare Champion of Caring, a national champion across all service lines.
2018 Fourth-Quarter Champion Announced
“I am pleased to announce that our 2018 fourth-quarter HCR ManorCare Champion of Caring is Yvonne Cunningham, resident caregiver/med tech at Arden Courts of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania,” said David Parker, executive vice president and chief operating officer. “Yvonne has never let anything compromise the care of her residents and continually impresses families with her helpful, caring and responsive dedication.” Yvonne has been a celebrated caregiver at Arden Courts of King of Prussia for more than 10 years. Although already credentialed in a variety of areas, she continues to advance her education. She moves easily among roles, and no job is too big or small. Yvonne brings a “wow” factor to the memory care center’s census culture, always highlighting why Arden Courts will be the perfect fit for a potential resident, which has been key to many move-ins. Her engaging personality has helped her house to remain fully occupied most of the time. She leads the center’s shadowing program and is a valued mentor. Yvonne is 100 percent about making the residents’ lives better and proof that one person can make a difference.
Yvonne was chosen from among finalists representing each of HCR ManorCare’s five operating divisions. Each of the finalists had already distinguished her- or himself by being chosen a Divisional Champion of Caring from among thousands of employees. Divisional finalists not chosen as the national champion in the previous three quarters joined five new divisional finalists in the selection pool for the 2018 fourth quarter. The five new finalists for the fourth quarter were:
Stephen Fulse, Medical Records Assistant, ManorCare Health Services – Hinsdale, Illinois
Dwayne George, Lead Floor Tech, ManorCare Rehab Center – Decatur, Georgia
Carla Nelson, Social Worker, Heartland Hospice of Broward, Plantation, Florida
Antonio Rosario, Laundry Attendant, ManorCare Health Services – King of Prussia, Pennsylvania
Deborah Taylor, Resident Caregiver, Arden Courts of Wayne, New Jersey
Each of our finalists had the qualities we were looking for in an HCR ManorCare Champion of Caring. We congratulate Yvonne, our 2018 fourth-quarter HCR ManorCare Champion of Caring, and also her peer finalists. All exhibit the qualities of champion caregivers.
HCR ManorCare is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization which includes a network of 13 hospitals, 2,700 physicians, a health plan, 400 skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers, memory care communities, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, home health and hospice agencies. Driven by its Mission to improve health and well-being, ProMedica has been nationally recognized for its advocacy programs and efforts to address social determinants of health.

Release of MSC CoSim Pushes the Boundaries of CAE Technology
Multiphysics Co-Simulation Software Raises the Bar for Accuracy and Performance
NEWPORT BEACH, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 7, 2019 / MSC Software Corporation, a global technology leader in computer-aided engineering (CAE) simulation software and services, today announced the debut release of the MSC CoSim engine that has been developed in order to provide a co-simulation interface for the direct coupling of different solvers/disciplines within a multiphysics framework. This version, V1.6, enables engineers to set up co-simulation models between Adams (MBD), Marc (FEA) and scFLOW (CFD) and it covers a wide range of industrial scale applications including washing machine drum vibration to fuel tank sloshing for FSI and MBD; moving diaphragm valves to non-standard fans and pumps; dynamic windshield wiper blades to hydraulic actuators; and non-linear rubber door seals to vehicle bushes.
MSC’s Comprehensive CAE Co-Simulation Portfolio
Holistic Multiphysics Co-Simulation
With a strong pedigree stretching back to the early NASA moon landing project, MSC Software has been providing world-class multiphysics CAE solutions with its best-in-class products to engineers globally for well over a decade now. Co-simulation matters to a CAE engineer: it provides a unique, more complete and holistic performance insight by coupling together multiple simulation disciplines. Everything from acoustics to multibody dynamics (MBD), to CFD, to structural analysis and explicit crash dynamics can be connected together in toolchains today.
Multiphysics Co-Simulation Delivers Increased Accuracy, Precision & Performance
Co-simulation helps to avoid inaccurate assumptions and, therefore, leads to a better correlation between CAE simulation and physical testing, so engineers gain a richer insight into the performance of the actual product without over-design. Co-simulation can provide a higher level of simulation accuracy with realistic engineering analysis demands inside real-world engineering design timescales. For example, to simulate a full vehicle hitting a curb with the lower control arm undergoing plastic deformation, it could take engineers weeks to finish one simulation if the entire system is simulated in a nonlinear FEA environment. However, with MBD-FEA co-simulation, engineers can capture the same level of fidelity in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks.
Co-simulation technologies that are already supported by MSC Software enable engineers to solve CAE problems that could never have been solved before. Multibody Dynamics (MBD) codes like Adams are being used extensively for industrial grade co-simulations around the world today as a matter of course, and Adams has open connections to a vast array of commercial and open-source CAE software, such as the market-leading Discrete Element Modeling software, EDEM, from DEM Solutions, VIRES Virtual Test Drive (VTD) for ADAS and autonomous vehicle drive simulation, and MATLAB and SIMULINK (from MathWorks) for 1D systems and controls modeling.
Commenting on MSC’s Co-Simulation capabilities, Dr. Steve Jia, the chief engineer, Litens Automotive Group, notes that the “Adams-Marc co-simulation capability more than satisfies our guideline of ‘reasonable results in a reasonable time.’ With up to a 90 percent reduction in computation time, optimization using advanced nonlinear FEA becomes practical. Such a development provides a great benefit and is crucial for our product development and we are proud to work together with MSC in advancing the technology.”
Paolo Guglielmini, CEO of MSC Software, speaking about the release of the new MSC CoSim Engine, said, “We are super-excited about this product release, which is the culmination of many years of development of co-simulation technologies inside MSC Software. I genuinely believe that this is pushing the boundaries of true multiphysics simulation and it raises the bar for the uptake of CAE co-simulation in the real world to the masses of engineers today who can benefit from it.”

The Day I met Jesus.
Here's a story to warm the cockles of your heart and has that added bonus of being true.
I may have hinted this yarn somewhere before, but since it involves someone who went down in history,
a re-telling shouldn't be too out-of-order.
It was 1968 and I was eight years-old. Living in a small town and having acquired a mentality suitable for such
a slow, out-of-touch environment, the edge of my world ended anywhere over a mile south of where I lived.
Why south? -you may ask. Well, that was because I lived on the northern edge of a town where miles of countryside
waited to be plundered by a kid my age and anything that could be classed as a street or a collection of houses,
all resided in the direction my mother would call the town centre. South.
The macrocosm of a child is bound in a special type of barb-wire, it snags things that adults fail to hold as important.
For myself at that time, knowing where an owl makes it's nest or finding a dead dog are jewels that far outshine the
knowledge we adhere to in the grown-up world.
Bogged down with societal bonds, adults stop smelling the magic and I honestly believe they also lose that connection
between themselves and a reality that lengthens their time here. Still, 1968 was surely going to be the same as last year
in my little kingdom.
But unknown to me and probably my parents too, the world outside mine was up to all sorts of weirdness.
There was a war in a jungle somewhere between the Americans and someone never truly explained. The fella who
killed Kennedy said he wouldn't be seeking re-election and the black-dude who wanted us all to look beyond our facia
differences was shot dead in Memphis.
Making sure the string around the rim of my jam-jar wouldn't snap and checking that my fishing net didn't have holes in it,
the news that the widow of that Kennedy-guy and was marrying some Greek with lots of ships and the Zodiac Killer
was just testing his wings out on Solano County's Herman Road were something beyond my appreciation and certainly
my interest.
Noisy incidents in another room.
John and Ian were waiting for me at the bottom of my little street. It wasn't called a street, it was called 'Gardens' because...
well, all the terraced-houses had gardens, I suppose. Life doesn't have to be complicated, you know?
These two boys were four years older than me and if you can think back to your own youth, that meant a lot.
Older boys knew about sex, older boys knew lots of good stuff like that and if you're quiet and listen, sometimes you can
learn a thing-or-two. Wisdom is currency in the world of a child, it purchases standing and it strengthens character.
Where adults talk in a language of the gordian, the kids with the scuffed knees and bubblegum-smelling breath articulate
their opinions with tones of simple dread and the accumen of warning.
It's all about preparing yourself to die and become one of those adults.
As I walked behind the two boys, I listened for the enlightenment. Where we were going to capture red-bellied newts
could wait, there was 'stuff-mining' to be done and in their chatter, I could already hear the sounds that told me that
such a type of gold was nearing the surface.
Stuff like, the contents of golf balls is poisonous and made from crazy-men's semen, whatever that is. What time was
best to clamber over the wall of the alley behind my house and keeping low and quiet, watch through the frosted-glass
of a downstairs bathroom window for one the two young women showering in the house strangely labeled 'for Students'
Keeping up with John and Ian's brisk pace, I discovered that students are older girls who can think. They can make you
look silly with their brains, but their bodies are fantastic. Scaling that wall at my current height was still beyond me and
the desire to observe women with pubic hair was even more distant. Still, the ammunition of data can be carried and
used later.
We were heading down the main road that in 1968, could never imagine the amount of traffic that uses it now. The
wisdom being dispatched slowed and accepting that if you look up at the sky when you run, you travel faster, I trotted
behind the pair as they crossed the highway that had never known a traffic jam.
As we passed the school that they used to to attend and the one I still did, John and Ian turned their focus on what lay
ahead. It wasn't whether the recent rains had over-flooded the place we were going to and it wasn't the concern that
we might be trespassing on private property at some point. Even the suggestion that the creatures we sought didn't
actually inhabit the many pools that paralleled the ash and cinder path we were travelling to, wasn't the main concern.
It was that we were entering a different land, a realm peopled with kids who may take umbrage at our invasion and
require a payment of kind. Namely a fight. As my cheap sand-shoes slapped along the pavement and my jam-jar
knocked against my bare-thigh, I wondered if this expedition wasn't the exciting and sunny adventure I'd imagined,
but a trek to altercation with strangers holding high dudgeon and the need to deliver a bloody nose.
But you can't turn back and run. You can't show your cowardliness in the shadow of older kids. You just can't.
Changing the position of my fishing net like a soldier re-shouldering his rifle, I kept in the march towards an unknown
enemy that would undoubtedly make me cry and certainly bleed.
It's called -because it's still there, 'The Black Path' and it links a road that once assisted a steel-rolling company that
created shaped metal for the country's needs to a newer breed of manufacturers. Something with the then-swanky
title of an 'Industrial Estate'.
In truth, this set of one-floor buildings comprised of two businesses, a tyre-outlet and a set of offices that typed
something. It was there and the Town Council had funded it, so I suppose it merited calling it something fashionable.
But The Rolling Mills was quite different and held a history of patriotism and the working-class sense of hard-work-maketh
-the-man. Sprawling for as far as a child's mind could comprehend, the smoke-pluming and noisy factory once produced
metal window frames until the Second World War shouted that it needed assistance.
Nissan huts, armour-piercing shells, tanks and Bailey bridges were all manufactured there behind the walls higher than
any kid could scale -naked student or not, but by 1968, their main requirement was construction steel for a world that
knew what 'good steel' really meant.
The Rolling Mills was an immoveable object when I was growing up and nothing but-nothing would ever make it go away.
In later years, I would visit the public house that served the men who toiled in the taming of the molten snakes that were
disgorged from their shaping rollers. It was on the corner of the Black Path and belonged to a time of we've gladly relinquished.
The front Bar was always hot with a raging coal fire and the rear 'Games Room' was freezing, open to the elements due
to the door being useless after a customer was smashed through it.
Saturday nights were for swollen faces and bruise-closed eyes. No pool cue was ever broken over the head of a reprobate
and no pool-ball was ever thrown at a fleeing client. Such equipment was stolen years before. Cigarette smoke was in the
air alongside 'High-Karate' aftershave that was given at Christmas.
During the week, the tavern would see dirt-smudged faces staring into horse-racing results in tabloids, whilst gulping
down their ale to quench their thirsts. A line of thick wooden-soled shoes that protected the Mill's employees feet could
be seen at the pub's front door.
These scuffed and studded Frankenstein boots were to guard from the screaming metal that quietened it's wrath
between the tongs and the legs of those who drank their breaks away. 'On the tongs' was a task where the money was
made and yet, extremely dangerous.
I have a friend who's father sported a galleon tattooed on his chest from his navy days and took on the tongs back in
the seventies. One winter's evening, a stretch of metal came bolting out of the rollers and for some unknown reason,
decided to 'scream'
This is a rare action, it's when the semi-soft metal bar twists and jumps from it's controlled route to the next set of
elongating metal drums. This particular beam screamed and hunted down my friend's fleeing father and out-doing the
metal's cry, he also screamed as it left it's mark and turned the inked-galleon into a ugly birthmark of remembrance.
That clanging place forged men and metal, and to a child, was an eternal palace of the Gods. It closed in the nineteen
eighties.
Our quest for the miniature dragons took us into a municipal park that I recognised when my older-sister used to take
me out in a push-chair. I'd never realised it was so far away from my home and even though there was some comfort
to be gained by this revelation, I kept it to myself. I might have been only eight, but I knew one did not mention being
even younger when among those who were lighting your way towards the teenage years.
Pretending the surrounding location meant nothing to me, I dared to walk faster and get alongside John and Ian.
I recall it was summer because of the foliage and there wasn't any snow. The rain I mentioned should also be a good
indicator because no English summer is a real summer without it pissing down somewhere between May and August.
Giant elms surrounded the play-area and along with creaking oaks, shrouded another part of the council-ran property
that wouldn't -or shouldn't be interesting by children wanting to find dizziness on the cast-iron roundabout or enjoy
gathering dog-shit on the back of their clothes by sliding down the towering chute. That 'other' place was a cemetery.
All the play equipment was made by Wicksteed Kettering by the way, a name that will never leave me.
The beginning of the Black Path took us under a railway bridge that serviced the North and South sections of the Mill.
John imparted that bats lived under this shadowed construction and it had been said that they sometimes swoop down
and bite.
Needless to say, my wide eyes scanned the rivet-welded reinforcements for the twinkling of licked fangs and leathery
cloaks in our passing.
The daylight on the other side displayed a field to my left, holding a pond in it's centre that John assured both Ian and
myself, never dried up even in the hottest of summers. It was a said a giant pike patrolled the depths and would watch
from the murk for solitary children gambolling on it's banks. John said so.
To my right, a high metal fence contained a tangle of bramble bushes and the barrier continued to a place I never heard
of until then. It was a Gypsy Camp, a settlement of people that kept themselves to themselves. Ian commented that the
community were known as thieves and rarely bathed. Thinking of the terrible fish in the pond, my young mind could
appreciate why. We followed the path to the left.
The pot-holed tarmac gave way to the ash and cinder, the waste material of the Rolling Mills. It was officially a path now
and the trees and bushes that bordered the route didn't seem to suffer from the dumped clinkers. Every step made a
loud crunching sound and I wondered to myself if the supposed feral-families in the camp behind us would give us a
second thought.
Adjusting my snake-belt and hitching my short pants up, I was changing from a bewildered kid in a foreign land into a
hunter of fiery-bellied amphibians and an explorer with my companions. My older companions.
I say that because I had friends of my own age, but such solidarity is only maintained when parents don't intervene with
the use of holidays. Summer is when the English-made company called 'Butlins' is utilised and families would spend a week
at a holiday-camp with a social structure that held communal spirit as a prerequisite.
Without the need for violins, my family couldn't afford such vacations and so, I was with older boys wandering under
some bushes.
We made our way through the dark tunnel of leaves for around ten minutes without speaking. Occasionally, a large pool
would appear at the edges of path and stunted willows sat in the flooded waters. The hawthorn bushes on our right
stopped and brand-spanking new wooden fence hid whatever there was to be hidden. It could have been ten feet-tall,
but I was eight years-old and proportions were not paramount at that age. Big and little were usually the measurements.
The trees and bushes stopped and before us was lay the narrow path cutting through several pools of dirty water.
John announced that this was where the newts lived and I licked my lips in excitement. I hadn't been beaten up and
the vampire bats had not taken my blood.
Engraving Egyptian gravel-gliphs on my knee as I crouched down to fill my jam-jar with water, I felt the thrill of anticipation
that I'm sure anglers feel as they set up their gear.
I could suggest other light-hearted and positive thoughts a young person may deliberate during the trials of their age, but this
isn't a story read out to a afternoon-drowsy class of school children. When you're the youngest in the group, you wait for the
mood shift of the senior, the sea-change of the elder when what you rightfully own can be taken by force.
True childhood happiness is built on a base of suspicion that the world isn't what your parents told you, even if
you want it to be. It's real and I reckon it's part of being prospective prey. Anyway, my jar was filled.
If such beasties existed in the smelly standing water, they'd found a grand hiding place. The aroma of the over-
rated puddles contended with the oily stink of recently-applied creosote of the fence and my goodwill began to wane in the
bouquet of malodor.
My salamander-empty jar dangled from the remains of a nail on a post as I scooped and frowned, frowned and scooped.
The bamboo cane bent at times, but I knew it was only an indication that either the fishing net had caught the
edge of a discarded car tyre or a willow root finding it's blackened drink. Melville's Ahab, I was not.
Curses were muttered, eyes met in doubt and the sun shone down on all of us.
When the suggestion came from John that the newts may be using pools hidden on the other side of the fence,
Ian and and I agreed it was worth taking a look at. Like Musketeers, we examined the height of the fence and it's
pointed top. Each unplaned board had been cut to hold a sharp apex and if I was to garnish the situation with
hyperbole, I could say the clouds touched the tips.
John went first with a fair run-up. Grabbing the diagonal edge of a board, he began to make his feet imagine
they were still running and scrambled his body upwards. Pushing with his arms, a leg cleared the 'V' and
without sitting on the top, he dropped into the unknown on the other side.
John's shaven-head appeared after a moment and asked for the containers and the nets to be handed over.
Emptying my jar of only thing I'd captured this day, the taller Ian serviced the request.
Up he went and after dangling against the warm wood for a second on two, began his ascent to the jagged top.
Ian's baseball boots scraped for purchase and with sinews contracting, he too slipped over the fence.
Although, I secretly believed a rib was grazed by one of those spikes in his journey.
I didn't make it. I could say my attempt was thwarted by the cut I acquired when I grabbed one of the spikes,
but the reality was that I was too small and too weak. My rubber soles burned in their haste to propel me into
the realms of my peers, but my spirit didn't hold the same verve.
Looking forlorn and looking up at the mocking barrier, I awaited the verdict from those who were winners.
John's head loomed over between the wooden skewers and said if they would take a look around and if the
newts were found, he'd drop a couple in my jar. I nodded and showed his my greased-stained wound.
The palm wasn't really bleeding, but any injury can be used to explain a failing.
John's eyes told me that it was my problem and without a word, disappeared from view.
There was no internet, no mobile phone to pass one's time away with on a slow-moving summer's day.
But before that ever-changing invention came along, kids still had the ability to get through a waiting period.
For me, I inspected the terrible damage to my hand and wondered if there was an older kid's anecdote that
said creosote was a deadly poison.
That was when the priest came by.
A man of around the late-twenties, but to an eight year-old, he was just an adult. Sporting the usual all-black
garb with the white dog-collar, he carried a slight smile that increased as he saw me sitting beside the post
that had once held my newt-container. Sans newt.
He was dark-haired and I'd guess women would say he wasn't ugly, but I cannot vouch for what students
would think, of course.
There are words to inflate the actual reason for this story and considering what he said -and if I was a religious person,
I could nail some colloquy to the mast of taking theological credenda serious to enhance society's values.
But my jar was empty and my hand hurt.
"Hello" the priest said as he passed me. I was sitting like one of them old Cherokee Chiefs that John Wayne looks down at
in the Saturday morning matinees I'd been to. The smile never faded as all I offered back were distrustful eyes.
Priests and Vicars belonged in the world of 'do this or you go to Hell' and for a child, the rules of family and schooling were
more than enough to contend with without worrying about laws that concern the afterlife.
I hadn't got the hang of this one yet.
Not being married didn't help. I was still too young to appreciate innuendo of religious celibacy, but when a teenager implies
a weirdness through a clerical axiom to a boy of my age, it's a baton of wisdom that you keep close and use like a crucifix to
ward off the unknown aspersion.
The priest was at my 10 o'clock now and slowly falling away from my interest.
As the sun made my greasy injury look slick, I thought about John and Ian chuckling in merriment among
splashing basilisks escaping swooping nets. Seeing mangled flesh (come on man, really?!) and yet imagining wriggling newts.
My absorption dwelled in the possibilities that they would judge a small amount of their catch and my input to
the situation. Would the older boys decide that four newts were two newts each...? Maybe even three of six
divided equally?
"Do you know who I am...?" the priest said watching me from where the Black Path turned the last of it's length towards a
side entrance to the fabled Industrial Estate. His convivial features had gone and for a second, I wondered what might happen
if I tell him I didn't hear his question.
Quickly checking the spool of my cerebral tape-recorder, I acknowledged the query with a stare, I mean, what do you say to a
guy who wears his shirt-collar backwards?
Maybe I could advised him to seek out the Pope and ask him if he knew the confused cinder-path walker's identity or even
check for a name on the back of his underwear. Can God help...? Is there a prayer that doubles as a finger in the phone-book?
Only soapy-naked students would know for sure.
But I didn't. I felt I was being trapped somehow and this question was some-sort of controlling ruse.
I wouldn't have been able to word it like that then, but the feeling was tangible and that's all prey needs to ready it's escape.
To the pond behind me...? I could skirt the edge and avoid the snapping maw of he beneath the surface and maybe the pike
would treat the chasing priest to Jonah's mode of travel?
Vaulting the fence was out, wound-or-no wound, my little legs would fail me and the priest could grab me from behind and
dispatch the wailing kid in delphic ways I was too young to think about. The Gyspy Camp may save me from this questioning
and staring man of the cloth. But would it mean a life of the Artful Dodger...? All light-fingered and eyes of the bandit.
The seconds that I'd like to call 'months' that wavered in the air between us held no noise except for a faint clang of a metal
serpent being tamed in the rolling mills behind me. I assumed the priest was waiting for an answer. The faint memory of
overhearing a conversation about some cabalistic act of buggery within the Church swam past like a mocking Pleurodelinae
but it was beyond my years and all I knew was it involved choirboys.
Then the priest told me the answer that had presumably alluded him and assumedly -myself. However, the information didn't
resolve my rising panic.
"I'm Jesus, that's who I am..." he said with a tone of haughtiness and for reasons only he knew, repeated that last part.
"...That's who I am" With that, he went on his way.
Watching the retreating messenger of God, I wondered what just happened and whether the danger was over.
I would be fifteen before I thought that I'd should've checked his hands for holes and asked him to fix my own.
A Catholic friend that will always be close to my heart and could fight like a demon, once imparted to me during those growing
years that a Jehovah's witness was a person who believed the man who witnessed Jesus being burned at the stake.
His name was jehovah.
The priest didn't look charred.
The end of the story is that there were no newts on the other side of the fence. John, Ian and myself tramped home without
any incident to mention and I never told them of the strange encounter.
Paul met Jesus on the road to Damascus, I got the cinder track to an Industrial Estate.
And God knows what happened to my fishing net.

Likewise Swiss chard that has celebrated five birthdays and boasts a girth of six inches looks normal at Mark Phillips’ Absalona Greenhouse Farm in Chepachet, Rhode Island. Twenty years now in the business of hydroponic farming, Phillips has mastered the art of soil-free growing. Of his accumulated knowledge what he didn’t learn from his plants themselves he mostly learned from listening to his gut rather than to opinions of others.
“I fell into it. I didn’t think I was going to work for myself,” said Phillips who earned an environmental studies degree in college. Unbeknownst to him his career was set in motion the day he took a job at a greenhouse the summer after graduating. But he took to the work and in 1990 decided to go into business for himself.
“I figured I’m good at it, I could work for myself and bring my dog,” he began. “But I didn’t know it was going to be like this,” he added telling of how the success he eventually achieved wreaked havoc on his life.
“In 2003 I was doing everything right but it wasn’t working.”
The reason in large part was NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement). Its passage Phillips explained meant that Canadian growers with access to cheap energy could easily undercut him. To satisfy the demands of his clients, Bread & Circus (now Whole Foods) and Super Stop & Shop, he pushed the limits of three greenhouses to produce 3,000 heads of lettuce a week.
“I was getting up in the middle of the night to pick heads by hand,” Phillips recalled.
“It was a lot of stress. I had to stay within the ballpark of what (Canadian growers) were doing.” Despite its high productivity – or because of it- Phillips’ farming enterprise that produced a monocrop of the highest quality Boston lettuce was unsustainable.
Rather than hit the wall Phillips put a heavy foot on the brakes. Quitting he realized wasn’t an option since all of his money was tied up in the greenhouses and the unique hydroponic system he had built and finessed to peak performance. So he resisted hauling it all away on an eighteen-wheeler and opted to take a radically different tack. He downsized and diversified. Phillips cut down from three greenhouses to one and said goodbye to lettuce- at least as a cash cow.
Fortunately it was 2003, a time when increasingly the issue of food security was showing up in headlines and people were giving more thought to where their food comes from. In 2004 with the establishment of Farm Fresh Rhode Island, a non-profit with a mission to connect local farmers with consumers to improve public health and the health of the environment, Phillips got onboard. He hauled his harvest to a farmers market.

More comfortable wearing a Patriots hat and boots than say a bandana and Birkenstocks, Phillips at first felt like a fish out of water. But once he caught his stride and customers discovered his lush basil, arugala and other greens, he never looked back. Forever a perfectionist he maintained his insistence on delivering top-notch quality while adapting to his newfound culture. In selling at Coastal Growers Farmers Market in Saunderstown, Rhode Island on Saturdays from May through October, as well as at Aquidneck farmers market up the road in Newport, another in Pawtucket, Phillips displays one or two non-edible items of merchandise under his tent.
“I have shirts,” he said laughing as if still astonished at the thought.
“They have a Grateful Dead skeleton farmer on the front and on the back they’re printed with the words ‘Who’s Your Farmer?’”
In adapting to his new business model Phillips swung 180 degrees from what he had been doing. Whereas a glance inside of his greenhouses once revealed two shades of green – the true green of Boston Lettuce and the dark, slightly blue green of Italian basil – these days Phillips’ greenhouse holds a rich array of colors. Red however is lacking, as Phillips rates tomatoes as not worth the trouble. He views spinach and anything of the cabbage family similarly as not worth the effort. As a whole the cabbage family is “a bug magnet” and spinach is simply “a pain in the butt”, as for okra “it didn’t work,” he said. The greens and herbs growing in his greenhouse are those of gourmet persuasion like mizuna, watercress, tatsoi, peppercress, cilantro, chervil, lemon balm, arugula, fennel, sorrel, bok choy, swiss chard, and kale.

“Some people bring me seeds from their gardens,” said Phillips who asserts that he’s willing to try anything different. By being responsive and thoroughly committed Phillips has garnered a following of 200 or so loyal customers. They seek him out even as his prices exceed those of other growers. After building and rebuilding his greenhouses, installing a heating system, rebuilding an oil heater, and learning electrical wiring because he had to – all with some coaching and eager assistance from his father – Phillips is unabashedly proud of his product and unapologetic about his pricing. Regardless his goods have no trouble selling.
When the talk turns to money Phillips is unflinching.
“I don’t make a lot of money,” he readily volunteered. But he is at the top of his game and has been for some time. Of hydroponics he says, “Anybody can do it”.
“There used to be six hydroponic growers (in Rhode Island). But they got hammered by Canada. People try and then they stop.”
“I learned everything the hard way. I was living cheap,” he said of his success. Now, he explained, people copy his system. In fact his unique system arrived at after much trial and error and tweaking draws a great deal of attention from various entities including the University of Rhode Island.
The intensity of interest eventually got to Phillips who finally put an end to it. But while it could be said that he is not forthcoming with the finer details of his customized hydroponic system, he is not ungenerous with his know-how. One way he shares is by teaching a class in Jamestown, Rhode Island funded by a grant from NASA for the purpose of promoting careers in science.
Asked about the benefits of hydroponic growing versus conventional soil-based farming and about the benefits of hydroponics with regard to sustainability Phillips offers several points. One is that insects are more manageable with hydroponic growing.
“I make sure I don’t get ‘em,” he said putting it simply.
“Pick what you can and move on,” he added elaborating on how he handles bugs on his cucumbers.
“(And) I power wash. People freak-out, Kale (for instance), I just wash ‘em down.”
Similarly chemicals are less of an issue with hydroponic growing Phillips explained. Because of the physical way in which he manages insects Phillips is able to avoid the use of chemical pesticides altogether. And by design a hydroponic growing system functions sustainably.
“Everything is recycled, there’s no storage. (Hydroponics) use less water than conventional, it’s all recycled. All my fertilizer is recycled. It’s a closed system,” explained Phillips.
And of course hydroponic greenhouse systems offer the tremendous benefit of extending the growing season. In Absalona’s early years Phillips typically shut down the operation in December and restarted in March. No longer, now Phillips keeps his operation going all year round.
I have five-year-old swiss chard. They’re already bonsai. I have arugula that I have cut 20 times. That’s how I afford to grow,” said Phillips explaining that in the coldest months of December through February the plants go dormant. Come spring however they are all set to take off in the lengthening daylight.
Just as NAFTA-aided competition once threatened Absalona Greenhouse Farm so success and a stellar reputation now pose a potential threat to its future. Interest in urban agriculture is taking off and as interest builds so too does demand for Phillips’ expertise. Someone wants to install a vertical garden on the face of a skyscraper in Seattle and wants Phillips to head up the project.
“Show me the money,” is Phillips’ response. “You’d have to pay me a lot of money.” After investing $30,000 in Absalona’s first greenhouse, $40,000 in a second that took two years to build, and other immeasurable costs, Phillips is unable or unwilling to put a value on his farm or what it would cost to get him to leave it behind.

Should Your Child Join the Swim Team?
By wpadmin | February 16, 2019	
0 Comment
Swimming is a great sport for kids because it requires a lot of endurance and technique and it uses almost every muscle in the body. If your child expresses an interest in swimming and learning a new sport, the local swim team is a great way to help them perfect their skills and learn the importance of teamwork. But some parents might be hesitant to let their child join the swim team. After all, drowning is a major cause of accidental death in the U.S., especially for children.
However, these incidents remain rare, and having your child join the swim team can help them stay safe in the water if they are under the supervision of a licensed instructor. Read on to learn more about whether you should let your child join the swim team and the benefits of being a proud swim team parent.
Safety Considerations
Some parents might be worried about leaving their child with a swim instructor or having them be in the water all day. While drownings tend to be rare, parents will want to know that they are leaving their child with someone responsible and qualified when it comes to water safety.
That’s why you might want to research the class, team or organization before enrolling your child. You will need to make sure that the swim instructor is licensed and certified. They should also know CPR in the event someone needs resuscitation.
Benefits of Having Your Child Join the Swim Team
Joining a swim team can be a major time commitment for your child. But all this extra work won’t be for nothing. Your child will get a lot out of being on the swim team, including:
Friendship and Community
Your child is bound to make some new friends when they join the swim team. If your child shows an interest in swimming, they will meet other like-minded kids that share their interests. This can lead to fulfilling, lasting friendships that your child will come to cherish. In fact, 65 percent of kids say that they signed up for a team sport to spend more time with their friends.
Self-Esteem and Confidence
Learning a new sport and improving a skill set can lead to better self-esteem and more confidence for your child, both in and out of the pool. Your child will know that they are capable of learning new things, which might encourage them to try new activities in the future.
Water Safety
Your child will also learn about water safety and survival. If you find a swim team with a licensed swim instructor, they can teach your child what to do in certain situations, such as how to deal with a muscle cramp when swimming and what to do when caught in a rip tide. If you have a backyard pool on your property, you can rest assured that your child will know how to use the pool responsibly.
Fitness and Endurance
Of course, signing your kid up for the swim texam also means they will be healthier and more physically fit. Regular and quality physical education can help children and adolescents achieve the recommended amount of daily physical activity and improve their body mass index (BMI). Even a round above-ground pool on your property will help support your child’s efforts to meet their daily swimming requirements.
Potential Downsides of Having Your Child Join the Swim Team
There aren’t many downsides that go along with having your child join the local swim team, except that you’ll need to make some room in their schedule for classes and competitions, either after school, in the morning or on weekends. Here are some of the potential downsides of having your child join the swim team:
Less Time with the Family
You might not see your child as often as you’d like if you allow them to join a swim team. Depending on the nature of the team, their schedule might be filled with practices and competitions. When your child gets home, they might be too tired to spend any quality time with the family.
Transportation
You will also need to figure out a way to get your child to and from swim practice. You or your spouse might have to take turns driving them around. Or you can have them carpool with another team member — though you’ll most likely have to take your turn as a chauffeur, as well.
Less Time for Studying
Your child might also have less time for studying. However, many kids that participate in school sports have plenty of time for their studies. Your child will need to learn how to balance sports and school if they join the local swim team.
Finding the Right Team or Organization for Your Child
If you want to make sure that your child is happy being on the swim team, you should sit down and talk to your child about what they want to get out of this sport. Are they looking to simply make friends, or do they want to become the best possible swimmer they can be? Once you have an idea of what your child is looking for, you can help them find a swim team or program that suits their needs.
Some programs are more about having fun in the summer and learning some basic swim techniques. This will be a good choice if your child is looking to make friends and have some fun in the water when they’re not in school.
Other swim teams and programs are more focused on teaching kids how to compete professionally as divers and swimmers. This involves a lot of practice and training. Your child will learn to hone their skills as they prepare themselves for swim competitions and meetups.
Overall, having your child join the local swim team can have a positive effect on their life. They will be more confident, have more friends and get in great shape. This can even lead to scholarship opportunities down the line if your child is willing to stick with it. Swimming is a great activity for kids above the age of 4. Find a swim team in your community and enroll your child today.

Bullion Vault, Where You Know Where Your Gold Is
Written by Gary North on June 6, 2015
I have recommended Bullion Vault for years. My mother has her trust assets there.
It was always easier to use Bullion Vault than GoldMoney.
Now Bitgold has bought GoldMoney, which was losing money.
Here is a report from the CEO of Bullion Vault.
* * * * * * * * * * * * *On a personal level I am pleased for James Turk, GoldMoney’s founder and guiding hand, who was already in retirement, and with whom I have enjoyed many events and lunches. But the deal has a number of aspects which absolutely demand comment.
The company I run, BullionVault, publishes its audited results every year. GoldMoney never did, and it shows us once again why transparency is profoundly healthy.
At 00.41am on a Saturday morning UK time (after Toronto trading closed on Friday evening) GoldMoney’s recent trading history was quietly published by BitGold. It had to tell the stock-market what it had acquired. Those results made scary reading.
GoldMoney’s sales have collapsed – by 78.7% over three years.
It lost £9.4 million in just one year – 2014.
Its net assets fell from £25.4m in 2013 to £13.1m in 2015.
At its March 2015 year-end it is still posting losses.
The first thing we should understand is how GoldMoney lost so much money in 2014. The answer is presumably a combination of things but mainly that they bet their balance sheet on gold. Or, in the special language of company announcements:
“Profit (Loss) for the financial year includes certain gains and losses on unhedged metal inventories which is not a recurring business for BitGold.”

California considers bill that would outlaw traditional views on sexuality
TNR / April 29, 2018	
By Monica Burke | The Daily Signal
A new bill in California claims to protect LGBT people, but actually limits their choices, censors speech, and infringes upon religious freedom.
AB 2943 would amend the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act — a consumer law that outlaws unfair and deceptive practices — by adding so-called “sexual orientation change efforts” to a list of banned practices. It would in effect ban all practices that the state deems attempting to change one’s sexual orientation — including practices as indirect as the publishing of certain material.
The bill defines sexual change efforts as “any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.”
This expansive law would impose widespread censorship that could implicate authors, speakers, counselors, colleges and universities, and even religious leaders seeking to address unwanted same-sex attraction or gender identity confusion.
The bill defines sexual change efforts as “any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.”
This broad terminology that includes not only attractions, but actions, has drastic implications. The proposed bill could infringe upon the constitutionally protected speech of countless people.
If the bill becomes law, it could punish the speech of religious leaders who preach chastity and, according to the teachings of their religion, maintain that sexual activity should be limited to marriage between one man and one woman.
It could also punish religiously-affiliated counseling services who counsel patients who do not wish to act upon their same-sex attraction for legitimate personal reasons — for example, someone who wants to live by the teachings of their religion on sexuality or to remain faithful to their spouse and children.
It could punish speakers like Ryan T. Anderson of The Heritage Foundation when speaking in California to advocate a traditional view of marriage and human sexuality.
It could punish bookstores, including online platforms like Amazon, that sell recently published books that challenge gender identity ideology, like Anderson’s latest, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment.”
It could also punish religious colleges and universities that maintain codes of conduct requiring students to live consistent with biblical views about sexuality.
This law would be triggered when a transaction occurs—a counselor’s payment, an attendance fee, the cost of a book, or a pastor’s speaking fee. Anyone who is offended by a statement, teaching, or practice with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity could then file a lawsuit against a minister, counselor, author, store, or educational institution that offended them.
A lawsuit could devastate any of these persons or institutions.
First, the accused would be at the mercy of a judge to determine whether or not AB 2943 applies in their case. The California Consumer Legal Remedies Act commands that it be “liberally construed and applied.” By this standard, individuals and institutions would be vulnerable to crippling fines simply for speaking to millennia-old views on human sexuality.
Even if a judge were to spare accused persons from frivolous claims, AB 2943 would still have a chilling effect, as individuals and institutions begin to censor their own speech in order to avoid undergoing multiple costly lawsuits.
This places a burden on the free exercise of religion, too. If individuals or organizations cannot preach the faith-based response to same-sex attraction and gender identity, they cannot freely practice their religion.
Ultimately, AB 2943 treats faith-driven activity to counsel chastity as fraudulent and deceptive, directly violating Justice Anthony Kennedy’s admonition in Obergefell that “religious organizations and persons [be] given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.”
Such an assault on free exercise hurts everyone. Civil liberties travel together, and when we set a precedent for the government to silence certain viewpoints in one context, we should fully expect to see censorship arise in other areas.
The broad nature of AB 2943 also fails to consider those LGBT individuals who may seek help in their efforts to refrain from acting on certain inclinations. These individuals would be denied professional and personal help under AB 2943.
The policy would also affect transgender persons who later cease identifying with the opposite sex and wish to transition back to their biological gender. Under AB 2943, such individuals would be categorically denied the help and support they desire.
AB 2943 poses an imminent threat to civil liberties in California. It does little to protect LGBT persons and only limits the number of perspectives (and assistance) they have access to, while setting a dangerous, Orwellian precedent for government-mandated censorship.
Policymakers must act quickly before the bill can be signed into law.

Basics of Retirement Case Studies
Case study 1: Making the transition to retirement
Judy is 55 years old and is currently working full time with no plans to change her employment arrangements. She wants to retire at 65. She has an annual salary of $70,000 and $400,000 in super. Assuming her 9% employer super contributions continue until she reaches 65, she’ll have around $641,892 in super by the time she retires, which will give her a minimum income of $32,090 pa in retirement.
After speaking to her financial adviser, Judy decides to implement a strategy that could significantly boost her retirement savings while having little impact on her day-to-day budget. She uses her $400,000 super balance to start a pre-retirement pension, drawing down the minimum payment allowed which, in her case, is $16,000 a year. This gives Judy more income than she needs, so she arranges with her employer to make additional contributions to her super from her pre-tax salary under a salary sacrifice arrangement. Her adviser works out exactly how much she needs to contribute to super through salary sacrifice so that her after-tax income is unchanged.
Even though Judy is still receiving the same amount of after-tax income as before, by implementing this transition to retirement strategy, she is able to increase her super balance rather than reducing it, helping her build valuable additional retirement savings.
By using this strategy, Judy could end up with almost $66,000 extra in her super fund by the time she turns 65. These extra funds could increase her minimum retirement income to around $35,380 pa.
Notes
This case study assumes: 7% pa earning rate; 2007–08 tax rates; minimum pension 5% of super balance at age 65.
Case study 2: Generating an income in retirement
Peter retires at age 60. He has $350,000 in super and decides he can live on an income of $27,500 pa during his retirement. Peter compares whether it would be more effective to draw this income using an allocated pension or through a non-super investment.
Using a non-super investment
Because Peter is 60 years old, he does not have to pay any tax when he withdraws his super, so his initial investment amount is still $350,000. However, Peter’s investment earnings and his regular income withdrawals would be taxed at his marginal tax rate. Peter would need to withdraw $32,262 pa to receive an after-tax income of $27,500 pa, meaning he would pay $4,762 pa in income tax (including the Medicare levy).
Using an allocated pension
As Peter is 60 years old, he can invest his total super balance of $350,000 in an allocated pension without having to pay any tax on its withdrawal from his super fund. In addition, due to his age, Peter would receive all pension payments tax-free. This means that to receive an after-tax income of $27,500 pa, he needs only to withdraw a pension payment of $27,500 pa. The net result is that Peter’s money will last longer if he uses an allocated pension, as shown in the graph below.

Optometry's Meeting® attendees ask questions at Colleague to Colleague, an open forum with the AOA Board of Trustees.
Optometry's Meeting® day three was all about networking, learning and joining a revolutionary new tool for optometric care.
"When something is right for patient care and for the profession, we stand together and work together to support the cause, and this is one of those causes."
From the Optometric Educators Exchange and alumni receptions in the evening, to the first full day touring the Exhibit Hall and logging valuable continuing education (CE) hours, attendees had a wealth of offerings to experience. And below are several highlights from the day that your colleagues are sure to be talking about:
The future is now—AOA MORE
AOA's milestone clinical registry launched with a stirring response as Optometry's Meeting attendees became the first to explore and sign up for the new benefit.
AOA MORE (Measures and Outcomes Registry for Eyecare) by Prometheus Research took the spotlight in Thursday's AOA House of Delegates session as the Quality Improvement and Registries Committee introduced the game-changing database to state affiliates with a lively launch presentation.
The secure, private database systematically aggregates anonymous patient data from multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems and facilitates secondary uses of the data to help enhance outcomes, procedures and standards of practice.
Jeff Michaels, O.D., Quality Improvement and Registries Committee chair, said during the launch: "Today optometry reaches another historic milestone, not unlike achieving diagnostics, therapeutics and therapies such as lasers and surgical scope expansion. When something is right for patient care and for the profession, we stand together and work together to support the cause, and this is one of those causes."
The eagerness spilled over into AOA Central where conference attendees visited the AOA MORE booth to receive tutorials, view screenshots and complete registry sign-ups.
AOA MORE launches with three participating EHR systems, and three additional systems recently committed and will be included shortly in upcoming program releases. The registry is an AOA-member benefit to those who are current with their dues, and will be available to non-AOA members for a $1,800 per year fee.
Click here to visit the new AOA MORE webpage for more information.
Open discussion with AOA board
AOA MORE was also a popular topic of conversation during the second-ever Colleague to Colleague forum with the AOA Board of Trustees. Open to all attendees for continuing education CE credit this year, the board fielded questions ranging from advocacy and legislation, to the profession's future and more.
Each trustee reviewed current AOA and optometric issues, including:
The U.S. Supreme Court's dismissal yesterday of the legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act;
New accreditation standards for schools and colleges of optometry;
Contact lens Universal Pricing Policies (UPP);
Think About Your Eyes advertising campaign;
The transition of students from American Optometric Student Association (AOSA) members to AOA members; and,
Emerging technologies and telemedicine.
In regard to transitioning students from AOSA to AOA membership, Barbara L. Horn, O.D., board trustee, discussed a new project team that is investigating ways to make the move more seamless. It was noted that students attending the AOA's annual Congressional Advocacy Conference have a higher rate of membership transition, and because of that a new student summit will take place at Optometry's Meeting 2017 in Washington, D.C., to connect students with optometry's advocates.
"We're looking forward to getting students there, and showing them what membership and advocacy is about for our profession," Dr. Horn said.

Wangchen Jackie Chan, Wang Cheng-feng, this is the greatest expectations of each parent of the child, and each family's education is also different to treat their children. Some go with the flow, let the child free play; some are eager child eager, demanding of their children.
Xiao Ming and Wang are at the same table, their parents treat their studies have different practices. Xiao-Ming achievements are excellent, parents want him to have a good future, so he was very young to learn, can not have the slightest error; Wang performance is not very good, although the parents are disappointed, but his parents still encouraged his studies. A test, Xiao Ming test out of the points, the parents are very happy, kissed Xiao Ming, let him take the next full score; Wang did not pass the test, the parents are angry, playing a slap in the king, let him take a good point the next test. Wait until the next test, Xiao Ming did not test to the perfect score, the parents beat him a slap in the face, and the Wang scores increased, the parents of his one!
Two pairs of parents to treat their children's achievements in different practices, we can see the different manifestations of contemporary education. As the saying goes, "the golden rule of a good person," this idea is not all right, too much of the parents of their children on academic rigor, will eventually be counterproductive, will only make children tired of learning, if the parents of children a little more care, encouragement, greetings, On the heavy school after the children is a good comfort, after all, each parent is coming from the child stage, have had the same feeling! This cartoon first points to the family education, meaning love and punishment and its function. In my opinion, the two are not the right hand, and two kisses are right. Careful analysis, 100 points to get the kiss is a high score earned, is love, but the content of love is relatively simple, so 98 points will have to suffer a slap in the face; 55 minutes of the hand is wrong, parents rude, but 61 points Kiss special warm, rich content of love, affection, there is encouragement, tolerance and wait. From the effect, 98 children suffer from the palm of the hand may be cautious, learning mentality has been greatly damaged, will enter the more rigid state of mechanical learning, and may even create the spirit is suppressed, the next test into 90 points or even lower Are possible. But the kiss can be 61 points to become a driving force to form a positive spirit, the child's psychology will be in a more relaxed and healthy state of health, the future may have a good development, the next test scores will be higher almost Is certain.

What’s Greater Obamacare Or The Cost-effective Care Act? And Why It Matters.
Posted on 06/05/2017 03/05/2017 Author GinjelMU NjepatPosted in Health Care	
Civilized nations across the globe utilize a variety of types of universal or nationalized healthcare insurance programs. Our reform will prohibit insurance coverage organizations from denying coverage because of your medical history. The free market has done far more for the well being of the whole globe than all of the government programs combined. This consists of setting up health care proxies and advanced directives, exploring their wishes about resuscitation efforts, and discussing finish-of-life care options such as hospice.
If you do not have well being insurance coverage, you will ultimately have high quality, cost-effective possibilities as soon as we pass reform. Two fundamental ambitions of reform are vital-1) Universal coverage and 2)Control of skyrocketing cost increases. The responsibilities of the medical doctor is to diagnose the well being troubles that a individual may have and nurse them back to excellent wellness as long as it can be completed with the help of medicine and also treat injuries that a particular person could incur in their day to day lives.
Till I study your hub I had not known that France is rated 1st in the planet for health care. Following France on the Globe Health Organization’s list of rankings come 35 other nations before the United States comes in at 37th, just behind Costa Rica. Hoover Institution fellow Lanhee Chen explains why the American Health Care Reform Act bill failed and what may possibly take place next regarding health care.
I also agree that it’s genuinely sad that those who have never seem to care about these who never. Other countries allow private insurance coverage companies to exist as competitors, or as supplementation to the national plans to give additional coverage. Major care is frequently utilised as the term for the health care services which play a part in the local community.
Based on the nature of the wellness situation, sufferers may then be referred for secondary or tertiary care. We have the American Nurses Association and the American Healthcare Association on board, simply because our nation’s nurses and medical doctors know firsthand how badly we need reform. You may possibly be right about Cuba but in nations like the UK, Australia and NZ (and I would guess most European nations), it is a national sport to complain about the state overall health method (that is why you will see individuals above who have mentioned the systems are not excellent).

When You Can’t Afford Health Care
Posted on 04/09/2018 03/08/2018 Author GinjelMU NjepatPosted in Health Care	
This convenient, new service makes it possible to see a doctor on-line, anytime for non-emergency care. Since globalization of the health trade is at the moment in process, physicians from around the globe are collaborating in medical missions” to less developed nations to manage medical care. Most of the poor obtain socialized medication already in the type of Medicaid, so those who shouldn’t have it are within the service sector: maids, retail clerks, and many others. Quality well being care is the privilege of the well to do, and screw the waitress, the single mom, the hardworking laborer with a family of youngsters to help. ONE MORE THING I’D LIKE TO MENTION: I haven’t heard one thing talked about about psychological well being care.
The key areas of potential threat under the Federal Anti-Kickback statute also arise from pharmaceutical producer relationships with three groups: purchasers, physicians or other health care professionals, and gross sales agents. Looking at want verses entry, Florida ranked three out of fifty one for need exhibiting that the state has a decrease prevalence of behavioral well being concerns (Nguyen). Even so, the French enjoy a better mixture level of services and higher shopper satisfaction with a significantly lower stage of health expenditures, as a share of the GDP, than in the United States” (Rodwin, 2003, p. 35). The elder care recipient’s medical needs will determine asset and revenue requirements.
I wouldn’t be stunned to see many corporations regularly start to drop their firm sponsored health care insurance plans and easily pay the tax to the U.S. government to offer well being care insurance to their employees. You should ask the house well being care agency how they supervise their staff, and what sort of coaching their employees receive. These exchanges would be the vehicles used to ensure that each United States citizen has well being care coverage. We now have the chance to transform the system into one in all rewarding high quality of health care when it comes to wellness, successful medical outcomes, and patient satisfaction. Many plans particularly Health Savings Accounts could have had a family deductible of as much as $5000, however you paid everything as much as that amount. As a nation we are going to face much increased costs for medical and dental care as our inhabitants ages.
Most people might be required to acquire well being care insurance coverage or be forced to pay a tax. Place the elder care recipient with a trusted relative or in a respite care facility. The last time I wrote I instructed you that I had lost my medical health insurance, at age sixty three, and did find a free clinic referred to as the Open M Clinic. This new legislation was called the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (Government Relations Staff).
Hiring a home well being care employee directly is usually less expensive than hiring via a house health care agency; but when the elder care recipient is eligible and also you wish to use assistance from Medicare, you should hire someone by means of an authorized home well being care agency. Proposed preventative health care measures should also decrease costs in the long run and make these plans very engaging. Out of the 42.5 million adults within the United States that suffer from psychological illness, 41.four percent have reported that they have acquired some type of treatment (Nguyen). The brother went to Montfiore in NY, the sister went to a government medical middle in France.

Beyond Medicare: What Are Your Options?
Medicare is a valuable benefit, with average spending per beneficiary projected at $13,490 in 2018.1 Even so, Medicare covers only a little more than 60% of total health-care costs for Americans age 65 and older.2 Deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and payments for services not covered by Medicare can all add up to substantial out-of-pocket expenses. And there is no annual or lifetime out-of-pocket limit.
Whether you are enrolled in Medicare or planning to enroll in the future, you may want to consider two options to help manage out-of-pocket costs: Medigap and Medicare Advantage. Both are offered by private insurance companies approved and regulated by Medicare. They are mutually exclusive — you cannot be covered by both — but either might provide more stability to your health-care spending in retirement.
Supplemental Insurance
Medigap supplements coverage under Original Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance), and you must be enrolled in Part A and Part B in order to buy a Medigap policy. These policies pay all or a percentage of Medicare out-of-pocket costs such as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Some plans may pay for services not covered by Medicare, such as emergency medical care outside the United States (up to plan limits), but they generally do not cover long-term care, vision or dental care, hearing aids, or private-duty nursing. New Medigap policies do not cover prescription drugs, so you must enroll in Medicare Part D if you want prescription drug coverage.
Medigap plans are identified in most states by the letters A through N (E, H, I, and J are no longer available) in order to make comparison easier for consumers. All plans may not be offered in every state or by every insurance company, but plans identified by the same letter should offer the same benefits, though monthly premiums may differ.
You can enroll in a Medigap plan at any time, but the best time to do so is during the initial Medigap open enrollment period — the six-month period that begins on the first day of the month in which you are 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare Part B. During this time, you can buy any Medigap policy a company sells in your state for the same premium the company charges to healthy enrollees, even if you have health problems. If you miss this opportunity, an insurance company can charge you more for coverage or refuse coverage altogether, depending on your health. Medigap policies are guaranteed renewable; once you are enrolled, you cannot be denied coverage or charged more than healthy enrollees due to changes in your health.
A Medigap policy covers only one individual, so spouses need separate policies if both want coverage.
All-in-One Coverage
Medicare Advantage plans, also called Medicare Part C, replace Original Medicare Part A and Part B and often offer prescription drug coverage, similar to Medicare Part D. They may offer additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare such as dental care, eyeglasses, and wellness programs. Hospice care is covered under Original Medicare even if you have Medicare Advantage.
By enrolling in a Medicare Advantage plan, you are opting to receive benefits through a private insurance company, although much of the funding comes from the federal government. You will typically pay your Medicare Part B premium and an additional Part C premium, depending on the plan. You may also have out-of-pocket deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. However, all Medicare Advantage plans have an annual out-of-pocket maximum.
You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan instead of Original Medicare during your initial Medicare enrollment period — the seven-month period beginning three months before the month you turn 65. (Special enrollment rules apply if you have health insurance through your own or your spouse's employment.)
You can change coverage from Original Medicare to MA, or vice versa, or change between MA plans during Medicare's Open Enrollment period from October 15 to December 7. You can change from MA to Original Medicare during the disenrollment period from January 1 to February 14. From December 8 to November 30 of the following year, you can make one switch to a top-rated "5-star" MA plan.
For more information on Medigap, Medicare Advantage, and enrollment periods, see Medicare.gov.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has departed for Hanoi by train for talks with US President Donald Trump.
The much anticipated second US-North Korea summit is scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in the Vietnamese capital.
It follows a historic first round of talks last year in Singapore. All eyes will be on what if any progress is made towards "denuclearize".
The departure, confirmed by North Korean state media, is the first official acknowledgement that the talks are taking place.
The state media report said Kim would pay a "goodwill" visit to Vietnam as part of the trip.

Donald Trump to meet with Henry Kissinger
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee, seeking to boost his foreign policy knowledge, schedules meeting with former Sec. of State.

Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
Reuters
Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential front-runner, reportedly will meet with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
The meeting, first reported by the Washington Post, is scheduled to take place this week. Several news outlets confirmed the meeting.
Trump and Kissinger, 92, have spoken by telephone several times, according to the Post, but this would be their first face-to-face meeting.
Kissinger, a Holocaust refugee from Germany, served as national security adviser and secretary of state under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He has remained a prominent voice on U.S. foreign policy, particularly within the Republican Party, since leaving public office.
Trump has met with some party experts on foreign policy in an attempt to boost his knowledge in the field, especially in the wake of the announcement of his America First policy toward foreign affairs, according to reports.

DIVIDED AMERICA: GLOBAL WARMING POLARIZES MORE THAN ABORTION...

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tempers are rising in America, along with the temperatures...
Two decades ago, the issue of climate change wasn't as contentious. The leading U.S. Senate proponent of taking action on global warming was Republican John McCain. George W. Bush wasn't as zealous on the issue as his Democratic opponent for president in 2000, Al Gore, but he, too, talked of regulating carbon dioxide.
Then the Earth got even hotter , repeatedly breaking temperature records. But instead of drawing closer together, politicians polarized.
___
EDITOR'S NOTE — This story is part of Divided America, AP's ongoing exploration of the economic, social and political divisions in American society.
___
Democrats (and scientists) became more convinced that global warming was a real, man-made threat . But Republicans and Tea Party activists became more convinced that it was — to quote the repeated tweets of presidential nominee Donald Trump — a "hoax." A Republican senator tossed a snowball on the Senate floor for his proof.
When it comes to science, there's more than climate that divides America's leaders and people. The mainstream scientific establishment accepts evolution as a reality, as well as the general safety of vaccinations and genetically modified food. But some political leaders and portions of the public don't believe any of that. It's not a liberal versus conservative issue, especially when it comes to vaccinations, which are doubted by some activists on both ends of the political spectrum.
But nothing beats climate change for divisiveness.

"It's more politically polarizing than abortion," says Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. "It's more politically polarizing than gay marriage."
Leiserowitz says 17 percent of Americans, the fastest-growing group, are alarmed by climate change and want action now, based on surveys by Yale and George Mason University.
Another 28 percent are concerned, thinking it's a man-made threat, but somewhat distant in time and place. Twenty-seven percent are cautious, still on the fence, and 11 percent are doubtful. An often-vocal 10 percent are dismissive, rejecting the concept of warming and the science. And about 7 percent are disengaged, not even paying attention because they've got more pressing needs.
So while the largest group is at least concerned with climate change, significant segments are not. And sometimes those segments mix in one family.
Rick and Julie Joyner of Fort Mill, South Carolina, are founders of MorningStar ministries. Most of the people they associate with reject climate change. Their 31-year-old daughter, Anna Jane, is a climate change activist.
Rick Joyner, 66, would visit New York with other evangelicals to meet with Trump and then hear a completely different world view from his daughter.
As part of a documentary a few years ago, Anna Jane introduced Rick to scientists who made the case for climate change. It did not work. He labels himself more skeptical than before.
"They're both stubborn and equally entrenched in their positions," says Julie, who is often in the middle. "It doesn't get ugly too often."

TRIBALISM
Recall the 20th century, with its race to the moon, advances in medicine and information technology, and "this incredibly strong belief in the promise of science," says Matthew Nisbet, a communications professor at Northeastern University.
People in the 1960s "had faith in science, had hope in science. Most people thought science was responsible for improving their daily lives," says Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences. So some scientists look back at that era with nostalgia, she says.
That's because now, Nisbet says, "we see partisan polarization or ideological polarization" and the implications of science "are intuitively recognized as threatening to one side and their world view."
Yale psychology and law professor Dan Kahan argues, however, that public divides on science have existed for decades. He notes that some issues that formerly divided us no longer do, such as the dangers of cigarettes, after a public health campaign eroded the social acceptability of smoking.
The split with science is most visible and strident when it comes to climate change because the nature of the global problem requires communal joint action, and "for conservatives that's especially difficult to accept," Nisbet says.

Liberals believe in global warming, conservatives
Climate change is more about tribalism, or who we identify with politically and socially, Nisbet and other experts say. Liberals believe in global warming, conservatives don't.
Dave Woodard, a Clemson University political science professor and GOP consultant, helped South Carolina Republican Bob Inglis run for the U.S. House (successfully) and the Senate (unsuccessfully). They'd meet monthly at Inglis' home for Bible study, and were in agreement that global warming wasn't an issue and probably was not real.
"I said climate change was nonsense, Al Gore's imagination," Inglis says.
After seeing the effects of warming first-hand in Antarctica and Australia's Great Barrier Reef, Inglis changed his mind — and was overwhelmingly defeated in a GOP primary in 2010. Woodard helped run the campaign that beat him and hasn't been to his former friend's home for about a decade.
"I was seen as crossing to the other side, as helping the Al Gore tribe, and that could not be forgiven," Inglis says.
Woodward responds that the new Bob Inglis didn't fit South Carolina.
"If you want to talk climate change, you need to go up to New York and Boston to do that. You don't talk that down here," he says. "Conservatives just don't believe. They think it's like Martians."
Judy Curry, a Georgia Tech atmospheric scientist and self-described climate gadfly, has experienced ostracism from the other side. She repeatedly clashed with former colleagues after she publicly doubted the extent of global warming and criticized the way mainstream scientists operate. Now she says, no one will even look at her for other jobs in academia.
"What's wrong with disagreement? People disagree. You listen or you don't," Curry says. "This polarization comes down to being intolerant on disagreement."
WHAT CHANGED
In 1997, then-Vice President Gore helped broker an international treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, to reduce heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and gas. The U.S. later withdrew from the treaty.
"And at that moment" says Leiserowitz, "the two parties begin to divide. They begin to split and go farther and farther and farther apart until we reach today's environment where climate change is now one of the most polarized issues in America."
The election of Barack Obama and the Tea Party revolt made the schism even bigger, he says.
Stanford University's Jon Krosnick agrees that things changed around 1997, but he thinks Americans are fairly united — it's just they don't realize it. Krosnick's surveys show that nearly 90 percent of Democrats, 80 percent of independents and 70 percent of Republicans believe the increase in world's temperature over the past century was mostly or partly caused by humans.
His studies show fairly consistent numbers, except for a drop in Republicans to 50 percent in 2011 that since has returned to 70 percent.
A bigger split in Stanford surveys indicates that while about 90 percent of Democrats and 80 percent of independents believe global warming will be a serious or very serious problem for the United States, barely half of Republicans feel that way.
To illustrate how the issue plays out in all sorts of ways, let's take lobster scientist Diane Cowan in Friendship, Maine, who expresses dismay.
"I am definitely bearing witness to climate change," Cowan says. "I read about climate change. I knew sea level was rising but I saw it and, until it impacted me directly, I didn't feel it the same way."
Republican Jodi Crosson, a 55-year-old single mother and production and sales manager in Bexley, Ohio, thinks global warming is a serious problem because she's felt the wrath of extreme weather and rising heat. But to her, it's not quite as big an issue as the economy.
And then there's Ken Martig Jr. An engineer and business owner in Allyn, Washington, he paid little attention to global warming until he learned that one proposed solution involved regulations and taxes. Now he doesn't think climate change is man-made or a major worry.
"If you put it down to one word today, it's a trust issue," the 73-year-old Martig says. "Do you really know for a fact that it's burning of the (fossil) fuels that are creating these greenhouse gases" that are causing the world to warm?
Scott Tiller, a 59-year-old underground coal miner in West Virginia, has seen mine after mine close, and he agrees with Martig.
"I think we've been treated unfairly and kind of looked down upon as polluters," Tiller says. "They say the climate is changing, but are we doing it? Or is it just a natural thing that the Earth does?"
BRIDGING DIFFERENCES
Overwhelmingly, scientists who study the issue say it is man-made and a real problem. Using basic physics and chemistry and computer simulations, scientists have repeatedly calculated how much extra warming is coming from natural forces and how much comes from humans. The scientists and their peer-reviewed research blame human activity, for the most part.
Dozens of scientific measurements show Earth is warming. Since 1997, the world has warmed by 0.44 degrees (0.25 degrees Celsius) and 51 monthly or annual global heat records were broken, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Arctic sea ice, ice sheets and glaciers are melting faster. The seas have risen and hot water has been killing coral in record numbers. Scientists have connected man-made climate change to extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours. Allergies, asthma and pest-borne diseases are worsening public health problems, with experts blaming climate change.

Scientists keep acting as if they just do a better job showing data or teaching, then people can understand that climate change is a problem — and that's just not the way people work, says Yale's Kahan.
He points to polling showing that if you ask people if scientists are sure global warming is real, man-made and a threat, they'll say yes.
"They know that scientists say we're screwed," Kahan says. "But it's not what activates them."
Twice in the last seven years, scientific societies sent group letters to Congress explaining that warming is real, man-made threat.
"I honestly believe that low science literacy allows people to fall for things that make no sense," says University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. "For example, when it is cold or a snowy day, I may get a comment like 'There is 20 inches of global warming in my yard.' While that is a cute, snarky comment, it really illustrates a lack of understanding of weather versus climate."
Kahan says the most ardent doubters of climate change are also among the best-educated groups on the science — along with the most ardent believers. They are driven by ideology, he says.
So instead of spouting statistics, some climate activists and even scientists try to build bridges to communities that might doubt that the Earth is warming but are not utterly dismissive.
The more people connect on a human level, the more people can "overcome these tribal attitudes," Anna Jane Joyner says. "We really do have a lot more in common than we think."
Disagreement is OK, says her father, Rick.
"True unity is not a unity in conformity, but a unity in diversity," he says. "We look at differences as an opportunity to learn, not to divide."

Where you are: Home / Interior design: what décor style matches your personality?
Search for:
Updating your interior design has become a recurrent and persistent thought that you simply cannot eliminate from your mind. During the past weeks, you have been reading magazines, home décor books and online blogs in order to decide the style that you want to infuse into your personal living space, but you still have not managed to reach a final conclusion. This is quite understandable taking into account the numerous décor styles available, from bohemian, traditional, contemporary, minimalist and eclectic to mid-century modern, industrial, rustic and Scandinavian. Each of them captivates the eye and tells a story, but not all of them suit your personality. Therefore, this should become the main criterion when approaching the selection process. Look at your wardrobe to identify your fashion style, consider your hobbies, the activities you like to do and the architecture the house. This will allow you to find the specific décor style that will bring your interior design into prominence.
Choose the style that matches your tastes
Furthermore, become familiar with the basics of each style so that you make a list with the rules that you have to observe in order to achieve your goal. For instance, the bohemian look focuses on meaningful individuality. This means that you have the freedom to express yourself through unusual displays and colorful elements. You can add tartan ribbon UK in various areas of the house because it represents a cheap and versatile decorative element. Similar décor styles that allow you to play with textures and patterns involve eclectic, cottage, Moroccan and even vintage. On the other hand, industrial style reminds of primitive surroundings. More exactly, gathering natural and worn-down materials, sticking with neutral colors and avoiding accessories represent the main indications that you must follow. Similar decor styles refer to Scandinavian, minimalist and contemporary.
Determine the style that suits your budget
Another aspect that you simply cannot overlook is your budget. You probably already realized that certain styles require unique expensive items for achieving that high-end look while others are more suitable for limited budgets. Therefore, after analyzing the styles and determining the ones that you like the most, you have two options: compromise and go with one that will not force you to declare bankruptcy or get the necessary money to invest in a more demanding but more striking one. If you choose the latter, you might have to postpone the project until you feel financially stable.

No True Recovery in U.S. Stock Market Without Recovery in Real Estate
Companies / Company Chart Analysis Jan 14, 2011 - 01:36 PM GMT
By: Christopher_Quigley
There can be no true recovery in the American stock market without a recovery in real estate. The property companies that I follow are all showing signs of solid strength and momentum.
This significant development indicates that the bull trend that commenced in March 2009, though in overbought territory at the moment and due a correction, is still very much in place.
Accordingly we will probably see the former highs in the Dow 30, Dow 20, NASDAQ 100 and S & P 5600 tested this year and on balance theses former key technical points will be breached. Thus nearly two years after the move initially commenced a formal Dow Theory “New Bull Market Buy Signal” can finally be announced to the world.

What’s The Worst That Could Happen?: I Am Not An Economist - Basic Income
What’s The Worst That Could Happen?
The running thoughts of Matthew Janes
Sunday, April 10, 2016
I Am Not An Economist - Basic Income
Despite not being an economist, I am someone who cares about politics and reads far too much news from sources such as Bloomberg, Fortune, WSJ, The Economist, etc. Thus, I have opinions about economic policy. For this week's thinking to myself, I wanted to go over an econ policy idea that has been making itself increasingly loudly heard through some corners of the net. See YCombinator, Reddit with r/BasicIncome, Vox's parade of articles on the subject, etc.
For those of you who don't read over my shoulder everything I skim on the internet, what exactly is a basic income? Wikipedia has the intro on basic income covered, but as I have seen it presented, the idea is to give every citizen, or every citizen at age of majority, a direct income. Simply a check every month or similar, with no means testing, generally so as to replace all, or most other, social programs such as social security, food stamps, welfare, etc. The amount of money that would be paid out in such a system is up for debate, with some arguing that it should be enough to survive on, and others wanting just a baseline level of aid. The minimal level of aid could be along the lines of what is already done with the Alaska Permanent Fund, or Norway's similar distribution of oil revenue through the Government Pension Fund of Norway.
Firstly, what is the reason one would want to do this? Looking at the collection of American law and regulation designed to provide aid and a reliable source of income, I see a complicated mess. As a software developer, it is the sort of situation that makes me dream of throwing it out and rewriting it from scratch, in as simplistic and direct a way as possible. Giving the same amount of money to everyone, through one singular program, with no means testing, is pretty much that ideal. Presuming it works, and is affordable, of course.
So, what might the benefits be? Beyond the simplifying of bureaucracy, there are, theoretically, a number. The system, being so simple, would be harder to corrupt. Furthermore, it removes a good share of the perverse incentives seen with many welfare systems. If you only get aid when you are below the poverty line, getting an income that would boost you above the poverty line is, if not a negative, is less of a positive than it would otherwise be.
The overall goal, of providing aid, and putting a floor on poverty is, in my mind, necessary. We've got a vast proportion of our population that's in poverty or unfortunately close to poverty. Wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated. There's a lot of risk in the future that jobs will be wiped out faster than people can train for new ones. Giving every citizen an equal amount of money will help equalize things and prevent abject poverty and social stratification.
There is the question of what to set the level of payments at. If set too low, you are providing less aid than with current systems, and some people are losing out. If set too high, you create a system that we cannot afford, and discourages people from wanting to work at all. Much as I would like to hope otherwise, I think we're at least a few years away from the futuristic utopia where robots do most of the work and we can all get by on five weeks of work a year. Maybe not too far, but not something we can just start tomorrow.
So, what could this basic income level be set at? Of all the papers about it I've seen on the net, I've seen very few with direct numbers.
As a first thought experiment, what would happen with a revenue neutral basic income? Do not change current tax rates, or total social program spending. Simply get rid of social security, food stamps, minimum wage, welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, etc, and just give every citizen a check each month. What happens then?
For the roughest of back of the napkin calculations, bear in mind I'm not an economist, it looks like we spend ~2.25-2.5 trillion per year on the programs I mentioned. And there are ~320 million Americans, ~240 million of them over the age of 18. So, if we gave each of them an even distribution of that money, that would be approximately, $10,00 a year for citizen over the age of 18. That actually lines up fairly well with what New Zealand, Finland, Canada, and the Netherlands are experimenting with,
Not enough to get by on, certainly, which mostly avoids the problem of discouraging people from working, but how would the end result work, and who suffers? If you're giving this money out to all citizens instead of some subset of citizens, there are going to be people getting less money. Looking into that, I realized that I had no idea what the max social security distribution is in the US. Apparently it's about $2,639, for people who have contributed the maximum taxable earnings for 35 working years. For maximum benefits through welfare, SNAP, Medicaid, etc, I have even less of an idea, but after a brief internet search looks like for some people is greater than one thousand a month.
Distributing all this money perfectly evenly, instead of targeting it, would thus, of course, create a number of winners and losers. Despite the efficiency gains of such a program, a number of people currently hurting the most, would have aid reduced.
Furthermore, what are the efficiency gains? There are all the potential benefits of removing perverse incentives, but measuring that is mostly up to ambiguous econ theory to debate, Then, how many fewer people would it take to administer such a program? As not-an-economist, and spending a few seconds looking on the web, I see the US currently employs 62,000 people in the Social Security Administration, and after that, sifting through docs from OPM gets complicated. I imagine a good number of jobs would no longer be needed, but hardly enough to have a sizable impact on the amount of payout such a system would be able to give.
What if you wanted to increase the amount of basic income, in order to compensate for those losing out due to decreased payments? As a basic income is being given to all people, tax burdens on people not currently receiving aid, but who would under a basic income system, could be increased without changing their effective income levels, but then it all becomes a question of tax policy.
I love the aesthetics of such a basic income plan, its ideals, and basic argument, but still need more details to have any idea how it would actually work. Glad they are experimenting with it in other parts of the world, and look forward to seeing what happens.

The ideal way to fund it would be to tax carbon/pollution, resource extraction, and anything related to the commons/public land. Those revenues would fund a "Citizen's Dividend Fund." Ideally this would grow over time and pay out dividends to each citizens.
Another source of funds would be taxing financial speculation (the Robin Hood Tax), which would be a small "sales tax" on the high-risk speculative financial trading and derivatives, etc (less than 1% could generate a lot of income) - these are the same things that lead to the Great recession and currently are not taxed. Taxing them would temper the risk a bit and potentially provide a lot of income for government programs.
Doing those things, we could reduce income taxes on the poor and middle class (while ratcheting up on the rich, to temper inequality).
All-in-all there are a lot of revenue streams that should be tapped anyway.
I disagree with removing all social services. Services like SNAP, disability assistance, and even welfare, are important to those less advantaged. Social Security and Medicare are both vital programs that should stay as well - both are funded fully or partially by all citizens. Social Security is a retirement program all working Americans fund, and are then able receive pay based on how much we've contributed - it's our money!
We could, however, remove some other tax burdens that are regressive - like sales taxes, income taxes (unless it's a large income and contributes to inequality), etc.

Big in Japan
Posted by Iannucci | 11/20/2007 | 1 comments »
When you have the talent you can race anything, and Tony Kanaan has the talent. We don't know if he can dance, but we do know he can drive the wheels off pretty much any open-wheel vehicle he gets his hands on. Case in point, this past weekend's Formula Nippon race at Suzuka, Japan.
The 2004 IndyCar Series champion advanced 12 positions to finish sixth in the Japan Formula Nippon finale at Suzuka Circuit last weekend. Kanaan had never driven at the track -- or driven the Formula Nippon car – before the first of two practice sessions.
"I was pleased at the end of the day, after all I gained 12 positions in the race," said Kanaan, who won the IndyCar Series race at Twin Ring Motegi in April. "The (standing) start especially was difficult, since I hadn't done one in 12 years."
(MORE from IndyCar.com)
Just for giggles, note that Kanaan's sixth place matches the best finish by new teammate Hideki Mutoh in his three races at Suzuka in the 2006 Formula Nippon series. There's nothing more to say there.

By TERRY TANG
Associated Press
PHOENIX (AP) — Police served a search warrant Tuesday to get DNA from all male employees at a long-term care facility in Phoenix where a patient who had been in a vegetative state for years gave birth, triggering reviews by state agencies and putting a spotlight on safety concerns for patients who are severely disabled or incapacitated.
Hacienda HealthCare said it welcomed the DNA testing of employees.
"We will continue to cooperate with Phoenix Police and all other investigative agencies to uncover the facts in this deeply disturbing, but unprecedented situation," the company said in a statement.
Local news website Azfamily.com first reported the woman, who had been in a vegetative state for more than 10 years after a near-drowning, delivered a baby on Dec. 29.
San Carlos Apache officials announced Tuesday night that the 29-year-old woman was an enrolled member of the tribe, whose reservation is in southeastern Arizona about 134 miles (215 kilometers) east of Phoenix.
In a statement, tribal officials said the woman was still in a vegetative state when she gave birth.
The woman's name was redacted from the tribal statement. It's also unclear if staff members at the facility were aware of her pregnancy until the birth.
"On behalf of the tribe, I am deeply shocked and horrified at the treatment of one of our members," tribal chairman Terry Rambler said. "When you have a loved one committed to palliative care, when they are most vulnerable and dependent upon others, you trust their caretakers. Sadly, one of her caretakers was not to be trusted and took advantage of her. It is my hope that justice will be served."
A lawyer for the woman's family released a statement Tuesday saying the family was outraged at the "neglect of their daughter" and they asked for privacy.
"The family would like me to convey that the baby boy has been born into a loving family and will be well cared for," Phoenix attorney John Micheaels said in a statement.
San Carlos Apache Police Chief Alejandro Benally said Phoenix police "will do all they can to find the perpetrator" and his department will assist "in any way possible."
A spokesman for Hacienda HealthCare said investigators served a search warrant Tuesday to obtain DNA samples from all male staffers.
In a statement, board member Gary Orman said the facility "will accept nothing less than a full accounting of this absolutely horrifying situation."
"We will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of every single one of our patients and our employees," Orman said.
Hacienda CEO Bill Timmons stepped down Monday, spokesman David Leibowitz said. The decision was unanimously accepted by the provider's board of directors.
Gov. Doug Ducey's office has called the situation "deeply troubling."
Phoenix police so far have declined comment.
The Hacienda facility serves infants, children and young adults who are "medically fragile" or have developmental disabilities, according to the website. In the wake of the reports, the Arizona Department of Health Services said new safety measures have been implemented. They include increased staff presence during any patient interaction, more monitoring of patient care areas and additional security measures involving visitors.
The state's online complaint database for care facilities shows multiple complaints about Hacienda de Los Angeles going back to 2013. Most of them involve fire drill and evacuation preparation or Medicaid eligibility. But one complaint from December 2013 outlines an allegation that a staff member made inappropriate sexual comments about four patients two months earlier. Nobody relayed the incidents to an administrator. That employee was later fired.
Martin Solomon, a personal injury attorney in Phoenix whose clients are mostly vulnerable adult victims of abuse and neglect, said a lawyer representing this woman should call for all pertinent medical records, a list of current and ex-employees and any past litigation involving Hacienda. It would be the police who would lead DNA testing to figure out who fathered the baby, Solomon said.
It would be hard for Hacienda to escape any kind of liability in court.
"There's a lot of information we do not have. But things like this don't happen without someone either knowing about it or should have known about it," Solomon said. "Whether it's an employee or someone from the outside, the facility has an obligation to protect residents."
Advocates for the disabled say Arizona needs to find a way to monitor allegations of sexual abuse and sexual violence in group settings. Doing background checks isn't enough, said Erica McFadden, executive director of the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Planning Council.
"I think when you've had somebody who's had multiple allegations from different parties, there has to be some way to track that," McFadden said. "If it's the same story from different people, then there's something wrong."
The council recently formed a task force to look at how to improve training for health care workers when it comes to identifying and reporting sexual abuse.
"We don't have a systematic way to train people what's a good touch or a bad touch. We also don't have required training for providers," McFadden said. "We really need a lot of work in this area."
Jon Meyers, executive director of The Arc of Arizona, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, called the allegations "disturbing, to put it mildly."
"I wasn't there. I clearly don't have firsthand knowledge of what happened," Meyers said. "But I can't believe someone receiving that level of constant care wasn't recognized as being pregnant prior to the time she delivered."

April goes blue for autism in Tupelo
Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal - 4/2/2018
April 02--Tupelo will go blue in April to lift up the Autism Center of North Mississippi and the families it serves.
"Every year it gets bigger and bigger," said Brittany Cuevas, the center's director of business development and administration. "It's exciting to see Tupelo get more and move involved."
Today, Tupelo Parks and Recreation Department will host a Burger Frenzy behind Tupelo City Hall. On April 7, the center will host its annual 5K at Ballard Park. In Mantachie, Crossfit White Horse will host the Pick up the Pieces Autism 5K on April 28.
Local restaurants are hosting special events with proceeds benefiting the autism center. Businesses purchase T-shirts to support the center and host blue jeans day fundraisers to help the center. A Facebook campaign is sharing the experiences of families dealing with autism.
"It's pretty cool," Cuevas said. "We want the whole community to embrace autism."
Autism covers a spectrum of developmental disorders that impact a child's ability to communicate and interact. There are nearly 11,000 children in Mississippi with autism spectrum disorders. Early, intensive intervention is considered the best opportunity to impact a child's future ability to learn and function, Cuevas said.
"There are so many families in Mississippi who can't access services because they're aren't enough providers," Cuevas said.
After years of advocacy work, the center is now receiving Medicaid reimbursements to help pay for applied behavioral analysis therapies.
"We're grateful for the progress we're making," Cuevas said.
However, Mississippi's Medicaid reimbursement levels are much lower than neighboring states, and it's hard to attract and retain the certified staff needed to treat more children, Cuevas said.
"The autism center will have to continue to rely on grants and fundraising," Cuevas said. "We will need other funds to offset the costs."

En el ámbito europeo donde la neutralidad de Red, al menos de momento, parece protegida el foco legislativo se centrará durante 2018 en la protección de datos. Tras la aprobación de la “General Data Protection Regulation (GDRP) la Comisión Europea ha presentado una propuesta para un nuevo Reglamento de privacidad electrónica (e-privacy) que entrará en vigor conjuntamente con la GDRP y que será de aplicación para todos los datos relacionados con las comunicaciones electrónicas.

The Sevier County Sheriff’s Office operates two Correctional Facilities:
The Sevier County Jail is located at 137 Commerce Street
Sevierville, TN 37862.
The Sevier County Jail opened in June, 1991 with an original inmate capacity of 156.

After an expansion in 2010, the Sevier County Jail (Annex) now has a capacity of 356.
​The Sevier County Sheriff’s Office Correctional Service is comprised of dedicated, professional, law enforcement administrators, supervisors, corrections officers, and a support staff that possess the knowledge, skills, understanding, and experience necessary to achieve efficient jail operations. Each facility offers a safe, secure, well-maintained environment for the inmate population as well as staff and the surrounding Communities.
​The Sevier County Correctional Facilities meet professional standards for certification through the Tennessee Corrections Institute (TCI). In addition, all Sevier County Sheriff’s Office Correctional Staff must attend 40 hours of in-service training annually with a focus on basic training, safety, liability, correctional law, personnel management, planning, and operations.
In 2016 the Sevier County Sheriff implemented the Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT) to help with emergency situations that may occur inside the Sevier County Jails. This team is comprised of 8 Corrections Officers with specialized training in Defensive Tactics, Less Lethal Weapon Systems, Riot and Crowd Control as well as Cell Extractions and searches. The officers on this team are held to elevated level of professionalism as well as training which occurs monthly. Officers assigned to this team are on call 24/7 to respond to any situation.

LA Kings Mascot Sued For Groping Man's Buttocks
A lawsuit has been brought against the Los Angeles Kings and their mascot lion named Bailey for an alleged groping that took place in the Staples Center elevator in 2016. A plaintiff is a man named Maso Griffin and he claims he was fired from his job after complaining to his human resources director, who is also incidentally married to the man behind the mascot.
Griffin claims the mascot played by Tim Smith put one hand on his shoulder and the other hand squeezed his buttocks while riding on an elevator. Smith happens to be married to Melissa Smith who is the human resources director for Levy Restaurants. Griffin says in the suit, which also names Kings' owner Anschutz Entertainment Group Inc., and Compass Group USA, he reported the incident to Melissa Smith the next day but she only became angry and eventually removed him from the schedule and fired him on December 21.
The suit says coworkers made fun of him after saying things like, "Was his hand furry?" The Kings issued a statement over the lawsuit saying, "We are aware of the lawsuit filed by Mr. Griffin against AEG, Levy Restaurants, Compass Group and Tim Smith. The allegations which are the subject of that lawsuit were thoroughly investigated nearly a year ago when they were first raised by this plaintiff.
Michael Altieri, senior vice president of communications and broadcasting for AEG Sports and the Kings, defended the furry mascot, "Those allegations were then - just as they are now - without any merit. Mr. Smith is an active figure in this community and a positive representative of our organization. We will vigorously defend ourselves in this matter"

Florida Man Uses Large Dildo to Fight Cops
Sometimes, you have no option left but to use everything available at your disposal in order to win.
That's exactly what 71-year-old Donald Hornback did when the police were dispatched to remove him for falling asleep on another man's land.
Hornback was awakened by multiple Deputies from the Martin County Sheriff's Office, who then attempted to tell him that he had to leave the premises.
<img src="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/564da6541ea23b13f1a80e1fff2c43c603ed0112a29205edfbba60c72da740e9.jpg" style="max-height:640px;max-width:360px;">
Despite their efforts, Hornback wasn't having any of it, telling the lawmen they “had no right to remove him from the property.”
That's when Hornback gathered up his belongings into his backpack, as an apparent transient who was drifting, and according to police he then “picked up a large dildo and began to swing it around at the officers and the victim on scene.”
<img src="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/577faef8039ac72cdcf7a005332c2d3a7e0c3195160e51160427e3f26ba81f98.jpg" style="max-height:640px;max-width:360px;">
Fortunately for Hornback, the officers didn't view the use of a sex toy as a “deadly weapon”, so they disarmed him without using deadly force and took him into custody.
He's now facing trespassing charges, a misdemeanor, and was subsequently released on a $750 bond; only to reappear in court on December 14th, according to<a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/trespassing/another-florida-dildont-803542">The Smoking Gun</a>.

Will collaborate to develop XmAb5871.
‘We are delighted to really have the possibility to partner with Xencor in discovering their novel immunomodulatory approach.’ ‘Amgen’s long-time leadership in antibody development for oncology and inflammatory diseases aligns seamlessly with Xencor’s pipeline development,’ said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., ceo of Xencor. ‘We anticipate that XmAb5871 will soon end up being the 5th XmAb-engineered antibody in clinical development. This program is definitely a testament to the improvement we’ve made expanding the XmAb system into autoimmune disease with our CD32b technology, which reaches the primary of the XmAb5871 substance.Lipids, like cholesterol, are usually associated with illness. But in modern times, researchers can see that not absolutely all lipids are harmful to you, like the very much touted omega-3 essential fatty acids that are located in fish natural oils. The discovered lipids newly, known as fatty acid hydroxy essential fatty acids, or FAHFAs, were low in humans with first stages of diabetes and had been higher in mice resistant to diabetes. ‘Predicated on their biology, we are able to add FAHFAs to the tiny list of helpful lipids,’ says Alan Saghatelian, Salk professor in the Clayton Base Laboratories for Peptide Biology and among the senior authors of the task.

Lee Greenwood has performed “God Bless the USA” for five sitting Presidents (Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush) and at three presidential inaugurations, plus the Make America Great Again Welcome Celebration just one day ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration.
Greenwood has some advice for his fellow performers, saying...“I would advise inauguration performers to live the moment … It will be a moment that they just have to bathe in,” Greenwood tells Variety, adding, “Remember what you have to do — and do it with eloquence.”
Greenwood performed “God Bless the USA” at the Welcome Celebration; he was “thrilled” to do so, and “had no trouble” with President-elect Trump using the song during his campaign. In fact, Greenwood says that he believes the numerous artists who have declined to be part of Trump’s inauguration festivities will 'regret not going in the future'...going on to say 'You don’t get this invitation very often,” later adding, “I feel sorry for people who would turn down this invitation.”
Greenwood continues, “You need to support Trump and all the things he plans to do for America, and not bow down to what is said on social media and gossip … I live here in a rural community in Nashville, and I frequent a lot of local places … No one comes up to me and says, ‘Why are you going? Why are you singing for the president?’”

Smith Statement on Equal Pay Day
Congressman Adam Smith released the following statement on Equal Pay Day:
April 12, 2016
“We must close the gender pay gap. Despite the many positive transformative changes in our nation’s workforce, women still get paid less for equal work and make 79 cents for every dollar earned compared to their male counterparts. This disparity particularly impacts women of color and cannot continue.
“Equal Pay Day symbolizes how much more the average woman in the United States must work to earn what a man earned in the previous year. Today marks these extra 103 days, a day where we recognize how much work remains to achieve pay equality. In addition to wage disparities, women are shut out of leadership and management roles far too often. As women continue to make up a growing percentage of our workforce, the gender wage gap is an increasing burden to working families and will limit our nation’s future economic success.
“As we recognize Equal Pay Day, we must continue fighting for policies that move us towards a fairer and more equal society. Congress must implement policies that address the wage gap, such as the Paycheck Fairness Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation that would help ensure women are paid equally for equal work. We also must expand access to affordable child care and paid family leave that can further help women enter and remain in the workforce. When women succeed, America succeeds.”

How does friendship influence childhood well-being and positive behaviors?
Sunday, November 3, 2013
Christine Schurawel, Health Sciences, California State University Dominguez Hills, Carson, CA
Enrique Ortega, PhD MPH, Health Sciences, California State University Dominguez Hills, Carson, CA

Background: Studies have shown that childhood friendships are important for healthy social development and well-being. The purpose of this study was to investigate which friendship practices were associated with the development of pro-social behaviors, emotional instability, and aggressiveness among a sample of Italian children. Methods: The sample consisted of 334 children (48% boys, 52% girls) who were 8 to 10 years old (M=9.38; SD=0.89) attending the second (30%), third (53%) and fourth (17%) grades of primary schools in urban and suburban areas of northern Italy. Linear regressions were used to explore the associations of among our variables of interest utilizing three waves of data. Age, gender, and baseline measures were used as covariates in the analysis. Results: Results indicated that concurrent emotional instability was positively associated with conflict (β = 0.67, p < 0.001). Likewise Aggression was concurrently associated with conflict (β = .78, p < 0.001) and negatively associated with intimacy (β = -.19, p < 0.05). Finally pro-social behaviors were concurrently positively associated with intimacy (β = .25, p < 0.001), security (β = .14, p < 0.001) receiving help (β = .17, p < 0.001), and negatively associated with conflict (β = -0.10, p < 0.001). No longitudinal associations were identified. Conclusions: Such findings could assist program planners in the development of programs that enhance positive friendship practices for the development of childhood wellbeing. Further investigation is needed which could further enhance our understanding of the role that friendship has on behavioral problems.
Learning Areas:
Planning of health education strategies, interventions, and programs
Learning Objectives:
Identify childhood friendship practices associated with positive development. Explain possible antecedents of childhood pro-social behaviors. Differentiate possible US and European childhood well-being correlates.

Element Description MLTSS Program Medicaid Managed Specialty Supports and Services Concurrent 1915(b)/(c) Waiver Program
Quality in Managed Long-Term Services and Supports Programs. VII. Discussion
Diversity is a hallmark of the state-federal Medicaid program. The saying goes: "If you've seen one Medicaid program, you've seen one Medicaid program." In terms of MLTSS quality, the same holds true to a large extent. CMS has always accorded states discretion in the design and operation of their Medicaid programs, including quality monitoring, as

Medicaid and Permanent Supportive Housing for Chronically Homeless Individuals: Emerging Practices From the Field. Notes
PSH is a phenomenon of the 1990s and 2000s, when homelessness assistance systems evolved and their goals shifted and changed. PSH beds available to end people's homelessness went from about zero in the late 1980s to estimates of 114,000 beds in fall 1996 (Burt et al. 1999), about 188,000 beds in January 2007, and 284,298 beds in January 2013 (H
Medicaid and Permanent Supportive Housing for Chronically Homeless Individuals: Emerging Practices From the Field. 8.4. Coverage for Services to Address Substance Use Disorders
In states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a significant number of adults who are eligible because their incomes are low enough to qualify (up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level) are likely to have substance use disorders. The Affordable Care Act includes services for substance use d

Type of Activity: Direct and contract health care is provided for individuals incarcerated in Bureau of Indian Affairs jails, most of which (62 of 78 jails) are managed by Tribes under P.L. 93-638 compacts or contracts.
Funding Mechanism: Included in the local IHS or Tribal health budget. Bureau of Indian Affairs has no health authority or budget.
Total Available Funding: Small, but unknown
Number of Awards: N/A
Award Amount: N/A
Length of Project Period: N/A
Federal Partners: Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
Summary: The IHS and Tribes provide intermittent direct health care services (medical, dental, mental health, substance abuse, etc) to individuals incarcerated in BIA/Tribal jails (total average daily inmate population for all 78 jails is 2,100). IHS/Tribes may also pay for health care services provided by the private sector through Contract Health Services (CHS) funding if the inmate is CHS eligible and if the care falls within the local medical priorities for care.
Background: Since the Bureau of Indian Affairs has no health authority or funding, all health care for incarcerated individuals may be referred to the IHS or Tribal Health facility and served subject to eligibility and medical priority for either direct or contract care. There is no separate funding for these activities. Inmates have a very high incidence of substance abuse as well as HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Health care may be provided on-site or at a local IHS/Tribal or private sector health facilities.

Assisted Living San Bruno
San Bruno city is located in San Mateo County, California State, US.
Assisted living in San Bruno as it exists today emerged in the 1990s as an California eldercare alternative on the continuum of care for people, for whom independent living is not appropriate but who do not need the 24-hour medical care provided by a nursing home and are too young to live in a retirement home. Assisted living is a philosophy of care and services promoting independence and dignity.
San Bruno Time Zone is PST and Area code, to make phone calls to a San Bruno Assisted Living Home, is 650

San Bruno Assisted Living - California
Zip Code is 94066 and Currently there are 1 assisted living homes and senior care homes in our database for San Bruno City.
A distinction is generally made between San Bruno medical and non-medical care, care provided by people who are not medical professionals. The latter is much less likely to be covered by insurance or public funds. In the US, 67% of the one million or so residents in assisted living facilities pay for care out of their own funds. The rest get help from family and friends and from state agencies. Medicare does not pay unless skilled-nursing care is needed and given in certified skilled nursing facilities or by a skilled nursing agency in the home.
San Bruno Assisted living facilities usually do not meet Medicares requirements. However, Medicare does pay for some skilled care if the elderly person meets the requirements for the Medicare home health benefit.

Oral Essentials Original formula for bad breath is just what you’d expect; the ultimate weapon for fresh breath! Our Original formula was the brainchild of 2 forward thinking dentists who wanted a more natural solution to oral care that still yielded powerful results and tasted great. This revolutionary product was the first of its kinds, combining Dead Sea salt with French essential oils, organic aloe vera and xylitol to uplift your oral care routine without any harsh chemicals, dyes or preservatives. Our mouthwash is created in small batches in California, and pasteurized double the average required time to ensure freshness without using artificial ingredients. This process makes it the ONLY double pasteurized mouthwash on the US market. We also stayed away from alcohol, which is a drying agent and known toxin, artificial dyes, which stain teeth, and other common ingredients like formaldehyde, saccharine, and sucralose, which all have many studies and articles written on them as being possibly harmful. Oral Essentials’ Founder and Chief Scientific officer both found these hazardous ingredients to be unnecessary, and so took this much needed step back towards the basics. Dead Sea salt is the most potent salt in the world, with dozens of minerals and the lowest concentration of sodium in any salt, and so it is the key ingredient in all of our formulas. This ancient remedy combined with the freshening power of essential oils, the calming effect of aloe vera, and xylitol, a sugar substitute that may reduce the risk of dental cavities, made Oral Essentials the new gold standard in oral care. We are so confident in our products that we back all of them with a 30 day money back guarantee. Try it today and see for yourself!

Buying silence
Posted on August 16, 2018 by walthe310	
Dictators try to silence their critics. It is their nature. First, they try to buy silence. If that doesn’t work, then they will try blackmail or some other sort of compulsion, such as cancelling a security clearance to make earning a living more difficult. If that doesn’t work, then critics are silenced permanently. Does the CIA still do assassinations?

There is light at the end of the tunnel. It is clear now that Donald Trump will be gone before then. If he takes Mike Pence with him, then Nancy Pelosi will become President of the US. If on the other hand, Pence becomes President, we the people should insist that Hillary Clinton be confirmed as his vice president.

Living Her Best Life: Woman Reads Claudia Rankine’s CITIZEN at Trump Rally
Vanessa Willoughby 11-16-15
In an awe-inspiring, highly relevant, admirably witty display of civil disobedience, a woman went for viral after she was spotted reading Claudia Rankine’s Citizen while sitting front row at a Donald Trump rally. The footage, which was originally posted on Jezebel, shows the unbothered Black woman reading the Poetry pick for the National Book Critics Circle Award. She’s suddenly tapped on the shoulder by a clearly agitated, older white man. His body language indicates that he’s admonishing her for reading while Trump is speaking. The woman rejects his request and resumes reading. The situation seemed almost too picture-perfect to be real. Here was a young Black woman ignoring the words of a detached and delusional mouthpiece for Americans clinging to the institution of white supremacy and classism, a family-money-made real estate mogul turned Republican political hopeful vowing to “make America great again.”
Internet detectives soon identified the woman as 23-year-old Johari Osayi Idusuyi. Idusuyi spoke to Jezebel about the exchange and insisted that it was not a set-up. The Illinois-based college student said, “I’m a young 20-year-old black woman who doesn’t care about this Trump rally, and I’m pretty sure that angered her a lot.” Idusuyi intended to go to the rally with an open mind, maybe gaining better insight into Trump’s platform. Her seating arrangement was simply a result of asking. She said, “I think we were chosen for obvious reasons. We are minorities and there weren’t a lot of minorities there. He also instructed us to sit in the middle, so we kind of already knew what this was.”
Fate or a backfired plan, could there have been a more fitting usage of literature as public protest? Rankine’s work deals with the many manifestations of racism and discrimination. Racism is not just overt instances of hate like a yard of burning crosses or Jim Crow-era signs that enforce legal segregation. In addition to snapshots of childhood Otherness, Rankine writes about what it means to be unapologetically Black in spaces typically claimed by a White majority. Idusuyi said that the rally was tolerable until she witnessed how protestors were treated. At one point, there was only one protester left, as her group of friends had been ejected by security. The entire crowd turned on her and started booing her. Idusuyi, deeply bothered by the mob mentality and Trump’s encouragement, decided “I’m not going to waste my time listening to somebody who I can’t respect anymore.”
Trump’s racially-charged comments have been tracked since the beginning of his aggressive campaign. At Vox, journalist Dara Lind compiled a chronological timeline of questionable Trump comments, starting with the 1973 lawsuit issued by the Department of Justice for housing discrimination. Like many of his Republican peers, Trump has never been an Obama advocate, publicly questioning the validity of the President’s college education, his American citizenship, and his birth certificate. Trump’s bigotry has certainly propelled his current campaign, even influencing his followers to act upon his vilification tactics. In August of this year, two brothers from Boston beat up a homeless Latino man, confirming that they were “inspired in part” by Trump. He may seem as ridiculous as the FOX news reporters appalled by the so-called war on Christmas, but not everyone thinks Trump is a joke. In part three of Citizen, Rankine reflects on racist language and its purpose. She surmises, “Language that feels hurtful is intended to exploit all the ways that you are present. Your alertness, your openness, and your desire to engage actually demand your presence.”
Idusuyi’s decision to read a book instead of listening to Trump is a brilliant counter-defense. She will not be exploited by Trump. Although she may have given him her time, she will not give him her attention or presence. Who could predict that this seemingly small moment could speak to the unspoken nuances of America’s racial and political climate?

Ofwat urges transparency in business retail water market
7th October 2018
Andy Robinson
business, Finance & Markets, meter reading, Ofwat, retail water market, transparency, UK
Ofwat is calling on all water wholesalers to improve transparency around meter reading services in the business retail water market.
The regulator has written to a letter to them and made a series of recommendations to help reinforce trust and confidence in the market following a number of complaints from retailers late last year.
It said action against these recommendations will be monitored and failure to act could result in Ofwat taking further action.
Responses received by Ofwat from all wholesalers and most retailers in the business retail market following its March 2018 questionnaire highlighted three main problem areas:
A lack of competitive intensity in the meter reading services market leading to high charges and low service quality
Allegations of wholesalers associated with a retailer treating their associated retailer and other retailers on different terms
A view that inefficient market design on meter reading leading to suboptimal outcomes
While Ofwat’s analysis has not led it to conclusively identify any competition concerns related to the first two issues at this stage, it is concerned at the lack of transparency around these services.
It believes promoting higher levels of transparency would reassure and help retailers and reduce the risk of any anti-competitive behaviour taking place in the future.
Emma Kelso, Senior Director for Customers and Casework said: “Poor interaction between wholesalers has a knock-on impact on customers and the quality of service they receive. Our recommendations call for the wholesalers to take immediate action to improve meter reading services by making these services more transparent to all market participants and customers.
“We expect to see significant improvement and if necessary, we will use regulatory tools if we believe there has been anti-competitive behaviour.”

Bustos Helps Lead Efforts to Pass Bipartisan Farm Bill
The 2018 Farm Bill Bustos helped craft as a Conferee passed the House and is expected to be signed into law
WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos, who served as a Farm Bill Conferee, voted to pass the 2018 Farm Bill. The final version of the Farm Bill was negotiated by a select group of House and Senate members to reconcile the House and Senate versions of the Farm Bill into bipartisan legislation.
“The Farm Bill is an essential piece of legislation that provides our family farmers with the support they need to continue putting food on the plates of Americans across our nation,” said Congresswoman Bustos. “Although this process was far from perfect, I am glad we were able to pass a long-term bipartisan Farm Bill that provides our growers and producers with the certainty they need during these turbulent times.”
Now that the Farm Bill has been passed by both the House and the Senate, it will move to the President to be signed into law.
Several bills Congresswoman Bustos wrote have been included in the final version of the Farm Bill, including:
The Farmers of Tomorrow Act: If signed into law, this legislation would change regulations to make it easier for young farmers to buy land and put roots down. Specifically, with rising farmland real estate prices, this bill would modernize requirements so that more young farmers can access USDA loans. There’s a specific provision in here to ensure that more veterans have the opportunity to go into farming too. Congresswoman Bustos introduced this bill last December.
The Rural Health Liaison Act: This would create a new rural health liaison at the USDA to improve coordination and funding mechanisms to improve the delivery of healthcare to rural America. The USDA continues to be on the frontlines in the battle against opioid addiction and the Rural Health Liaison would be in position to spread best practices across small town America to address this ongoing challenge. Additionally, the USDA has the ability to finance the construction of hospitals and the implementation of programs for telehealth and health education. The Rural Health Liaison would promote the awareness and availability of these resources, and provide guidance and technical assistance to USDA field offices and staff on how to best serve their communities. The Rural Health Liaison would also coordinate with other government agencies on rural health issues. Congresswoman Bustos introduced this bipartisan legislation in February.
The Addiction Recovery for Rural Communities Act: This bill would help rural Americans better leverage USDA Rural Development programs to combat opioid and heroin use. Specifically, the legislation would set aside 20 percent of the USDA’s Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program grant funding for substance abuse treatment. It would also prioritize USDA Community and Facilities Direct Loan and Grant applications focused on substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery services – which will help incentivize the establishment of new treatment centers. Finally, it will prioritize USDA Rural Health and Safety Education grant funding for applicants seeking to improve education and outreach on opioids and other substance abuse issues. Congresswoman Bustos introduced this legislation in July 2017 with Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly.
The Farm Bill also includes $350 million to help the 23 million rural Americans without service. Bustos helped lead The Broadband Connections for Rural Opportunities Act, which seeks to close the digital divide by awarding loans grant combinations for rural broadband projects.

Abstract
The paper gives results of a project to develop and demonstrate a no-VOC (volatile organic compound)/no-HAP (hazardous air pollutant) wood furniture coating system. Objectives of the project are to develop a new wood coating system that is sufficiently mature from demonstration and to develop a technology transfer plan to get the product into public use. Performance characteristics of this new coating system are excellent in terms of adhesion, drying time, gloss, hardness, mar resistance, level of solvents, and stain resistance.

GM Went Bankrupt Years Ago
June 1, 2009 Administrator 51 Comments
Although the headlines today all proclaim today as the day that General Motors declared bankruptcy, the company has actually been bankrupt for years. Much like a small private company, General Motors has been run for the benefit of the management and employees, not shareholders. Shareholders have not been the actual owners of the company for over a decade, as management and employees have staked claims to the companies future cash flows through pension and medical claims.
In 2005, I published a post about an "imminent" GM bankruptcy. I republish the post, not to congratulate my clairvoyance but rather to point out two key lessons that investors can use to analyze any situation. First, the markets are not "efficient". As late as October 2007, you could have sold short the stock of General Motors at over $40. Even in the past several weeks, when bankruptcy was all but certain after Chrysler's announcement, you could have bought puts on the stock (you couldn't have sold short because there was no more stock to borrow.) This opportunity arose because the market is made up of many investors who are hopeful, uninformed, conflicted, unsophisticated, or just plain lazy. Therefore, securities are often mispriced, not the other way around. It takes time for information to be disseminated and understood by the market. If you can get ahead of the mass of investors in your understanding of a company you already have a huge advantage.
Second, you didn't need any insider information to conclude that General Motors was bankrupt years ago. All you had to do was do some homework and read the footnotes of the financial statements. Understanding the company's pension and medical liabilities made it clear that equity holders had virtually no chance of seeing any of the company's cash flows return to them. Reading footnotes and listening to conference calls is tedious work and even most professional investors don't do it. However, that's how you can get an advantage over most participants in the market.
So with that, I bid adui to some great American classics – the Chevy Malibu, Buick Lucerne, and Pontiac G5 - three stupid cars with all the style, panache and innovation of a washing machine. You won't be missed.
From Contrahour, March 21, 2005 –
(Scene: At Play Now – in the bosses office)
Thomassoulo: George, I’ve realized we’ve signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think it’s best that we both go our separate ways.
George: I don’t understand.
Thomassoulo: We don’t like you. We want you to leave.
George: Clearer
(Scene: At Monks Café)
Jerry: So you’re staying at Play Now?
George: Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
Jerry: But they not you aren’t handicapped, aren’t you ashamed?
George: They’re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
(Scene: At Play Now – in the bosses office)
Thomassoulo: You win George. We’ve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That’s half of your entire contract. Please…just go.
George: You see if I stay th e whole year, I get it all.
Thomassoulo: Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza’s handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.
George: Well played.
Thomassoulo: I’ll see you in hell Costanza.
— Seinfeld Episode 158 "The Voice"
General Motors CEO, Richard Wagoner, probably never watched Seinfeld regularly but if he had, he might have been able to save his company. His strategy of appeasing the union and waiting for employee attrition to reduce the company's payroll has backfired. As it stands, I believe that employees will be able to outlast GM's precarious liquidity position. The company is currently being run to fund current and former employee benefits, not for shareholders or creditors. Therefore, I believe GM will have to file for bankruptcy to restructure the company's crushing pension and healthcare obligations.
With the GM fiasco on the front pages, it's an opportune time to look at how I analyzed this situation. At first glance, GM might seem to be a reasonable speculative bet. The stock is trading at about 1x trailing EBITDA, 2x trailing cash flow, .09x sales, 4.5x trailing earnings and has a 7% yield.
In other words, the company's horrible fundamentals are probably priced into the stock at these levels. Among the well know problems are the company's short-sighted strategy of providing 0% financing and additional incentives for new car buyers. This pulled demand for the company's cars into the present, leaving future demand very low. The company's line up of brands and cars also gives you an insight into the company's problems. Aside from Cadillac and Hummer, none of the company's cars offer a distinctive marketing angle or economic benefit. If you want reliability you buy Japanese, and if you to show off, you buy German, if you want cool, you certainly don't buy a Pontiac. In fact, 4 of the company's 10 brands should probably be killed – Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Opel – because they are so tired and have no cache left.
These problems could be resolved by aggressively managing the company's operations. If the operational issues were all that plagued GM, I would probably be tempted to buy the stock rather than run for the hills.
The real problem is the company's onerous expense and liquidity position which is the result of the financial obligations owed to current and former employees. There are several aspects to this problem.
First, the company is not capable of cutting expenses aggressively because of its union contract. According to the Detroit Free Press, the big three U.S. auto makers and the largest auto-parts supplier are paying about 10,000 hourly workers in the U.S. and Canada full wages and benefits not to work, despite falling U.S. market shares, shuttered plants and production cutbacks. These workers are essentially in a holding tank for hourly employees who are off work a long time, a system devised by the auto makers and the United Auto Workers union.
While most of the companies refused to say how much they are spending to pay these workers, a Free Press survey suggests it is likely well over $1 billion this year, given the number of workers and typical union wage-and-benefit packages. Auto supplier Delphi has told Wall Street that it will spend $300 million in 2005 to pay the salaries and benefits for about 2,300 union workers who currently don't have jobs, and it says that cost is "as high as it has ever been for us." GM's 2004 10-K states that the average hourly wage for its employees is about $74/hour. I'm guessing few employees are actually getting paid that but once you add in the healthcare expense and "excess" workers, it's probably close.
Second, closer examination of the footnotes to the company's pension and other obligations, reveals that the company cannot survive with its current expense structure. The obligations due to current and former employees are a drain on the company's resources.
This table from the company's 2004 10-K from Footnote 16 reveals many of the issues. The colored items represent areas of interest:
Lets first analyze the pension plan, which is actually in reasonable shape. GM has historically had an underfunded pension plan but it is currently overfunded by $1.9 billion in the US. The plan is in good shape because the company funded it with a $10 billion contribution from the largest corporate debt offering ever in 2003. This essentially shifted the risk from employees (who might not get their pension), to creditors (who might not get full value of the bonds if GM goes into bankruptcy).
The foreign pension plan, which the company inherited when GM bought Saab, is in worse shape as it is underfunded by about $9 billion. This could cause a problem since GM will have to fund it from ongoing operations or existing cash on the balance sheet. And the company will probably be unable to raise capital at a reasonable price unless investors become more comfortable with the operations.
A minor side note is the company's assumption on the discount rate used to calculate its pension plan obligations. The company looks like it makes a slightly aggressive but still reasonable assumption that the pension plan will return 9% over the foreseeable future. That's down from 10% in the past year – which was clearly too aggressive. I think a more reasonable assumption would be 8%, and which would make the plan look underfunded again, but I can live with 9%.
The real problem for General Motors comes in the form of the Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits lines. These amounts refer to the retirement benefits provided by a company to its employees other than those from its pension plan – for the most part "healthcare expense". A look at the Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits from the table shows why this is the key issue for GM – the company's future obligations in this segment amount to $77 billion, while the company's plan to fund those obligations only contains $16 billion – leaving the company on the hook for about $61 billion in future healthcare expenses.
CSFB analyst David Zion, who has done an outstanding job analyzing retirement obligations, succinctly explains the problem with the Other Post Retirement Employee Benefits for existing and potential shareholders – "In many cases, in particular among large companies, the risk of rising benefit costs is absorbed directly by the company if the OPEB plan is self-insured. Investors need to take this risk into account when valuing a company with an OPEB plan, as they are not only investing in an operating company, but they may also be purchasing a healthcare insurance company, and, for those with pension plans, an asset manager, all rolled into one."
The Company paid out $3.8 billion in 2004 for expenses related to retiree healthcare. In addition, GM used $5 billion to fund the OPEB plan in the hopes that one day the plan will be fully funded and the company will no longer have to use cash from operations to pay for retiree expenses. I believe the $3.8 billion expense will probably rise at a faster rate as employees continue to retire and grow older. It seems unlikely that GM will be able to get the OPEB plan fully funded at any time in the near future.
The under-funded OPEB plan is essentially a cash flow problem. The $3.8 billion in expense and $5 billion in plan contribution is a high price to pay for a company that will only be breakeven on a "cash from operations" basis according to its own forecast. This is cash flow that could be used to pay down debt or pay a dividend is essentially diverted to paying for retiree healthcare.
There are two ways out of this predicament for GM – 1) fund the obligations with outside capital, as it did in 2003 when it issued $10 billion in debt or 2) renegotiate the extent of its obligations.
Given the state of GM’s balance sheet, I don’t believe the company will be able to float additional debt at reasonable rates to fund its obligations. The company’s balance sheet has deteriorated significantly in the past 15 years as the company has relied more on finance operations to boost the auto division’s results:
That’s right! Debt has tripled while stockholder’s equity has actually gone down over the past 15 years. Again, this is not a company being run for stockhoders – its being run for current and former employees. In addition, GM has $56 billion of debt coming due between now and 2007. It seems unlikely to me that the debt market will allow the company to issue additional debt on top of the existing amounts it already has to roll over. Therefore, it seems that the company could issue equity at these prices but I view that as unlikely given that the stock would collapse even further. I believe the only other choice for GM is to try to renegotiate its obligations.
However, I believe the company will be unable to negotiate with much leverage given that GM is locked into its current union contract until 2007. Therefore, the only way I see for GM to remain a competitive force in the auto industry is to enter into bankruptcy. From bankruptcy the union should feel pressure to come to a more reasonable compromise on healthcare obligations to help the company exit bankruptcy. Otherwise, neither the shareholders nor the employees will have anything – just like Play Now –
(Scene: At Monk’s Café)
Jerry: Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you’re not going in anymore.
George: Yeah.
Jerry: So they’re not paying you your…
George: No.
Jerry: So you’re pretty much…
George: Yeah.

I would like to have some of the stuff I posted on this subject back in 2003. One of the most absurd rallies in a stock in history was when GM issued those bonds, the 30 year series at 9 3/8 or thereabouts when 10 year treasuries were running below 4%. Though they still had a investment grade rating, this was clearly a junk bond price.
Also, 9% is an absurd return to consider on something as conservative as pension funds. This voodoo finance was merely one more tool used by management and Wall Street to loot the operation.
The fraud known as the stock market will go down in history as one of the greatest scams all time. There isn’t a period of time ever that the stock market was a prosperous place to have money going forward with dividends a 3% or less. For example, the SPX closed at 336.77 in August 1987. The dividend at that point bottomed at or near 3%. Today the dividend yield on the SPX could be as low as 2.6%, taking the first quarter and multiplying it by 4 and dividing by the closing price of 921. In any case, 934 would be a compound 4.75% gain for 22 years from the 336.77, giving a 22 year return of 7.75%. But, we have likely lowered the yield, meaning the price is actually higher than it should be. Proje ting from June 2003, when the dividend yield was 1.66% was insane, as the price on the SPX is now lower than it was on 6/30/03. Thus we are now looking at 6 years where the return on the SPX was under 3% compound and most likely inflated by a credit bubble as well.
So we are a long ways from a 9% return, an 8% return or even a 7% return. In any case, I believe both of us would have agreed in 2003 that those buying in basically booked a ride on the Titanic and have spent the past 6 years re-arranging the deck chairs.

Excellent website, I love the pieces you have taken out of Seinfeld and used as examples. In fact my brother has a Seinfeld collection and he has sent me the chapters. It is amazing how after so much money has been dumped into that company, year after year, it never took off. It is money that could have been used in more important things that would have helped more people get out of trouble.

It’s remarkable how prescient your analysis proved to be including how the unthinkable actually happened; that secured creditors’ rights were retroactively abrogated and huge swaths of equity were simply expropriated and summarily handed-over to the UAW VEBA trust to fund what’s become the union’s own retirement benefit Ponzi scheme. What’s more, post bankruptcy GM continued to operate its own exempt employee pension plan until this very day. GM has turned into one of history’s largest land grabs that rewarded the very people who profited from driving it into bankruptcy in the first place.

Bankruptcies are federal in nrtaue. The fact you live in CA is immaterial. You should let your attorney know about the above information and let him make the call. The court isn’t going to care about your new bank account as long as any and all information about money going into it has been given to the court. They WILL care about new forms of assets that you have come into between the initial filing and six months after your discharge date.

Well cashing out your peonsin is never a good idea unless you are able to get it penalty free. If you are unemployed are you able to get unemployment insurance money each week if so keep paying your minimum payments until you can get a job and pay the balances off. If not then cashing out on your peonsin may be an option. Consider this, what is your current age? How long before you plan on retiring? Once you get a job are you going to be able to contribute enough money back to your retirement account to catch up where you left off?

Three Views on Vegetarianism
Meat. Should we reduce how much we eat? Should we cut it out altogether? The number of people who have done just that counts for 2% or 1.2 million people in the UK, with half a million people leading a vegan lifestyle, a number which has increased 360% in a decade[1]. We asked three members of our team what they think about eating meat.
Emily Hogg, Marketing Assistant
I’m being honest when I say, five years ago I wouldn’t have considered becoming a vegan or vegetarian. I wouldn’t have considered it because eating meat was a normal part of life. My friends, mum and sister all ate meat, and I only knew one vegetarian who acted incredibly superior whenever I asked about her dietary choices.
When I started working at Cundall in 2015, I was aware of the impact animals had on the planet, but in a far more distant sense. I knew that cows had the most impact and chickens had the least, that eating vegetarian would be better for the planet but why would I care, bacon tasted great!
In all truth, I’ve never actually liked bacon that much.
From the integration of Meat Free Week at work in Sydney to serving vegetarian food at our events to reading blogs like Amie Shuttleworth’s on her own diet – vegetarianism became something I would consider for myself because other people were doing it and because the food was equally good.
But I didn’t start big, at first it was really simple and easy, integration of vegetarian meals into my diet. My room mates suggested I could get more from my budget by replacing meat with legumes. When I swapped beans for mince in my income-saving batch meal Bolognese, I was a convert, lentils were cheaper, easier and more healthy than meat and pasta.
I started making more vegetarian meals and as I went on, I learned to make more with the vegetables that I did buy, more vegetable soups, salads, vegetables as the centrepiece of a dish and that weren’t just the side of boiled broccoli which, let’s be honest, is boring.
Now I only buy meat once every two weeks or less and all my lunches are vegetarian.
I’m not saying full vegetarianism is for everyone, it’s not really even for me, but when I think about people saying, all the anti-vegetarian things I said five years ago, I wonder if it’s because they really think that or because they’re just repeating all the things they’ve read in an online article.
Matt Hart, Learning & Development Adviser, HR
I have become what I would describe as a ‘reluctant vegetarian’. Full disclosure, I love eating meat. Always have. I really enjoy good steak, or a joint of lamb – these are some of life’s great pleasures. However, I have recently found that I am unable to eat these things.
A long with a lot of people, I believe that we shouldn’t just bury our heads in the sand. If I was going to eat meat, I wanted to know all of the facts. So I spent a bit of time learning about the industry, learning about animal welfare, learning about the impact on the planet, and it had a really profound impact on me. I’d never realised the extent of the damage. For example, I’d never realised the level of deforestation to make way for agriculture.
Initially I thought I would move to just buying local food. I was to become one of those boring people who waxes lyrical about the organic meat they bought. The beef from the cow that lived a better life than most royalty and was handfed grass by a servant farmer whilst being gently massaged before it voluntarily donated a leg or two to the butcher. For a little while this was ok. However, once again I spent some time looking into the facts and realised that most of the benefits of buying local meat were not true. More importantly, this time, I had begun to find the idea of eating the animal particularly off-putting. We’re learning more and more about animals, and it seems that they are way more switched on that we ever realised (did anybody see the clam-bashing fish on Blue Planet?!). Before long, the tasty looking fillet on my plate wasn’t just a steak or a chop, it was a piece of anatomy. It was a working muscle with tendons and fascia. It wasn’t very appetising.
As a keen runner and wannabe triathlete, I did initially worry about the impact of cutting out meat and was concerned that I would not get enough protein to train and race regularly. I needn’t have worried though; it couldn’t be easier to get more than enough protein from all sorts of other sources – milk, eggs, nuts, vegetables, the occasional bit of Quorn. My diet has actually improved significantly. I just wish my race results had too.
So now I don’t eat meat. Do I miss it? Yes, I miss the flavours, but right now I cannot stand the thought of it.
Kevin McGee, Associate, Geotechnical
We all are told that meat has the highest carbon footprint of our food chain, right? And so we follow the notion with meat, as with so many other foodstuffs, that to buy local is the panacea.
Well, for meat, the answer is not that simple. In fact this notion is fantasy.
Our local farmers are hauling meat, sometimes hundreds of miles, to find the nearest approved abattoir or to chase valuable extra revenue. The reality is your Sunday joint may have travelled 200 miles for processing, before returning 200 miles back to the shop fridges, and all so the ‘local’ claim can be substantiated.
I can cite the anecdotes from one farmer in the valleys of North Northumberland who sees his livestock transported more than 150 miles into Yorkshire for processing, only for it to end up back in the local Co-Op a matter of a few miles away down the valley. But at least its local right? And apparently, we are told, that’s a good thing.
Ever increasing food regulation, market competition and improvements to our road infrastructure see our food miles spiral, and our impacts multiply. The winners are becoming harder to see. The losers are you and I, and the environment we share.
The reality is, that the only solution if you want to be truly ‘sustainable’, might just be to look for an alternative…
Nutritionist Note
Rachel Allen, BSc MSc DrPH RNutr (Public Health)
By cutting out meat, fish, eggs and dairy products it is important to remember you are also cutting out sources of essential nutrients. Vegetarians and vegans should ensure they include in their diet non-meat sources of iron (e.g. pulses, green vegetables and fortified foods); B12 (e.g. fortified foods such as yeast extract) and vitamin D (fortified foods or a supplement). In addition vegans should ensure they get enough calcium (e.g. pulses and fortified dairy-alternatives).

BOOK
Nasser’s Peace: Egypt’s Response to the 1967 War with Israel
Gamal Abdel Nasser was arguably one of the most influential Arab leaders in history. As President of Egypt from 1956 to 1970, he could have achieved a peace agreement with Israel, yet he preferred to maintain his unique leadership role by affirming pan-Arab nationalism and championing the liberation of Palestine, a common euphemism for the destruction of Israel.
In that era of Cold War politics, Nasser brilliantly played Moscow, Washington, and the United Nations to maximize his bargaining position and sustain his rule without compromising his core beliefs of Arab unity and solidarity. Surprisingly, little analysis is found regarding Nasser’s public and private perspectives on peace in the weeks and months immediately after the 1967 War. Nasser’s Peace is a close examination of how a developing country can rival world powers and how fluid the definition of “peace” can be.
Drawing on recently declassified primary sources, Michael Sharnoff thoroughly inspects Nasser’s post-war strategy, which he claims was a four-tiered diplomatic and media effort consisting of his public declarations, his private diplomatic consultations, the Egyptian media’s propaganda machine, and Egyptian diplomatic efforts. Sharnoff reveals that Nasser manipulated each tier masterfully, providing the answers they desired to hear, rather than stating the truth: that he wished to maintain control of his dictatorship and of his foothold in the Arab world.

Arab Decline and Iran’s Rising Influence (The World Post, 10 Feb 2016)
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, leader of the largest Arab nation during the 1950s and 1960s, was one of the most popular and charismatic statesmen of the twentieth century. In his 1954 memoir, The Philosophy of the Revolution, Nasser claimed that Egypt’s unique geography and historical legacy enhanced its ability to influence Africa, the Muslim world, and the Arab world. Of these three significant regions, it was the Arab world which captivated Nasser’s attention the most: “I always imagine that in this region in which we live there is a role wandering aimlessly about in search of an actor to play it.” . . .
How the Egyptian Press Views the Yemen War (The World Post, 29 Apr 2015)
Michael Sharnoff explores recent editorials from major Egyptian newspapers that can provide a glimpse of Cairo’s attitudes toward the war in Yemen: On March 25, Saudi Arabia led a pan-Arab military campaign in Yemen known as “Decisive Storm” to expel the Iranian-backed Houthis, who seized control of the country in January after deposing President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. . . .

RST 644, POLITICS & STATECRAFT OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
While threats of the 20th century arose from powerful nation states, the key dimensions of the future – globalization, multi-national violent conflicts, and the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction mean great dangers from the relative weak states and ungoverned areas of Africa. Globalization enhances the awareness of the world to the most basic events, making speed of analysis and decision making more important and the consequences more significant. The objective of this course is to transform how professionals think about Africa and its interactions with the rest of the world.
INT 714, COUNTER INTELLIGENCE
The aim of this course is to show how counterintelligence activity protects US national security by 1) defending against acts of penetration, sabotage, and physical violence undertaken by foreign intelligence agencies and 2) defeating an adversary’s efforts by identifying and manipulating its behavior through deception and/or the exploitation of its agents. The course addresses the relationship between the intelligence and law enforcement communities as well as between civilian and military agencies. It also emphasizes the increasing importance of cyber espionage and economic espionage in an age of globalization.
Through this course, students will
Analyze methods to defend against foreign and domestic espionage;
Elaborate the use of deception to defeat other actor’s intelligence capabilities;
Examine the role of espionage and counterintelligence as means of achieving national goals;
Assess the growing relationship between the intelligence and law enforcement communities and the relationship between civilian and military agencies;
Evaluate the role of counterintelligence in cyber espionage and economic espionage;
Communicate ideas clearly, concisely, and effectively in writing, discussions, and presentations
NSC 732, LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT
The course is a detailed examination of the theory and practice of conflict in circumstances less than general conventional war. Key concepts and strategic principles pertaining to asymmetric warfare, terrorism, insurgency and counterinsurgency, irregular warfare, unconventional warfare, and military operations less than war (peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance) will be examined. This course examines the causes, conduct, patterns, and effects of conflict short of total or general war. It covers the modern insurgency period from Mao Tse Tung’s approach in the Chinese Civil War through our present times with the Global Jihad.
It asks four fundamental questions in the U.S. context:
What is modern war in today’s contemporary operating environment?
What paths has it traveled in the post-World War II era into the early 21st Century?
What are the trends and where is it headed
RST 727, RUSSIAN POLITICS AND STATECRAFT
This survey course on Russian politics and statecraft addresses enduring questions on: patterns of cooperation and confrontation with other great powers, a centrally dominated economy, and a political culture that exploits weak formal political institutions to sustain a very small leadership ground. In addressing these issues, we ask: What are the wars that have defined Russia’s borders? When and why do Russian leaders challenge other states? What does power in Russia look like? Who are the rulers and their supporters? How do they obtain, practice, and lose power?
In reviewing the origins and practices of Russian statecraft, we will assess when Russia as a great power has been (dis-) satisfied with the international distribution of economic and political benefits, and when it has sought to revise or maintain the international order. We will use this knowledge to address current issues in Russia’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic alliance and other world powers, including contentious issues such as money laundering, sanctions regimes, “information wars,” and Russia’s declared and undeclared conflicts.
NSC 601, INTRODUCTION TO NATIONAL SECURITY
This course is divided into four parts. Part I will focus on generally accepted concepts of deception and counter deception with an emphasis on the underlying concepts that enable operational and strategic deceptions. Part II is designed to introduce the student to operational level deception and its impact on national decision making and warning. Part III will build upon parts one and two in order to facilitate the construction of a holistic model for Russian Strategic Deception and Information Confrontation. Part IV will move beyond strategic military and information confrontation and analyze strategic-political deception and provocations and apply previous concepts to a detailed analysis of current events.
INT 746, CYBER INTELLIGENCE
This course examines the vast frontier of Cyberspace and the Internet over which travels ever increasing amounts of information and communications. This new dimension of power has strong positive and negative implications for U.S. national security strategy and policy. For national security, Cyberspace represents a unique challenge, as it has no borders or boundaries unlike previous power dimensions — land, sea, air and space. Past separations between government and the private sector and national security and law enforcement have been blurred. Cyberspace also represents an arena where a non-state actor’s powers can equal or exceed any nation state. And, 20th Century based government institutions often have trouble reacting to its 21st century instantaneous speed, ubiquity and volume.
By the end of the course, the student will be able to:
Address the issues of volume, velocity and veracity of information in cyber space and how they relate to intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination in both the public and private sector;
Evaluate the ability of non-nation state players to effect national and corporate security;
Understand the challenges of devising systems to secure the current internet;
Examine the legal and politic implication of a system without borders
RST 643, THE CONTEMPORARY MIDDLE EAST: A NEW LOOK AT CHANGING REGIONAL DYNAMICS
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the changing regional dynamics of the Middle East. The region serves as the primary source for international energy consumption, yet remains an epicenter of instability, radicalism and terrorism. The 2010 Arab uprisings, Iran’s quest for nuclear capability and the rapid expansion of Islamic State have greatly increased the volatility by threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of regional states. A resurgence of political Islam and growing sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shiites add to the regional disorder. Middle Eastern states too weak to control their territory lack the legitimacy or kinetic ability to exert full control over their borders. In these fragile areas, state and non-state threats thrive and pose tremendous national security challenges and concerns for the region and beyond.
The course will examine the national security challenges facing Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians, and analyze how recent shifting political, social, and economic dynamics impact them. The course will focus on the regional actors’ attitudes of the challenges and threats they face and on the strategies they have chosen to confront them. It thus provides critical perspective to students seeking a more comprehensive understanding of the changing Middle Eastern landscape and foreign policy. The course is designed for students interested in the Middle East, particularly those interested in national security issues, students of comparative politics and future practitioners, with a curiosity in regional studies.
INT 639 – RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
This course examines the vast frontier of Cyberspace and the Internet over which travels ever increasing amounts of information and communications. This new dimension of power has strong positive and negative implications for U.S. national security strategy and policy. For national security, Cyberspace represents a unique challenge, as it has no borders or boundaries unlike previous power dimensions — land, sea, air and space. Past separations between government and the private sector and national security and law enforcement have been blurred. Cyberspace also represents an arena where a non-state actor’s powers can equal or exceed any nation state. And, 20th Century based government institutions often have trouble reacting to its 21st century instantaneous speed, ubiquity and volume.
By the end of the course, the student will be able to:

NSC 730, NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING, STRATEGY AND DECISION MAKING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
Washington’s problem in a nutshell is that it doesn’t think very well. The last quarter century has seen an explosion in the human capacity to create and manipulate new knowledge—yet many of the instruments used to support national security leadership are as creaky as ever. All this needs to change if America wants to outthink it enemies and it help it friends secure a safe, free, and prosperous future. This course provides both an introduction to the theoretical constructs and practical exercises in the three critical pillars of overseeing national security affairs—planning, strategy, and decision-making. Lessons provide a foundation for the skills, knowledge, and attributes to analyze, address, and manage national security affairs at the operational and strategic levels.
MDV 729, RUSSIAN DECEPTION, OPERATIONS, AND INFORMATION CONFRONTATION
Russian Deception Operations and Information Confrontation is designed to lay the historical, thematic and contemporary context that will provide the fundamental perspective and foundational knowledge required to successfully recognize, analyze and initiate counter deception activates. This course is designed for analysts in order to equip them with the necessary knowledge to understand the impact of Russian deception. This in-depth study of Russian deception practices will trace the evolution of the art specific to Russian over the course of the past century starting in 1917 and ending with the implementation of Russia’s Information Confrontation doctrine. The course is designed to address these issues functionally starting with basic military/tactical deceptions and progressing through the use of strategic enablers, provocations and influence operations.
NSC 712, NUCLEAR WEAPONS/MISSILE DEFENSE/WMD POLICY
Overview: An in depth look at three critical Defense areas of Nuclear Weapons, Missile Defense and Countering WMD Policies that have been revised in 2017 and 2018.
Nuclear Weapons: On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). The President made clear that his first priority is to protect the United States, allies, and partners. He also emphasized both the long-term goal of eliminating nuclear weapons and the requirement that the United States have modern, flexible, and resilient nuclear capabilities that are safe and secure until such a time as nuclear weapons can prudently be eliminated from the world.
Missile Defense: The Trump administration is working on an expanded U.S. missile defense policy that would address certain threats from Russia and China, departing from a previous strategy that focused nearly exclusively on rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran. The new policy will still call for bolstered technology against rogue states, with a particular focus on weapons to intercept North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s missiles. But it will also mention the need to consider missile threats from Russia and China, according to people familiar with the review.
Countering WMD: The Department of Defense Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction seeks to ensure that the United States and its allies and partners are neither attacked nor coerced by actors with WMD. It outlines three end states: no new WMD possession, no WMD use, and minimization of WMD effects. The strategy also establishes countering WMD priority objectives for the Department of Defense (DoD), defines an approach for achieving them, and identifies essential activities and tasks. Countering WMD (CWMD) objectives focus on cooperative efforts to shape the security environment and take early action against adversaries. These objectives are to reduce incentives to pursue, possess, and employ WMD; to increase the barriers to WMD acquisition, proliferation, and use; to manage WMD risks emanating from hostile, fragile, or failed states and safe havens; and to deny the effects of current and emerging WMD threats through layered, integrated defenses.
This course provides a critical overview of the Intelligence Cycle – from collection to analysis to presentation. The course assesses intelligence-gathering techniques and approaches for various types of information including HUMINT, SIGINT, etc. It then acquaints students with aspects of Intelligence Analysis; the evaluation of data through the use of subject expertise, critical thinking, and the application of techniques designed to overcome limitations in human cognition. It will examine the analysts’ role in the larger national security arena, state, and local organizations and in the private sector. And it will show the importance of the effective presentation of this information under varying circumstances and leadership desires.

RST 732, EURASIAN SECURITY
Coming Soon
ANNA’S STORY
She particularly enjoyed the way that he illuminated the theory of each topic by providing compelling historical examples together with his own personal experience and insights from his illustrious career in the National Security field.
“During the Bosnian wars, Dr. Meyer was The Deputy Chief of the CIA Taskforce in the Balkans. That’s the level of real-world experience that our professors have. We are taught and mentored in classes of around 7 students by faculty of that caliber. It makes for a phenomenal experience, probably unique to our school, I would venture to say.”
Anna also talks excitedly about Professor James Anibal’s exceptional teaching style where students engage in multiple thought-provoking exercises, including some where they try to build and break deception types, guided by Anibal’s own extensive experience in the field.
“Learning by completing these exercises really cements the theories in our minds. These classes are invaluable to any student interested in the topic and will – without a doubt – make us much better practitioners ourselves.”
Anna also enthuses about the significant potential of the DMGS’ student body, where she has found lifelong friends who share her passion as well as her determination to become a leader in the National Security and Intelligence communities. A testament to her care and pride for her fellow students, Anna takes an active role in DMGS’ Student Government Association, where she has served as Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-President and President.
“I can truly say that I am frequently inspired by the students of DMGS because of their constant drive to do more, achieve more, and learn as much as they can. I, myself, learn something from my fellow students every day.”
Anna is especially appreciative of the external experiences DMGS has made possible for her, including representing the school at the 2017 Women in National Security Conference and competing in the 2017 Atlantic Council Cyber 9/12 Competition. However, perhaps the most memorable opportunity afforded to her by Daniel Morgan was the chance to participate in the Oxford Analytica Global Horizons Conference in Oxford, England, in both 2017 and 2018. It is precisely through such enrichment provided by DMGS that Anna has been able to travel outside the United States for the first time in her life. Wide-eyed, she describes how exploring the campus and halls of the prestigious Christ Church College at Oxford University was a surreal experience for her, as she and her fellow DMGS students were able attend seminars, panels, and plenaries with experts from all over the world. She emphasizes how this experience effectively gave her a chance to expand her knowledge, her worldview, and her overall understanding of the importance of National Security and Intelligence studies at a global level. A lasting memory of this extraordinary opportunity was of the conference black-tie gala at Blenheim Palace, the familial home of Winston Churchill.
“The memory that will forever stand out to me is walking up the Palace stairs in a ball-gown on what was my third day ever in another country. It was truly magical!”
Finally, Anna sums up her experience at the school by crediting DMGS with advancing her career through networking opportunities where she was able to meet career professionals in the National Security and Intelligence communities that she would have never been able to meet otherwise. She is particularly grateful for the faculty who took the time to help her discover her passion so she could determine her career path and who have guided and opened doors for her.
“The school really invests in its students not just through education, but through external experiences as well, and that investment really pays off for us when it comes to establishing our careers. When deciding upon a graduate school, DMGS was my choice without hesitation and I would make the same decision again every time.”
GILBERT’S STORY
He says that his experience at the school has gone well above his already high expectations, going so far as to add that it has completely changed his perspective in multiple areas that he had previously viewed through a more narrow contextual lens. He is currently enrolled in the National Security M.A. program, with a specialization in International Relations.
“This gives me a special perspective and understanding of security across the globe. I increasingly understand the importance of studying security issues with a global backdrop since the impact of the National Security is not isolated. It is intertwined because of the interconnectedness of the modern world.”
To achieve his specific career and learning objectives and work within the confines of his prominent career,, Gilbert is obliged and has been approved to take an accelerated track that would enable him to complete this in only 15 months.
“The deans and professors at Daniel Morgan have been incredibly supportive in working with me to make the adjustments that I need to achieve my career objectives while meeting all the necessary academic milestones. They don’t put up roadblocks. They look for the solutions to the roadblocks.”
Gilbert is also impressed with DMGS’ personalized approach at the instructional level. He notes that the small classes result in everyone having a chance to express themselves and to better engage with the material being covered. He also explains how DMGS’ professors have a fascinating way of leading and guiding the class through their subjects, while deftly merging students’ international perspectives into the discussion.
“At this school, different skills and cultures come together in a very special way that enhances the learning experience for every one of us.”
SHANNON’S STORY
Upon her return to the United States, Shannon completed her undergraduate degree in her areas of true passion and was later accepted to continue her graduate studies at University of Glasgow. However, after one semester there, Shannon came to the realization that the program was not a good fit for her due to its intensely theoretical approach. Having been at the forefront of action rather than deliberation, Shannon found a theoretical program to be too confining for her needs and aspirations. Luckily, one of her professors at the university was Peter Jackson, a renowned editor of multiple major intelligence publications. Immediately understanding the frustrations of a student who had already experienced so much and wanted to do much more, hee advised her,
“If you are looking for something practical, there is a new, specialized school in Washington D.C. and everyone there has a fundamentally practical approach to graduate studies. I think that it would be a perfect fit and would get you where you want to go.”
Having taken his sage advice, Shannon is now at DMGS in her second semester and says that she is loving the experience. She goes on to say that Daniel Morgan has certainly lived up to the practical teaching and experience that she was looking for.
To illustrate her point, Shannon talks about one of the first professors she had at DMGS, a former diplomat who worked on the 911 commission and was, therefore, able to give her and her fellow students an inside perspective on actual events that others merely read as history.
Describing one of the biggest differences she is experiencing at Daniel Morgan compared to what she had encountered in higher education thus far, Shannon points to the exceptionally small class sizes:
“I don’t think other graduate students experience the personalized attention we get at DMGS. Each student gets immediate direction and mentorship; at most graduate schools a student would wait 3 weeks to get a paper back and then would have to make an office appointment 2 weeks after that for in-person guidance . Not here.”
Shannon also enthuses over the extraordinary opportunities that she has been given at DMGS. Thanks to a trip sponsored by the school, where she went on a week-long security summit just outside Prague, she was introduced to the UN NATO program (Youth Atlantic Treaty Association) and is now a UN NATO Ambassador. This means that, once per month, Shannon attends international conferences around the world. Shannon is, not only delighted to be a part of this, but is also very grateful for the way her professors at DMGS are so accommodating and encouraging to her in these endeavors.
Another significant advantage of being a DMGS student is the flexibility of having classes scheduled in the evening. Shannon is particularly appreciative of this since it has allowed her to obtain the best internships as well as to get the best out of her internships:
“I am able to work and come to class in the evenings. Other interns consistently have to leave and come back to work to attend classes during the day. As a result of DMGS’ class schedule I get better training than the other interns and it makes it easier for me to apply for jobs without class times getting in the way.”
Shannon believes that these factors all play into the reason DMGS graduates get such wonderful career positions upon graduation.
“I couldn’t believe some of the places that DMGS students have gone. A number of my fellow students have gotten jobs with the top contractors in National Security and one even just got a job at the White House.”
Shannon points out that this is a testament to how good the education and opportunities are at Daniel Morgan. She points out that top firms want DMGS graduates because they are extremely well-prepared, noting that high profile firms are keen to hire DMGS graduates even before the school has obtained the full accreditation status which is expected next year.
Shannon ends her story with a summary of her enthusiasm about the Daniel Morgan School:
“DMGS has been a perfect fit for me. I can’t even describe how wonderful this place is. Everyone is so kind and so intelligent and so well-connected. There is not a better school especially for anyone who has an interest in National Security. As the school is young, it is like a best kept secret …but it probably won’t be a secret for long.”
TOMASZ’S STORY
Tomasz is now at The Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security where he hopes to get an American perspective on issues related to Russian and global security. As he is obviously already extremely well-versed in this area, Tomasz sought out a program with the utmost authority and credibility to augment his own well-established base in the field. Tomasz found that level of authority when he came across current Daniel Morgan – and former Harvard professor, Yuval Weber’s biography. Seeing Dr. Weber’s well-documented expertise, Tomasz said that he “realized that DMGS was the right place to be.”
Now that he attends Daniel Morgan, he says that he is even more certain of the fact that DMGS was the place where true expertise in the field resided. In addition to the formidable intellect of Dr. Weber, Tomasz has also been struck by the depth of national and international expertise that resides within the DMGS faculty as a whole. In his own area of expertise, he has further been engaged by the extensive knowledge and insights of incoming professor, Dr. Edward Lemon, formerly a professor at Columbia University and now a DMGS-Kennan Institute Fellow. Dr. Lemon is a global authority on Eurasia. Talking enthusiastically about his experience at DMGS, Tomasz notes:
“It gives me a different angle and a truly global perspective in my chosen field which is particularly fascinating. These extremely erudite professors and stimulating courses have really shed light in several areas and have helped to unfasten the complex international geopolitical knot.”
Another reason Tomasz was drawn to The Daniel Morgan Graduate School was the possibility to be in the center of Washington D.C. amidst the hub of prestigious think tanks and media outlets with whom he had hoped to make connections. Tomasz says that his actual experience has greatly exceeded his expectations, as DMGS has given him significant access and entrees to several key organizations through its prestigious partners and events.
“It’s so easy to have extraordinary networking opportunities here at DMGS. Many doors have been opened for me and I have already been connected to many people and organizations that I would not have even dared to imagine.”
MARGALITA’S STORY
“I quit my job and embarked upon my second Master’s degree at DMGS because I realized that program would benefit me a great deal. I would not have left my job if I hadn’t anticipated this and I wasn’t disappointed. It was one of the best decisions that I have ever made as it has now led me to even higher paths.”
Nor was leaving her job an easy decision. Before DMGS, Margalita had been working for the UN and EU. She grew up in Tbilisi during the civil war and learned to count from the traces of the bullet holes against a building wall. Coming face to face with war at such a young age affected her career choices in later life and motivated her into positions where she would help people affected by conflict. Specifically, she worked on projects that supported the Prime Minister’s office in her native country of Georgia. She worked in a new agency commission on a National Action Plan implementing the UN Security Council’s Resolution on Women, Peace and Security. Her assignment was to identify the needs of conflict-affected women and girls. Together with the UN Women’s Mission as well as several government officials and advisors on human rights, Margalita travelled to villages along the Administrative Boundary Lines. Her mission was to identify the needs of these women and girls and to translate their aggregate problems into policy to support Georgia’s Three – year UN Action Plan. Margalita then went on to assist in building the necessary capacity to support the implementation of these policies and solutions under the European Union Project.
Margalita says that what drew her to DMGS and what ultimately drove her to take the significant step of leaving her UN position was the quality of the faculty at the school.
“It’s not the name or the history of a school that matters, it’s the professors.”
She is now very glad that she took the steps that she took in coming to DMGS. One of the professors she enthuses over is David Kanin whom she describes as “one of the most educated professors in the universe” and whose classes she describes “are like paradise.” In fact, Margalita is extremely enthusiastic about all of her professors whom she collectively describes as not just as compelling academicians but as extraordinary individuals.
“Even the five-minute interactions during the class breaks is something that we all look forward to.”
The extent of her satisfaction with the teaching at DMGS has been so great that she insists that the quality benchmark for lectures and discussions is now much higher than previously experienced and that she and her fellow students have consequently become “professor and lecture snobs.”
“We now all see how much others miss out on in traditional classes. We have never experienced and probably will never experience this type and level of teaching again.”
Another important facet of DMGS is the free-thinking aspect that underpins its pedagogic approach as the professors encourage their students to question everything rather than blindly following one school of thought. This is an approach which Margalita describes as “unique in today’s world that is oversaturated by opinion.”
“The minute you create an environment when you shut each other down, the learning ends. DMGS clearly understands this and opens up the learning environment to embrace all ideas.”
This openness to multiple viewpoints also extends to multiple cultures. By opening up its programs to those from other countries who seek to make the world a better and safer place, DMGS creates a dynamic and exciting learning environment. Margalita is also very enthusiastic about this and about the impact it has on the school’s environment.
“It’s a real privilege to be in the class with people from so many different backgrounds. It adds to our discussions in an amazing way.”
Finally, Margalita is also extremely enthusiastic about DMGS’ location and networking opportunities.“Being in D.C., magic happens outside the classroom. We meet the people that we only read about previously. We effectively meet history here.”
KENNETH’S STORY
His artistic talent earned him a place at the Art Institute of Boston, majoring in illustration. However, Kenneth left after a year because he was disappointed with the course content and did not want to waste his time on a course that did not fulfill him or develop his talents and aspirations. After some self-reflection, deliberation and research, he eventually decided to go to CUNY to study business and entrepreneurship to learn how to turn his artistic skills into “a business not a just passion.”
Upon graduation from the CUNY program, he took a break for a year to evaluate his next step. He experimented and explored different areas, starting a number of innovative art ventures and productions. He also took hospitality jobs to help finance his ventures. Yet Kenneth still felt as though he were missing something and, while he was contemplating joining the Peace Corps, his mentor advised him to look at DMGS.
He is well aware that many may not immediately make the connection between the study of Intelligence in conjunction with Business Entrepreneurship or Art.
Consequently, Kenneth goes on to explain that there are many areas in the private sector that require intelligence skills, describing it as an underserved field that is wide open for graduates. As time has progressed, Kenneth’s eyes have increasingly been opened to the niche positioning that a Master’s in Intelligence could bring to him to make him highly marketable in his fields of interest.
“I realized that being adept at intelligence-gathering in Business Arts and Media would be a specialized niche. I wouldn’t have to start my own business but instead would instantly have differentiated value upon graduation.”
To explain this further, Kenneth describes how intelligence is a key factor in making effective market and business decisions since being competitive requires knowing what competitors are doing in the marketplace. Even coming up with the title to a song can be amplified by intelligence gathering techniques as that information strengthens all strategic decision-making.
‘The Fundamentals of Intelligence course really taught me how to gather human intelligence – not just as it applies to spies – but to effectively make “informed decisions” using competitive intelligence. I learned how to craft a market analysis through public information. Knowing where to look and how to search things out it essential in all areas of business.”
Kenneth then turns to the subject of his professors. Like all the other students at DMGS, Kenneth cannot help but comment on how exceptional members of DMGS’ faculty are. In his opinion,, compared to other professors who “speak much but say little,”DMGS’ professors really deliver what he calls “the bottom line of knowledge in their subjects,” adding that there is “no fluff or wordiness” as they simply and clearly present relevant information in a succinct and pertinent form.
“They have years of experience and can therefore distill down what really matters in a real work setting. They then communicate the essence of each topic in a way that sticks with the student. Educators like this are few and far between. It is amazing to be in such small classes with such great professors.”
At DMGS, one can’t help but feel the warmth and camaraderie amongst the students. This is something that Kenneth clearly feels very deeply himself.
“I also admire my fellow students who have all done such amazing things before coming here. They inspire me to up my game and it humbles me to break bread and to study alongside people who have experienced even greater challenges than I and who ensure that I always keep an open mind.”
Pressed for an example of this, Kenneth talks about a couple of his fellow students: one who is a Kurd from Iran and one from Georgia who has lived in the shadow of the Soviet Union.
Before ending the discussion, Kenneth says that he must also stress two other things: DMGS’ speaker series and the school’s founder, Abby Moffat. The events, he says, have been hugely important to the learning environment because they reinforce what students are taught in the classroom and they also provide great networking opportunities, as students have the chance to engage with a number of prominent people in their fields of interest.
In describing Abby Moffat, he recounts how much she adds to the positive culture of DMGS. Kenneth also mentions that Abby has been particularly inspiring and encouraging to him on a personal level and that has made a big difference in his life.
“Abby Moffat brings a nurturing and compassionate entrepreneur spirit to the school. Her strength, kindness and insights drive the organization, just as my grandmothers’ strengths and courage drove the successes within my own family.”
RST 733, COMPARATIVE POLITICS
Comparative politics is the study of political systems around the globe. In this course, we will examine how political institutions, actors, and processes arise, operate and change around the world and how they affect society, culture, and the economy. The course combines theory with in-depth examinations of case studies from particular regions of the world. We will seek to explain why the Arab Spring broke out and why it failed to produce democratic transitions in many Middle Eastern states. We will examine what has caused civil wars to break out in certain parts of Africa but not in others. We will explore why democracy took root in Eastern Europe but not in most states of the former Soviet Union. And we will look at how China’s approach to economic development differs from that of Western powers.
MDV 650, FOUNDATIONS OF MANAGING DISRUPTION AND VIOLENCE
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training to help students gain a better understanding of the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes organizations need to address the potential or active threat of disruptive or violent group behavior. MDV 650 integrates a broad overview of the material included in MDV 700 Integrated Risk Value Concepts and MDV 701 Causal Analytics for the non-MDV major. The Integrated Risk Value© (IRV) methodology provides the practical skills needed to develop and manage successful persuasive communications programs. MDV 650 is a prerequisite for non-MDV majors to take MDV 702 Strategy for Managing Disruption and Violence.
RST 725 – ISLAMIC POLITICS AND TERRORISM
Islamic revivalism is one of the most significant political, social and cultural phenomena of the 21st century, and will remain a potent force in the foreseeable future. Islamist movements are not monolithic, and tactics differ toward gaining power and implementing Islamic law. In recent years some Islamists have participated in politics and gained power through elections such as Hamas in Gaza, Ennahda in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Others have taken up arms to resist violently against the state in Libya, Sinai, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The Islamic Republic of Iran expands its empire through proxies and terrorist militias.
Al-Qaeda and Islamic State do not recognize the notion of the international Westphalian state system, and strive to erase recognized borders in the areas in which they operate to resurrect an Islamic empire called the Caliphate. While hatred of Israel, the West, secularism and liberal democracy persists, the immediate victims of militant Islamist violence are non-conforming Muslims and ethnic-religious minorities.
The course will analyze the ideology and goals of Sunni and Shia Islamist movements. It will assess what motivates these movements and why they are successful, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. The course will explore their attitudes of the crisis of Islam in the contemporary era; the desired form of Islamic governance; the meaning of jihad in the contemporary era; and the compatibility between Islam and democracy. In particular, the course will examine Hamas, Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranian revolutionary regime, the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Islamic State.
RST 727, RUSSIAN POLITICS AND STATECRAFT
This survey course on Russian politics and statecraft addresses enduring questions on: patterns of cooperation and confrontation with other great powers, a centrally dominated economy, and a political culture that exploits weak formal political institutions to sustain a very small leadership ground. In addressing these issues, we ask: What are the wars that have defined Russia’s borders? When and why do Russian leaders challenge other states? What does power in Russia look like? Who are the rulers and their supporters? How do they obtain, practice, and lose power?
In reviewing the origins and practices of Russian statecraft, we will assess when Russia as a great power has been (dis-) satisfied with the international distribution of economic and political benefits, and when it has sought to revise or maintain the international order. We will use this knowledge to address current issues in Russia’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic alliance and other world powers, including contentious issues such as money laundering, sanctions regimes, “information wars,” and Russia’s declared and undeclared conflicts.
RST 732, EURASIAN SECURITY
This course examines the security dynamics of Eurasia through an analysis of the policies of its largest state, Russia. The course examines the drivers of Russia’s pivot to Asia, Russia’s policies towards its Near Abroad, Asia-Pacific, South Asia and the Middle East, and the limitations of Russian influence. Through the course, students will gain a better understanding of the complexities of Russia’s dealings in a range of Asian regions, critically evaluate Russia as a global power. Class discussions and many of the readings will be focused on understanding and analyzing Russia’s contemporary policies with the view to giving students the ability to forecast the likely contours of domestic and foreign policy in the coming years. By the end of the course, students will have gained a more nuanced understanding of Russia, allowing them to critically approach some of the simplistic interpretations of Russian behavior in the media.
NSC 710 – HOMELAND SECURITY

NSC 611 – US-CHINA STRATEGIC RELATIONS
Understanding contemporary Chinese history, starting with the Qing Dynasty, with a focus on post 1979 normalization of Sino-U.S. relations, will permit the students to better understand China’s approach to relations with the U.S. Knowledge of China’s military and political organizations will permit the students to better understand these organs of power and how they attempt to manage the plethora of international and domestic issues confronting China. It will also permit the student to appreciate the complexity of crafting a national strategy for dealing with an expansionist China.
MDV 700 – INTEGRATED RISK VALUE COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training to help students gain a better understanding of the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes organizations need to address the potential or active threat of disruptive or violent group behavior.

Tokyo, Sep 3 (IANS) A Japanese start-up linked to the University of Tsukuba is set to launch small satellites with commemorative titanium plaques carrying love messages into space by the end of 2019, the company said on Monday.
Those interested would be able to engrave messages of their choice on the plaques, which would be 1.8 centimeters long and 0.8 centimeter wide, set to be carried to space aboard the satellites and orbit around the Earth for around two years before being destroyed, Efe reported.
Around 10 centimeters in size, the CubeSat satellites would be able to carry up to 600 pure titanium plaques and would be transported to the International Space Station (ISS) by a rocket of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.
In the ISS, the astronauts stationed there will take photographs of the ultra-small satellite which would be then sent to the couples to prove that their messages have reached space, Warspace CEO Toshihiro Kameda said.
The start-up had planned to offer this service exclusively to the couples getting married at a hotel in Tsukuba, in Ibaraki prefecture, for the price of $270, but in the face of growing demand it decided to expand its offer and set up an online order facility in September.
Although they have not determined the number of people interested in the service yet, couples from Japan, the US and Taiwan have contacted the company.
The mini satellites and the plaques would be destroyed after two years by burning up when they come in contact with Earth's atmosphere, said Kameda, a professor who teaches the mechanics of materials at the University of Tsukuba.
If this service receives a good response, Warspace would expand its business and will send out more commemorative objects into space which would later return to Earth, the head of the project said.

Swarming stars in the galactic core
February 26, 2010
by Nicholas Knisely	
Science	
Astronomers are pretty much convinced that there's a super-massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. (Just writing that sentence reminds me about how quickly opinions can change in science – years ago people doubted the existence of black holes, much less even imagined that they could come in a super massive variety.)
The reason for this belief is not theory. It's experimental data. Check out the AMAZING video of 15 years worth of stellar observations of the galactic core. (Much of the data comes from the new adaptive optical telescopes on Mt. Keck in Hawaii.)
Some of the stars in that video are O and A class main sequence stars – which means they're many time more massive than the Sun. And the galactic core is playing catch with those stars making them orbit with a period of 15 years or less.
There's no way to get that sort of orbital behavior without putting something very very massive at the core. Like something with a mass of millions of suns. And there's no way for something so massive to be able to exist in a normal space. The self-gravity of such an object is so strong that it would immediately collapse on itself and disappear into a singularity. A black hole.
Observational evidence of a black hole. I can't tell you how amazing that is to me.

That is a fascinating video. I am aware that this will reveal my complete lack of knowledge about astronomy, but what makes those stars orbit and shoot out the other side or “bounce off” the black hole area? Why do they not collide into the super-massive gravitational area?
Bill Ghrist says	
March 1, 2010
Matt, the stars are not “bouncing off” the black hole, it just looks that way for some of them because their orbits are very elliptical. All orbits are elliptical but some (like the Earth around the sun) are closer to being circular (a circle is simply a special case of an ellipse). They do not fall into the black hole for the same reason that the Earth does not fall into the sun–their velocity keeps them in an orbit that does not take them close enough to the black hole to reach the “event horizon.” A black hole itself does not have a physical extent, but the “event horizon” is the distance from the black hole at which everything, even light, is captured by the hole’s gravity. Even though the black hole has a mass of several million suns, its event horizon is smaller than the Earth’s orbit around the sun. At the scale of the video picture, that would just be a minuscule dot at the center.

What's special or unique about Vanuatu’s marine environment?	
What's special or unique about Vanuatu’s marine environment?	
Vanuatu’s coasts and oceans are home to a myriad of plants and animals. Complex and varied habitats including coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses together with underwater volcanoes and underwater mountains and valleys create a biodiversity paradise.
Within this amazing seascape, some places are just a bit more special, just a bit more unique than the surrounding seas. They may be highly biodiverse, they may contain threatened or unique species or they may have unique habitats.
To help identify these areas, the Government of Vanuatu, brought together marine experts from all the Provinces. Together they used their expert knowledge to map the areas that are truly special and/or unique.
The Workshop was held at Climate Change Conference room at Ministry of Climate Change Adaptation, Meteorology, GeoHazard, Environment and Energy in Port Vila on the 25rd October 2017.
The Acting Director-General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and External Trade, Ms Roline Tekon, said, “As Vanuatu’s begins to develop a Marine Spatial Plan, under our National Ocean Policy, it is essential that we know where our special and/or unique marine areas are. If we know where they are, we can better look after them”.
“Throughout Vanuatu, there is a lot of knowledge held by experts. By bringing these people together we stand the best chance of mapping Vanuatu’s unique marine biodiversity”.
“Once mapped, we can better plan, manage and protect these special places”, concluded Ms Roline Lesines Tekon “Over 30 experts kindly donated their time, coming from all over Vanuatu to advise the Government about which marine places (inshore and offshore) they know to be special or unique in some way”, said Mr Jesse Benjamin, Director General of Ministry of Climate Change Adaptation, Meteorology, Geo-Hazards, Environment, Energy and Disaster Management.
“The outcome of this workshop will produce the first map identifying Vanuatu’s special, unique marine areas”, he concluded. This workshop was supported by the Government of Vanuatu and the MACBIO project (funded by the IKI program of BMUB, implemented by GIZ with technical support from IUCN and in close collaboration with SPREP).

Lamar Jackson has ups and downs as he takes his first snaps in the NFL

Lamar Jackson said he wanted to show off his growth as a quarterback in the Hall of Fame game. It wasn’t the best venue for that.
Starting the second half, playing with a lot of players who won’t make the Ravens’ regular-season roster, Jackson made some mistakes. He had a couple of nice plays that hinted at his immense talent, too. But mostly he looked too frenetic in the pocket and wasn’t comfortable in the offense in a 17-16 Ravens win over the Chicago Bears on Thursday night.

In other words, Jackson looked like a rookie making his NFL preseason debut.
Lamar Jackson had a few highlights
Jackson didn’t start against the Bears on Thursday. That nod went to Robert Griffin III, another former Heisman Trophy winner. Griffin completed seven of 11 passes for 58 yards, a short touchdown and an interception that went through first-round bust Breshad Perriman’s hands.
Ravens coach John Harbaugh might be teaching Jackson a lesson about earning his spot on the depth chart, but giving Jackson the second half didn’t do him any favors. Almost no starters play in the Hall of Fame game, and by the second half there are very few established NFL players on the field.
Still, Jackson had his moments. His second drive was nice. He got out of the pocket and ran for a first down, making some moves in the open field. On a third-and-10 later in the drive, it looked like he’d run again, but he kept his eyes downfield as he moved out of the pocket and hit Jordan Lasley with a nice pass for a first down. That play showed how tough it will be to defend Jackson because defenses have to make the impossible choice of coming up to stop him from running or limiting his ability to pass on the move. The drive ended with Jackson’s first (unofficial) NFL touchdown, a short timing throw to fellow first-round pick Hayden Hurst.
His third drive didn’t go as well.
Jackson’s third-quarter interception is a teaching moment
On Jackson’s third drive, he took a five-step drop, looked down his receiver and Bears cornerback Doran Grant made an easy break on the pass. Jackson’s throw was too far inside, and Grant picked it off.
Jackson misfired on a couple passes. On a third-and-6 in the fourth quarter, he had a chance to get a first down but threw too high for his intended receiver. Jackson finished completing four of 10 passes for 33 yards. He ran for 28 yards on five attempts before some kneel-downs at the end.
Jackson often looked too quickly to get out of the pocket and run. Some of that was due to the lack of protection in front of him. It’s also not the worst thing because Jackson is one of the most dynamic running quarterbacks in college football history. It’s part of what will stress NFL defenses. But he’ll have to work on being more patient in the pocket. That’ll be easier with better teammates around him.
Jackson still has plenty of opportunities to show off his skills
Jackson’s debut didn’t reveal much, good or bad. He was in a disadvantageous situation and playing his first NFL action. Because it was a prime-time game, the first NFL football we’ve seen since the Super Bowl, and Jackson was the rare known commodity playing in the Hall of Fame game, there will be a lot of in-depth reviews of his performance. There weren’t a lot of positives from it, but some.
Jackson won’t start the regular season at quarterback for the Ravens, because Joe Flacco has that job. But he still has four more preseason games to show us his progress as a quarterback.

Robert Mueller, the Master Of Silence

Robert Mueller, the Master Of Silence
He runs the most disciplined shop in Washington—and speaks through his indictments or not at all. But since Jeff Sessions resigned, he may no longer have that luxury. We talked to the people who know him best to figure out what might come next, and what it all means for Trump.
Somewhere in the mesosphere of Washington, D.C., where the pale marble declines into the concrete prairie, you will find the newish and largish building where special counsel Robert Mueller is silently drilling down into Donald Trump's White House. Try to imagine the shhh of a combination lock turning on a secure filing cabinet in that anonymous building, the ghostly whisper of papers shuffling between manila folders, the steel roll-down gate ascending so Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen can emerge from the mouth of the underground parking garage, their souls now unburdened of incriminating secrets, having disclosed them in the windowless confessional of the special counsel's conference room where, The Washington Post reports, Mueller, a “sphinx-like presence,” does not ask any questions himself, instead sitting in the back and letting his staff work the cooperating witnesses over, like a card player who lets his confederates do the betting.
The fuse on Mueller's investigation has been quietly burning away for more than a year. Soon it will, as the dueling partisans tell it, either explode into another Civil War or fizzle away into nothing at all. In the meantime, we make do with whatever pieces of news slip out. From Mueller, we've seen sober legal filings implicating various members of Trump's team. From Trump, we've been subjected to a series of increasingly anguished tweets. He has claimed that Mueller's investigation is “illegal” and a “Witch Hunt.” Most recently, he forced the resignation of Jeff Sessions and reassigned oversight of the special counsel to a loyalist, Matthew Whitaker, setting up what is likely to be the final stretch of the whole affair.
Rather than punch back, Mueller has maintained his silence. Those who know him are not surprised. Robert Swan Mueller III, now 74 years old, has long been revered by elders of both political parties. He is a throwback to an earlier regime, when, the story goes, Ivy League patricians entered government for the sake of service, not self-enrichment.
“He's the perfect choice,” said Ken Starr, whose memoir, Contempt, looks back on his time investigating Bill Clinton. “I know him from observation to be a person of complete integrity.”
“He is smart, dedicated, patriotic, and self-effacing,” said General James Clapper, the former intelligence chief. “There is no straighter arrow.”
Mueller's differences with Trump are expressed in part by their respective styles: barrel cuffs (Mueller) versus French cuffs (Trump), Brooks versus Brioni, lace-ups versus loafers, button-down collars versus spread collars, muted foulard belt-length ties versus shiny red scotch-taped descenders. One man is aiming for quiet adherence to established norms. The other is trying to stun his prey.
John Miller, who reported to Mueller as an assistant director at the FBI and is now a deputy commissioner of the NYPD, described Mueller's wardrobe as being constructed “so that if you got out of bed at 5:18, knowing that you had to be at work at 6:18 in the morning, and you couldn't turn on the light because you couldn't wake anybody else up, it would never make any difference.” It is a kind of sartorial “no comment,” constructed of blue and gray suits, white shirts, quiet ties.
One day, Miller showed up for work at Robert Mueller's FBI wearing a pink shirt, French cuffs, and a gold watch. Mueller called him out in the morning meeting.
“John, John, John,” he said. “What are you supposed to be?”
“Sir, you told me that we dress like lawyers here.”
“Yes. But not like drug lawyers.”
One can only imagine Mueller's thinking when he introduced into evidence receipts for more than $1 million in clothing purchased by Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign manager. Among his acquisitions were $1,500 shirts, $1,000 ties, and jackets made from the skins of ostriches and pythons. Some of Manafort's finery was procured via funds transmitted overseas from a Cypriot shell corporation to the House of Bijan in Beverly Hills. We don't know what Mueller thought about all that because he speaks to us only in court, through the mouths of his deputies and their legal filings. There are no press conferences, no raging tweets, no reply to the president's whining. The quiet is also part of the uniform.
Story continues
Mueller's silence evokes something that we would all like to believe about the American justice system. He embodies the Boy Scout ideal of the FBI: the absolute fairness of the lawful good, of power without partisanship. Somehow, despite abuses of the law in the agency's recent past, this ideal has persisted. It survived the gross excesses of J. Edgar Hoover and the warping of the Constitution after 9/11, with the FBI rounding up Muslims and working hand in glove with the NSA to conduct domestic surveillance. Mueller went along with some of it, until he didn't. Unlike their CIA counterparts, FBI agents refrained from torturing captives held at Guantánamo. In 2004, Mueller threatened to resign rather than continue the most intrusive forms of domestic surveillance. He did not close the gap between what the FBI is and what we want it to be, but the record shows that he tried.
As our common narrative bifurcates like a serpent's tongue, we cling to the hope that someone is keeping track, that objective truth still resides somewhere, in carbon-copy triplicate, locked in a filing cabinet upstairs. We may decide, in the end, that we do not want to know Robert Mueller; we may even take comfort in the fact that there may not be much of Robert Mueller to know. We need him to remain vague and silent so he can continue to serve as a vessel for our ridiculous hopes—that there is someone in government worth believing in, that the times we are experiencing now will somehow be brought to a reasonable end, and that the story of what happened will be something that we can all agree on.
“Silence is a weapon,” said Ali Soufan, who worked with Mueller on counterterrorism at the FBI after 9/11. “The moment he opens his mouth and says anything about this investigation, it's going to be interpreted politically, as part of the partisan circus. And so silence, by itself, is a statement. He understands the importance of the job that is on his shoulders.”
It should come as no surprise that Mueller wears the clothes of a man with nothing to prove. His father, after all, was a DuPont executive. One of his mother's grandfathers was the self-made president and later chairman of the Lackawanna Railroad. Mueller, who still benefits from multiple family trusts, did what he could to give back. He volunteered to go to Vietnam and returned to the United States a decorated combat veteran.
“Those of us who came back believed we had a responsibility to live a purposeful life, to live a life that does honor to the legacy of those who gave theirs,” said John Kerry, who was Mueller's classmate at St. Paul's, an elite boarding school, and who also fought in Vietnam. The two boys bonded through sports, playing soccer, hockey, and lacrosse together at St. Paul's. “People looked up to Bob,” Kerry told me. “He doesn't brag or boast or showboat. He isn't moved by headlines. He's a Marine. He lives by a code.”
Many of those who praised Mueller did not see themselves as part of the resistance. They sounded principled and impartial when they told me that they did not care whether Mueller sent Trump to the clink or completely exonerated him. Regardless of the outcome, they would have confidence in the resulting report, whether or not it was made public, so long as it was Mueller's signature at the bottom. Their belief in Mueller is not a reflection of any belief in the president's guilt so much as a belief in the Constitution, due process, and the enduring power of institutions. It represents the ideal of a government of laws, not men, an ideal so embattled now that it seems to hang on the good name of one man alone.

In Vietnam, Mueller survived a long hilltop firefight in an area known as Mutter's Ridge, a battle that claimed the lives of 13 Marines. He has never told the story of what happened there; others have had to reconstruct it from the words of his comrades and from citations written up by the Marine Corps when he won the Bronze Star. “The minute the shit hit the fan, he was there,” one of the Marines under his command told Garrett M. Graff, the author of The Threat Matrix: The FBI at War in the Age of Global Terror.
Four months later, Mueller was shot in the thigh during an ambush and received the Purple Heart. After his tour, he considered making a career in the Marines and served as an aide to a general. He found that he did not like the atmosphere away from the front lines, and his wife, Ann, was ambivalent about his making his career in the military. They moved to Charlottesville, and Mueller enrolled in law school at the University of Virginia. He passed the bar and became a rising star within the Department of Justice. His work on the investigation of Pan Am Flight 103 led to the conviction of a Libyan intelligence officer. He assisted with the prosecution of Manuel Noriega and approved a deal in which Sammy “the Bull” Gravano would betray his superior, John Gotti, in exchange for a reduced sentence.
In 1995, Mueller made an unusual career move and became a rank-and-file federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia, working homicides. “That decision speaks volumes about his level of commitment,” said Mary McCord, the former head of the Justice Department's national-security division. “If you manage for too long, you get a bit ivory tower. He can roll up his sleeves and do the ground-level work.”
“People would talk about him coming into work at five in the morning. Everyone who works with him has to adjust their schedule.”
In 2001, George W. Bush appointed him to be the sixth director of the FBI. He took office one week before the September 11 attacks and led the bureau through the tumultuous aftermath. The White House was demanding answers about how the attackers slipped through and was frantic about preventing a second wave, one that never wound up materializing. In multiple hearings, Mueller vigorously defended the bureau from congressmen who wanted to break it up and re-distribute its responsibilities. Internally, he was a hard-charging reformer. He required agents to rotate between bureaus, shook up underperforming managers with an up-or-out policy, and opened 18 new overseas offices. “I credit him for saving the FBI as we know it today,” said Sheriff William D. Gore, who led the bureau's San Diego office during the early aughts.
As a leader, Mueller tolerated the expression of dissenting views and would often reach down into the lower ranks to triangulate what he was hearing. But he had no patience for ignorance, lassitude, or evasion. Lauren C. Anderson, who was then the FBI's Legal Attaché to the U.S. embassy in Paris, told me about a 2003 meeting she had with Mueller and several cabinet members of Tunisia in Tunis, the country's capital. When the Tunisians seemed less than forthcoming about a group of suspected terrorists, Mueller abruptly stood up. “We're done here,” he said. The U.S. ambassador followed. The Tunisians scrambled to hand out the gifts they'd brought to the meeting. “The message was clear,” Anderson told me. “You need to cooperate in full before we'll give you any of our time.”
Among his colleagues, Mueller was known for his diligence, his aloofness from politics, and, perhaps above all, his reserve. John Rizzo, the former CIA general counsel, recalls sitting with Mueller in the agency's cafeteria after a briefing. At lunch, rather than bantering about careers and family, Mueller held himself apart from the group. “He was polite and affable,” Rizzo said. “But he did none of that.” Mueller has spoken about the Marine Corps as a second family, and it is possible that he internalized some of its rules against “fraternization,” the development of personal friendships within a chain of command. “He was not a social guy,” said Philip Mudd, who served under Mueller as deputy director of the bureau's national-security branch. “I wouldn't call him shy—I would call him private. Really private. When we would go to Iraq and Afghanistan, we wouldn't sit around with him at night having beers and cigars and saying ‘Where did you grow up?’ and so on.” Mueller was approachable, polite, and likable, Mudd said, but “he wasn't friends with any of us.”
In one job interview, Mueller is said to have had the candidate stand at attention until he dismissed him. He imposed the same sort of discipline on himself. “People would talk about him coming into work at five in the morning,” said McCord. “Everyone who works with him has to adjust their schedule.” James Comey told Graff something similar: “He drives at such speed that he can burn up people around him.”
Some of Mueller's former colleagues preferred his reticence to Comey's showiness. Even before the controversial press conferences about the Clinton investigation during the run-up to the 2016 election, Comey eagerly sought out the spotlight, weighing in on matters as varied as encryption, the root causes of terrorism, how to be a good listener. Mueller, by contrast, mostly closed himself off from public view. Two commencement speeches, spaced out over several years, recycle the same homiletic calls to adhere to the virtues of patience, service, and humility. “We must all find ways to contribute to something bigger than ourselves,” he told the graduating class of 2013 at William & Mary. “Most importantly, we must never, ever sacrifice our integrity.” Mueller has never said much about his military service beyond remarking “pretty accurate” when watching a war movie while traveling on a plane with his staff, words that come thirdhand, through Graff's reporting. “He won't write a memoir,” Rizzo told me.
As extensively as Mueller has participated in the past 50 years of American history, it may all be remembered as preparation for the terrifying responsibilities of his current job. In May 2017, after Trump fired James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Trump's deputy attorney general, appointed Mueller as special counsel. It would be Mueller's job to pick up Comey's most important ongoing investigation and provide Rosenstein with the definitive, official answer to the question that has been dogging the country and casting a shadow over the legitimacy of its elected leadership: What exactly was going on between Donald Trump and Russia in the months before the 2016 election? In his letter appointing Mueller, Rosenstein granted him a broad hunting license. In addition to the power to indict, subpoena, and haul witnesses before a grand jury, Mueller could probe beyond Russia into “related matters…that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” He could prosecute anyone who sought to thwart him through “perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.”
Rosenstein's letter authorizes Mueller to keep digging at Trump until he either finds the root ball at the center of the president's tangled corruptions or satisfies himself that no such thing exists. It is hard to look at the document and not see Rosenstein trying to compensate for what happened eight days earlier, when he wrote a memo to support Trump's decision to fire Comey. Rosenstein was reportedly embarrassed and angered by the perception that he had been used by the White House to get rid of Comey. At one point he is said to have talked about using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. (Rosenstein has denied this.) His choice of Mueller to be special counsel is an understandably frightening one for Trump, or for anyone. “I wouldn't want him after me, let's put it that way,” Sheriff Gore said.
This is how authority is supposed to behave: You do the right thing, for the right reason, in the right way, and you keep your mouth shut about it. It is clear that Mueller couldn't care less—if he is even aware—about his presence in this Men of the Year issue, or about any other form of publicity, for that matter. “One of the ways he's maintained respect is by doing his job and letting his work speak for itself,” Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me. “When you're taking on the task of investigating the possibility that the president of the United States colluded with a foreign country, the very nature of this investigation is historic. It makes Watergate look small.”
“The walls seem to be closing in on some of the key figures."
Rizzo said he doubts Mueller will even hold a press conference when his investigation is complete. But when his final report is done—and many sources have this on the immediate horizon, now that the midterm elections are past—the special counsel's silence will likely be broken. The question then will be whether the legendary impartiality with which Mueller is believed to have conducted his investigation will float atop the deadly partisan whirlpool of the contemporary news cycle or plummet to the bottom. At that moment, Mueller will no longer be able to please everyone, and the more aggressive partisans may look for ways to tear him down. One can at least take comfort in the idea that Mueller is not worrying too much about these political matters, which are beyond his control and, at least in his view, temporary. “He said to me once, whatever we put out, make sure it's the truth,” Miller said. “No spin, no coloring, no shading. Even if we were going to get beat up, we were a good agency. We did good work. And that bad story was one day in the newspapers.”
The report, no matter what it says, will be thorough. Mueller's team has interviewed dozens of members of Trump's cabinet and senior staff, along with the author of the notorious pee-tape dossier. He has spent hours with Trump's White House counsel, Don McGahn, whose cooperation was reportedly “extensive,” and turned around the loyalties of Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. He has more than one million pages of documents provided by the Trump campaign. He has requested records from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook and subpoenaed one of Trump's largest creditors, Deutsche Bank. “My gut feeling is that where the rubber will meet the road is the financial part of this,” Gore told me. “All these allegations about individuals in Russia and investments going back and forth—when prosecutors put that all together, it's likely to be the final nail in the coffin.”
“The walls seem to be closing in on some of the key figures,” said Senator Warner. “I hope he concludes as soon as he can.”
What should be apparent to anyone following the Russia investigation is that there is, in addition to everything known about Trump already, some X factor, something that is known to members of the intelligence community but has yet to be revealed to the public. John Brennan, the former CIA director, has referred to X repeatedly, tweeting about what might happen when “the full extent” of Trump's wrongdoing “becomes known” and hinting at times that in 2016 he possessed information about contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russians, which he passed on to the FBI. As far as those on the outside can tell, X originated in intelligence gathered by Britain and perhaps some other foreign countries. It has passed from Brennan to Comey to Mueller. Senator Warner, who told me he knows “Mueller a bit but not well,” reportedly joked at a dinner in June that “if you think you've seen wild stuff so far, buckle up.” At the end of Mueller's investigation, the fight will commence in Congress over the size and significance of X and whether to terminate this presidency early or allow it to hobble its way to the finish line. All Mueller can do is unearth the X and bring it to light. He can arm the country with facts for these coming battles. But he cannot fight them for us.

Russian Billionaire's Bank Braces for New Wave of U.S. Sanctions
16 maggio 2018 - 18.02
(Bloomberg) -- There’s a high chance that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration imposes more sanctions on Russia, according to billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov’s Renaissance Capital.
The U.S. Treasury in April penalized individuals and listed companies it sees as close to the Kremlin, including Oleg Deripaska, who, like Prokhorov, made his fortune in metals. The measures roiled the nation’s markets and underscored the worsening tensions between the two nuclear powers.
“It seems like this is not the last wave,” Christophe Charlier, chairman of the Moscow-based investment bank, said in an interview in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. “It’s not changing the politics or the diplomacy of the Russian state and, therefore, some of the things that have led to sanctions may continue and there may be more sanctions.”
Russia’s economy was faltering even before the latest penalties took effect, with gross domestic product expanding a lower-than-forecast 1.3 percent in the first quarter. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among banks predicting that the sanctions could further hinder economic activity and investment.

The ruble has weakened 8.1 percent against the dollar this quarter, the worst performance among major emerging-market currencies after Argentina’s peso, Turkey’s lira, Brazil’s real and Mexico’s peso. The RTS Index of stocks has slumped 5.2 percent, while the government’s ruble bonds are down 8.8 percent in dollar terms, almost double the average for emerging markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Renaissance Capital, which isn’t among the entities sanctioned and operates across emerging markets, saw its trading revenue rise last month thanks to the spike in volatility.
“In the first few days after the sanctions were announced, there was a lot of activity in the Russian market,” Charlier said. “As a broker, we had some incredibly profitable days. Some of the best days we’ve had, probably, in a decade. But that’s not the way you like to make money, not when it the market gets hit by something else. Obviously, that’s not necessarily sustainable. May has been a tougher month.”
Investors would hope that if Trump’s administration decides on more punishments, their impact is not as far-reaching as those in April, he said.
“People we’ve done business with are on that list,” he said of the new sanctions. “Indirectly, it affects us. Discussions with clients in New York and London have become more difficult.”

Police worry about their own safety after killings: ‘It’s a different world’
By Joel Rubin Los Angeles Times
HOUSTON — During his 21 years in law enforcement, Cpl. Wayne Curry hasn’t worried much about the approach of strangers.
The Texas officer, like anyone who wears a badge, said he has had his share of run-ins with those who harbor a dislike of the police. But when people have stepped up to him, he said, it is “more likely they want to buy me dinner.”
Curry is now thinking twice. He spoke as he watched over a crowd of about 1,500 people gathered at an impromptu memorial at a gas station in a Houston suburb, where an on-duty officer from a neighboring department in Harris County near Houston was gunned down Friday in an apparently unprovoked attack while fueling his car.
“This was an ambush, a coward that took advantage,” Curry said.
The killing was the latest in a spate of deadly attacks in which police officers have been the targets. Last week, two Louisiana officers were killed in separate incidents and two officers in Mississippi died in May when they came under fire during a traffic stop. At least 25 police killings in New York, Pennsylvania, San Jose and elsewhere have rattled police already this year.
And although dozens of police officers are slain on duty in any given year, active and retired police officers across the country said the recent bloodshed feels different. As the nation has been roiled by strong currents of distrust and fear of police that surfaced after last year’s killing of Michael Brown by a cop in Ferguson, Mo., an ugly byproduct of the turmoil has been a newfound willingness to do harm to those in uniform, many police officers say.
“The general public has a perception that we may or may not be the good guys,” said Curry, 51, a law enforcement veteran who now works with the Harris County Constable’s Office.
The scrutiny, some say, is coming in many forms. The U.S. Justice Department is overseeing the operations of several major police departments across the country; police are being sued, investigated, arrested and indicted; a routine traffic stop may be recorded by dashboard video, body camera or a nearby cellphone; an officer in full uniform can get shot while filling up his vehicle at a gas station. None of these are new, but their frequency and the ongoing national debate over policing have crystallized into a sense of being under siege on all fronts, officers said.
“Day to day, you’re a little more aware of your surroundings, you’re a little more skeptical of people,” said Rick Perine, a 17-year veteran of the Mesa, Ariz., Police Department.
Perine said he has found himself being “hyper-vigilant” since the killings in December of two New York City police officers, who were ambushed in their patrol car. Their killer had boasted on social media that he planned to kill cops in retaliation for the deaths of Brown and Eric Garner, who died during an arrest by officers in Staten Island, N.Y. Garner’s and Brown’s deaths — coming three weeks apart in 2014 — became part of a growing public outrage toward law enforcement.
“These days, if I don’t know you, I’m going to be extra guarded around you,” Perine said. “It is a different world.”
The brazen nature of the shooting in Texas on Friday night echoed the New York City killings.
Darren Goforth, a 10-year veteran of the Harris County Sheriff’s Department, was in uniform as he pumped gas at a Chevron station outside Houston when a man approached him from behind and shot him several times, officials said. Goforth, 47, died at the scene, leaving behind a wife and two children, ages 12 and 5.
A suspect in the case, Shannon J. Miles, 31, was being held without bail on a charge of capital murder. Goforth was white and Miles is black, but police have discussed no racial motive in the attack.
Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman told reporters that the investigation so far has not uncovered any connection between Goforth and the suspect, and it appeared he was targeted only because he was a law enforcement officer.
Hickman referred to a “dangerous national rhetoric that is out there today,” saying it “has gotten out of control.”
He said Goforth’s killer approached from behind and said nothing before opening fire.
It was, he said, a “coldblooded execution.”
Social media sites, meanwhile, lighted up with posts speculating about a connection between Goforth’s slaying and calls earlier last week for attacks on law enforcement on a Houston-area radio show.
The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit group that tracks police deaths, posted figures showing 83 officers have died while on duty so far this year, 10 more than in the same period last year. But, as is typical, traffic accidents have been the most common cause of police deaths and the 25 officers killed in assaults so far this year is about even with 2014, which had seen a sharp rise from the year before, according to the group’s figures.
Statistics compiled by the FBI show the number of officers “feloniously killed” each year has fluctuated somewhat over the last decade, but it stands at about 50.
Numbers, however, don’t tell the whole story, police said. Whether or not violence toward police is up this year, officers said attacks on law enforcement are playing out in a new atmosphere of amplified animosity, in which cops are routinely vilified — fairly or not — by a public on Twitter, YouTube and other social media sites.
The atmosphere surrounding recent incidents of police violence “is more dangerous,” said Deon Joseph, a Los Angeles police officer who has spent 17 years working on the city’s skid row. Social media now have “the capability of influencing millions with truth and embellished versions of it with the click of a button,” he said, and “more people want to hear the sensationalized version than the truth.”
In Southern California, memories of Christopher Dorner still hang heavily over the LAPD and other departments. In 2013, years after he was fired from the LAPD for lying, Dorner resurfaced bent on exacting revenge for what he saw as his unfair dismissal.
Vowing to target the police he blamed for his downfall, Dorner ended up killing four people, including two officers, before killing himself during a standoff with police.
For police in the region, perhaps as unsettling as Dorner’s willingness to kill were those who took to social media and other outlets to lionize him and applaud his decision to target cops. Stenciled graffiti portraits of Dorner appeared on buildings across Los Angeles in the weeks after the episode with “Dorner Lives” spray-painted below.
Sandra Sheesley, who retired a few years ago after more than 23 years as deputy in the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department, was finishing up a trip to New York City on Sunday. Shaken by the Goforth killing in Texas, she felt compelled to visit the NYPD’s 84th Precinct house in Brooklyn, where the two officers slain in December had been stationed.
“It’s overwhelming for us,” Sheesley said.
Sheesley said she can understand both the anger of people demanding reforms to policing in the country and that of police officers who feel they are under siege. She pointed to the Black Lives Matter social movement that has formed in the wake of the Brown killing and the Blue Lives Matter movement that has arisen in response.
“It’s sad, because we need our police,” Sheesley said. “But there is definitely something that needs to be addressed.”
Meanwhile, police in Houston are being more watchful than ever. The Harris County Sheriff’s Department, where Goforth was employed, has ordered its deputies to work in pairs.
Curry’s department can’t afford that luxury. “We don’t have the manpower,” Curry said. “But we’re saying any time you go to get gas, double up. We don’t want a copycat.”

Sanders’ Wife And Kid Shut Down Their Shady ‘Think Tank’
Written by Maga First News on March 15, 2019
The Sanders Institute will suspend operations in an effort to stave off extreme scrutiny and criticism that the organization may have blurred familial lines with campaign fundraising.
The Institute will no longer accept donations and will cease to operate at least until the end of May “so there could not even be an appearance of impropriety,” presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ wife, Jane Sanders, told The Associated Press.
The mission of the Institute is to “revitalize democracy by actively engaging individuals, organizations and the media in the pursuit of progressive solutions to economic, environmental, racial and social justice issues,” according to its website. Among its fellows are founder Jane Sanders, Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King, and presidential hopeful Democratic Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
Jane Sanders and her son David Driscoll are the co-founders of the Institute. The organization pays Driscoll $100,000 a year for his work at the Institute and Jane Sanders receives no salary.
The move comes after Hillary Clinton faced heavy scrutiny regarding her family’s nonprofit, The Clinton Foundation. Then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders heavily criticized Clinton, suggesting that husband and daughter Bill and Chelsea Clinton’s involvement with the organization may have crossed legal lines. He also accused the organization of providing access to foreign leaders to buy influence into the campaign, The AP reported.
“For a politician who runs on fairness and socialist principles, this looks like the old political games,” said Lawrence R. Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, according to The AP. (RELATED: Bernie Sanders Emerges As Early Frontrunner As Democrats Line Up To Announce For 2020 Race)
As a 501c3 organization, The Sanders Institute is barred from participating “in any campaign activity for or against political candidates.” The Institute is also prohibited from any substantial involvement in influencing legislation.

The Institute has declined to disclose its donors. “We haven’t disclosed names and contribution amounts because we’ve relied mainly on small donor contributions from thousands of people. The bulk of our donations come from donors that contribute less than $100,” Driscoll said, according to The AP.
Federal tax returns reveal the group raised $459,000 in 2017, according to The AP. The Institute raised $730,000 in 2018, Jane Sanders told The AP. She says many of the donations are small and from roughly 10,000 donors.
Bernie Sanders raised over $1 million in the first few hours after announcing his 2020 run for president in mid February.
The Independent Vermont Senator and self-declared socialist has been a frontrunner in the polls.
“It’s sometimes important to play it safe,” founding board member and actor Danny Glover said, according to The AP. He defended the organization but said that criticism is to be expected, especially from the Democratic Party.
“This is a very dangerous moment,” Glover said.

Lessons from the women who are leading the sustainable cities movement

I’ve known for a while now that the real action on sustainability is happening in cities — other than Washington, D.C., that is — but a few months back, it came to my attention that many of the people leading the charge are women, often young ones.
While higher-up positions in city government are still skewed in favor of men, sustainability directors seem to be more evenly split between the genders. Because most sustainability director positions have been created in the last 10 years, there isn’t the same good-ol’-boy hierarchy in place. And due to the fact that the field is so young, so are many of its practitioners. Take, for example, Katherine Gajewski, who was just 29 years old when Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter asked her to head up the city’s sustainability department.
Inspired by the women who are leading the sustainability movement in cities big and small, I created Knope and change, a series named after Leslie Knope, the main character in the popular television show Parks and Recreation. Knope, played by the estimable Amy Poehler, is a mid-level bureaucrat working in her city’s parks department. She loves her city, works tirelessly to improve it, and never lets bureaucracy discourage her.
Over the course of the past five months, I found a lot of Knope-ish energy in the burgeoning field of urban sustainability. Although there are still female sustainability directors out there deserving of a profile, my compatriots and I felt 15 interviews were enough, so with this post, I’m wrapping it up.
I realize how lucky I’ve been to write this series — talking to passionate women from around the country was like taking a carbon-free trip every week to a new city. I wish every young writer could do the same. I wanted to share a bit of what I’ve learned, in case you haven’t read and reflected on every piece. (Of course, you’ve read every piece. Right? Right?)
THE THINGS I LEARNED FROM THEM
1. When you’re building a new field, you need all the help you can get.
“Sustainability” is such a broad term — and the resulting city policies and programs are just as wide. A sustainability director must be versed in local food, energy efficiency, waste management, and public transportation. “You have to be ADHD” to do the job, jokes Oak Park, Ill., Sustainability Manager K.C. Poulos.
Add anemic city budgets and the burden of having a new, sometimes politically controversial, position to the mix, and it’s a lot of pressure. As a result, sustainability directors built up a sharing network, the Urban Sustainability Directors Network. Members compare notes on what is or isn’t working in their cities, share plans, and even use regional networks to approach utilities or test strategies for communicating with their communities.
After all, when it comes to sustainability in municipal government, “We’re all making it up as we go along,” says long-time Minneapolis Sustainability Director Gayle Prest. The resulting camaraderie, energy, and mutual respect is rare to see in municipal government. Several of the interviewees described meeting Prest at a USDN conference in words and tones typically reserved for describing run-ins with rockstars.
2. To get anything done, you have to tailor your approach to your community.
Prest uses the term “Minnesota nice” to describe her approach to introducing new programs and interacting with her community. Minneapolis’ bikeshare is even named “Nice Ride.” Salt Lake’s Vicki Bennett uses Mormonism’s roots as a sustainable, independent community to break through with religious conservatives. Susanne Torriente, of Fort Lauderdale, plans for rising sea levels by pointing out recent flooding, rather than rehashing the climate change debate in polarized Florida. Lauren Riga argues that sustainability can be an important tool to turn abandoned, apocalyptic Gary, Ind., into a lauded example of urban renewal. Lawrence, Kan., Sustainability Director Eileen Horn uses local sports rivalries to convince otherwise-conservative Kansans to try energy efficiency programs.
3. While cities are carrying the torch on sustainability, they can only go so far.
Austin may have a high hip factor and cool new eco-districts, but if Texas continues to dry up, so will the city’s water supply. San Francisco might be bringing down greenhouse gas emissions and shooting for zero waste by 2020, but it won’t matter much if a good chunk of the city is underwater by the end of the century. And even the greenest cities have a long, long way to go. More on that in a minute.
4. Don’t count out people from small towns.
Some of my favorite interviewees were from smaller cities. I’ll never forget Maggie Ullman, of Asheville, N.C., and the groggy chickens. (A resident called to complain that the brighter, LED streetlights in front of her place were keeping her flock up at night. Ullman talked to the woman’s neighbors and turned that streetlight off.) Or K.C. Poulos and her experiments in trying to create a versatile, storm-resistant electricity grid.
While sustainability directors in major cities manage staffs that can number in the hundreds — especially if they are in charge of the waste department — small city departments are tiny. This means that sustainability directors have to be scrappy and buckle down on a handful of issues that are important to them. Plus, they are automatically closer to their communities. Which brings me to my next major lessons.

1. Read the comments.
There’s a rule that many in online journalism espouse: Don’t read the comments. There’s even a Twitter account by that name that offers justifications for never taking a peek below the fold. Due to the openness of the web, comment sections can brim with racism, sexism, and folks who are the reader equivalent of overzealous Yelp reviewers. Trolls abound. But despite all this, I read the comments. Every one.
When you’re a 25-year-old still struggling to hit her journalistic stride, this can be terrifying. It’s the sort of thing that makes you stumble out of bed at 6 a.m. to make sure you haven’t made a fool of Grist’s good name — and your parents and your editors as well.
But I’m glad I did. While I wouldn’t say it’s gotten easier, it has shown me the value of an engaged community.
2. There’s always more to learn.
Take long-time commenter Swells22. Swells (I can call you Swells, right?) commented on many of my pieces. His comments often opened my eyes to an aspect of the city I hadn’t even thought of. After reading my article on Norfolk, Va., and its attempts to fight back sea-level rise, he pointed out that the city is built on marshes and so “no matter how much greenhouse gases are stopped, Norfolk will continue to slip into the mud.”
Many of you weighed in on missing pieces of my coverage. For example, Burlington, Vt.’s sustainability director pointed out the issues that stem from trying to plan public transportation in light of low-vacancy rates and sprawl. Commenter ltf wrote:
One thing I always found disturbing about Vermont, and much of New England, was how using aggressive zoning and permitting processes, all the prime areas with decent economic opportunities were reserved for the affluent and the “riff raff” were relegated to the boondocks with long commutes. The social and environmental costs of these practices offset a lot of their liberalism. Burlington does not ‘struggle’ with a low vacancy rate, they deliberately enacted policies which created it.
3. Even the greenest cities have a long, long way to go.
My praise of Portland, Ore.’s green efforts brought out some locals with stronger expectations for their city. From Nagurski:
If we all dressed in repurposed burlap coffee bags and stood outside our houses to pass groceries and other stuff to our neighbors bucket-brigade style instead of all of this wasteful traveling, we’d have hardly any impact on the planet! I get pretty sick of hearing how cool we are while we cut bus routes and build streetcar lines costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but travel at walking speed.
And hmnpwr:
This is truly a tallest midget contest. Perhaps we should call PDX the least unsustainable U.S. city. … Because of the abundant hydroelectric resources in the Pacific Northwest, the single largest contributor to climate change in this region is personal automobile use. If PDX can’t do any better than the rest of the nation does, then it should be ashamed. Some leader.
Snarkist sums it up succinctly:
Its not that we are so great, we just suck a little less than everyone else.
GOING FORWARD
In doing these interviews, I sometimes ended up feeling a bit too much like a self-aware version of Parks and Recreation‘s Perd Hapley:
But as Leslie Knope shows us, doing your job well means knowing your community. It means listening to feedback and not letting yourself make excuses.
Knope describes feedback in heated open meetings as “People caring loudly at me.” And it’s true: You learn from your community, even when it stings. That goes for the women who are leading the movement toward more sustainable cities — and those of us who write about them as well.

Overview
Scientists led by Dr Glen Boyle, from the QIMR Berghofer medical research institute have been surprised by the rapid cancer-fighting properties of a berry found only in Far North Queensland.
The New South Wales Health department found there would be an increase of 500,000 people visiting the state’s emergency departments if a $6 GP copayment was enforced.
AS Aussie teens get back to school for this year’s final term, for some the most important in their education, it is clear this generation is different. Some kids are clean-cut, others scruffy, the variety of the student outfit an eternal hallmark of Australian schooling. But, as we approach 2015, most teens now accessorise with a mobile device, using social media to converse with their peers and the world, round the clock.

Scientists have been surprised by the rapid cancer-fighting properties of a berry found only in Far North Queensland.
An eight-year study led by Dr Glen Boyle, from the QIMR Berghofer medical research institute in Brisbane, found a compound in the berry could kill head and neck tumours as well as melanomas.
An experimental drug derived from the berry, EBC-46, has so far been used on 300 animals, including cats, dogs and horses.
Dr Boyle said in 75 per cent of cases, the tumour disappeared and had not come back.
…
There were no side effects, but what amazed scientists most was how fast it worked: the drug took effect within five minutes and tumours disappeared within days.
…
Dr Boyle said the findings of the pre-clinical trials suggested the drug could be effective in human patients.
…
Biotechnology company QBiotics has obtained ethical approval to begin human trials.

Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton says figures about the number of people who will attend hospital emergency departments if a GP copayment is introduced have been “cooked up”.
The New South Wales Health department found there would be an increase of 500,000 people visiting the state’s emergency departments if a $6 GP copayment was enforced.
A spokeswoman for New South Wales Health Minister Jillian Skinner said the modelling was conducted before the Federal Government put forward its proposal for a $7 copayment.
Mr Dutton said the report was not credible.
…
The Federal Opposition has seized on the report, with Labor’s assistant health spokeswoman Jan McLucas saying it has wider implications.
…
Ms Skinner said the Opposition was running a scare campaign on the issue.
…
Mr Dutton said the Government was determined to make Medicare sustainable.
…
He said Australia had an ageing population and needed to tackle rising costs.
…
The Federal Parliament is yet to pass legislation enacting the $7 co-payment for GP visits.

AS Aussie teens get back to school for this year’s final term, for some the most important in their education, it is clear this generation is different.
…most teens now accessorise with a mobile device, using social media to converse with their peers and the world, round the clock.
Schoolyard interactions crucial to our development — and especially for building resilience — now continue long after kids have left the gate. Some will enjoy an artificial, extroverted rush 24 hours a day, while others, regrettably, will be ostracised or bullied relentlessly, in a community that is all too often alien to their parents. Home time, and sleep, no longer offer relief for the developing brain.
There is, as there has always been, peer pressure to fit in — in terms of personal style, body image, attitude and beliefs. Yet, unlike for previous generations, that pressure — internal and external — comes from a much wider range of sources, all online and interactive.
…
…factor in alcohol, drugs, sex and mental illness, and you can see how life for generation Y can get turbulent. With this week marking Mental Health Week, much attention is being focused on how to ensure this generation becomes a happy and productive one.
Almost half of all Australians will experience mental illness at some point in their lives; one in five are affected now or have been in the past 12 months. The latest available youth-specific data shows 14 per cent of children and adolescents aged four to 17 had a clinically significant mental health problem. But that was in 1998. New data coming next year will focus on the smartphone generation, and combine with recent data on drug and alcohol use to provide a complete picture of today’s youth.
…
In a positive sign, the National Drug Strategy Household Survey last year found fewer teenagers drinking alcohol, including binge-drinking, while the proportion abstaining altogether rose from 64 per cent to 72 per cent between 2010 and last year.
…
Tragically, suicide is still the biggest killer of Australian youth: in 2012 it caused one-third of all deaths among females aged 15 to 19, and more than a quarter of all deaths among men aged 20 to 34.
While the end of the year is an important time for the nation’s students, it is also a crucial time for commonwealth policymakers, with the Abbott government to consider a much anticipated review of mental health services by the National Mental Health Commission (which provided a confidential interim report in June) and a separate review of alcohol and drug treatment services.

Deep roots and open arms make Bulimba a church for all
Posted by: Dianne Jensen in Local Church News 20/02/2019	6 Views
Multigenerational ministry at Bulimba Uniting Church is ensuring a healthy and engaged congregation at one of Brisbane’s oldest churches. Dianne Jensen reports.
The beautiful white timber Uniting Church at the roundabout leading to Bulimba village is an easy Brisbane landmark to spot.
This venerable church, which has served the community since 1866, is home to a small but thriving congregation committed to multigenerational ministry. And as minister Rev Beatriz Skippen points out, “multigeneration” in Bulimba means generations of families as well as a mix of different ages.
“That’s part of the culture of the Bulimba community—they go to local schools, they support each other, they know each other,” she says. “There’s a wide age range of participation in worship and church activities. You will see parents and children playing instruments or leading worship.”
Beatriz is passionate about supporting churches to build sustainable multigenerational congregations where leadership, stewardship and worship are shared.
“It’s an opportunity to focus in the present in order to have a future. One of the characteristics of Bulimba is to create opportunities for children and adults to flourish, to take risks, to learn together. It’s about discerning God’s voice and listening to his whisper, regardless of age or worship style.”
In this historic suburb family roots go deep, such as church council member Gary Lynch who attends with wife Janelle and sons Andrew and Benjamin.
“Our family is currently the sixth generation to attend this church, descending from the Blyth and Thomas families,” he says. “For me it’s important to have multigenerational ministry and there are some families with three generations attending. It adds to the diversity of the congregation.”
For the Lynch family the link is more than just historical.
“We attend this church as it is an integral part of the community and even though some of the community do not attend the church they still refer to Bulimba Uniting Church as ‘our church’. Although a small church, everybody knows each other and is always there to assist each other.”
University student Alexa Harding has been attending the church with her family for as long as she can remember. She plays violin at worship and is one of two young women who are church council members.
“When you come to Bulimba, you can immediately see the diversity of ages and cultures in the congregation. There are lots of families with young children, but also many people who have been attending for decades,” says Alexa.
“I have been on the church council since the beginning of 2018. To me, this was a great opportunity to give back to the church community which has been so supportive of me over the years.”
One of the youngest church members is five-year-old London Lakidis, who plays his ukulele in the band—among other activities.
“I love playing in the band and going to Kids’ Church,” says London. “I like seeing my friends and I love to help out in church collecting the offering.”
His mother Caitlin describes Bulimba as “truly a family church”, where generations are connected and enjoy worshipping together.
“The children are included in all aspects of church life and are always made to feel special by Rev Bea and the congregation. This has led our children to develop a real sense of belonging at Bulimba, which I believe is instrumental in keeping them connected to God as they grow.”

Life as a Substitute Teacher (part one)

Life as a Substitute Teacher (part one)
For several years in my working career I was employed as a substitute teacher. Presently I find myself back in the profession for yet another round of substitute teaching. The last time I subbed was about ten years ago. I wasn’t able to start subbing until January of this year as I had to wait a couple of months to get my necessary documents processed. So far I have only been called four times. The first day out was hard on the system. It was a decent gig but I felt very stressed as I had been out of the business for so long. When I came home I had a flare up of my fibromyalgia symptoms with the accompanying muscle pain. All the same it was a moral victory for me as I had survived my first assignment of the year. Three more calls followed this one and I was feeling more relaxed.
The life of a substitute teacher is a strange one. It is a lifestyle characterized by uncertainty. I get up around 5:30 AM each morning in the hope that I will get a call from the sub clerk. If you have been away from the business for an extended period of time like I have it can be really difficult to establish yourself, Even substitute teachers who have been in the game a long time are not guaranteed an assignment every day. One must get up in the morning and take their chances.

What’s Up?
Last week I was having problems uploading my You Tube videos to Blogster so today I thought I might go back to the written format. On my last vblog I talked about my struggles with arthritis and fibromyalgia. Theses are two nasty medical conditions that cause a lot of pain and fatigue for those that have them. If you too have one or both conditions you know what I mean. Every day you need a new strategy to learn how to live a productive and happy life in spite of theses disabilities. When you grow older these diseases seem to take more of a toll on you. Each day one must wake up with renewed resolve to outsmart theses handicaps. There are days though where I simply have to restrict my activities and get a lot of rest. This is par for the course. The problem is that when I have a day where I wake up feeling fairly good I tend to over do it. This usually means that during the next day or two I will pay for my overexertion.

State Department Breaks ‘Silence’ With First Briefing 38 Days into 2019
State Department Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino speaks as the State Department broke its silence on Thursday, holding its first public press briefing of 2019. (Credit: CNN)
The State Department broke its silence on Thursday, holding its first public press briefing of 2019.
The number of briefings at the agency have plummeted since the Trump administration came into office, plunging from what was a near-daily occurrence in past administrations to a sporadically scheduled event that regular watchers say offers a truncated and less substantive version of past practice.
The State Department gave a mere 61 briefings in all of 2018 — compared with more than triple that in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration– with 219 briefings.
Deputy Spokesperson Robert Palladino on Thursday attempted to explain the lack of these public question-and-answer sessions by citing the recent government shutdown. But that doesn’t explain why the number of briefings throughout last year remained very low, with, for example, only four briefings in April, five in May and three in June.
Palladino responded defended the approach in answer to a question from CNN on Thursday.
“Since Secretary Pompeo assumed leadership last April, he really has taken a lot of steps to increase media engagement here at the State Department, across the United States frankly, and around the world,” he said. “We remain committed to doing all that we can to provide transparency for the American people and to explain our foreign policy around the world … we always want more.”
He cited the number of interviews and smaller scale information sessions Pompeo and his department have given, though that was standard practice under previous administrations in addition to almost daily briefings for the entire State press corps.
John Kirby, a CNN analyst who served as State Department spokesperson from 2015 to 2017, said of the changes, “This breaks my heart. The briefing was literally the best part of my day, no matter how contentious it got at times. I looked forward to it. I believed it was important and meaningful, even if I couldn’t really provide as much context as journalists desired. And even if the policies were difficult to defend. We embraced the chance to explain ourselves. This just smacks of fear and irresolution and contempt, not just for the hard-working bullpen, but of the responsibility of the administration to hold itself to account.”
State Department Correspondents’ Association President Lesley Wroughton said “the facts speak for themselves” on the diminishing briefings.
“There are fewer daily press briefings, which is a disservice to both the press and the public,” said Wroughton, a foreign policy correspondent for Reuters.
“The daily briefing cannot be replaced by tweets. It’s a venue for reporters covering foreign policy issues, whether it’s Syria, Iran, or North Korea, to ask questions about US decisions affecting lives at home and abroad,” she added.
The silence, at an agency whose core mission is about outreach, diplomacy and talking, has been particularly striking given the range of foreign policy challenges facing the US.
Washington is confronting Iran, sparring with China over trade, negotiating with an unpredictable North Korea, pushing the ouster of Venezuela’s leader, sparring with Germany and other European allies over issues ranging from extradition to Iran and climate change and engaging in a face-off with Moscow over nuclear arms treaties.
Ambassador Nicholas Burns, who was undersecretary of state for political affairs during the George W. Bush administration as well as spokesperson prior, said via tweet, “In most Administrations, the State Department Spokesperson conducted a press briefing every day of the week. That was my practice in the Clinton Administration when I held that position. We saw it as the best way to get our message out to the public and foreign governments.”
President Donald Trump’s decision to nominate State spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the next ambassador to the UN could be a factor in the muting of the department.
Nauert hasn’t been seen at the podium since November. State Department sources have told CNN she is preparing for a confirmation hearing, though she still has yet to be formally nominated.
Thursday’s briefing, conducted by Palladino, comes six weeks into the year and puts the agency behind even last year’s sparse 61-briefing schedule.
There’s been a similar dearth of briefings at the White House, where sightings of spokeswoman Sarah Sanders at the podium have become increasingly rare. Sanders briefed reporters once in September, twice in October, once in November, once in December — for only 15 minutes — and twice in January.
Like briefings at the White House, the State Department interactions with the press were generally a daily occurrence under previous administrations and were seen as serving more than one purpose. They provide an opportunity for an administration to answer questions about its foreign and domestic policy from US and overseas press.
But the appearance of the spokesperson — livestreamed on the State Department website for maximum access — also gives an administration a platform to send a message to the world about US priorities and concerns through statements, the release of reports or special announcements.
In the past, State Department spokespeople have used the first few minutes of a briefing to flag issues that are of concern or cause for optimism, including human rights, press freedom, elections around the world that are seen to have gone badly or well.

Trump looms large in Sanford primary
Who's the top Trumper in the 1st District?

President Donald Trump is a constant presence in Republican primary contests across the nation. South Carolina's June 12 Republican primary in the state's 1st Congressional District is no exception, with S.C. Rep. Katie Arrington and U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford trading jabs about their support for the president.
Arrington has been especially vocal about incumbent Sanford's supposed lack of support for their party's standard bearer. Running on a "drain-the-swamp" platform, Arrington has made supporting the Trump agenda a key part of her campaign.
In one campaign ad, Arrington referred to her opponent as "#NeverTrumper Mark Sanford," and, in the recent Charleston County GOP Debate aboard the USS Yorktown, she said Sanford "spent the better part of two years bashing our captain, President Trump, on CNN."
Sanford, meanwhile, has focused on his record as the 1st District's representative, often citing specific legislative accomplishments from the current Congress. Sanford touts his support from limited-government organizations like FreedomWorks while also hitting Arrington for voting on a costly fix for the state's pension system.
Is it fair to characterize Mark Sanford as a #NeverTrump Republican?
In order to answer this question in as neutral a manner as possible, we examined Sanford's support for Trump during the 2016 campaign and Sanford's 2017 voting record in Congress.
Like many Republican lawmakers, Sanford was a late supporter of Trump's candidacy. Initially, Sanford supported Ted Cruz, called Trump's behavior "frightening," and said he couldn't endorse Trump if he were the party's nominee. However, in a subsequent New York Times op-ed, Sanford said he would support Trump in an effort to advance a conservative agenda with the specific goal of adding a conservative justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.
A mixed record also emerges when looking at Sanford's 2017 voting record. According to Congressional Quarterly's "Presidential Support Score," which tracks how often a member votes with the president, Sanford cast his ballot with Trump 89 percent of the time in 2017.
On the one hand, 89 percent agreement is not what most would call an "opponent," and is high by historical standards. However, in 2017, the average Republican support score was 95 percent. So while Sanford is not the weakest supporter of the president—that distinction belongs to Walter Jones of North Carolina's 3rd district—he has supported Trump less than most Republicans.
Who are Trump's strongest supporters in Congress?
Recent papers by Ragusa, Dr. Karyn Amira, and two College of Charleston undergraduates, Lauren Johnson and Deon McCray, seek to explain what drives #NeverTrump Republicans. Two findings are especially relevant to the dispute between Arrington and Sanford on their agreement with Trump.
First, conservative lawmakers were found to be more likely to support Donald Trump in both the 2016 campaign and in their 2017 voting records. As a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, we might expect Sanford to be a loyal ally of the president. Yet the second finding is that anti-establishment Republicans represent some of Trump's strongest opponents. Notably, Sanford has one of the most anti-establishment voting records in the House, a fact that can be expected to lower his Trump support.
All in all, we are not surprised by Sanford's mixed level of agreement with Trump given the countervailing effects of his strong conservative convictions and anti-establishment record.
With anti-establishment candidates supporting Trump at lower rates, Arrington is in an interesting position. She has branded herself as a political "outsider," yet the record is clear: outsiders typically oppose Trump while establishment Republicans represent his strongest supporters. Although this is counterintuitive, it is consistent with the factional nature of the modern GOP.
Another challenge for Arrington is the fact that she was not initially the strongest Trump supporter, either. In the GOP primary in 2016, she admitted she voted for Florida Senator Marco Rubio, not Trump.
Results from June 12 will tell us a lot about the president's support among Republican primary voters in South Carolina. Of course in the general election, with a surge of Democrats heading to the polls, Trump could be more of a liability, particularly if Trump's approval rating remains low. Nonetheless, in both elections, Trump looms large in the SC-1 contest.

Assisted-living philosophy
While the definition of assisted living varies widely across states, there are several core terms that appear in state definitions. Assisted living is generally viewed as home-like and offers residential units and the availability of supportive and health-related services available to meet scheduled and unscheduled needs, twenty-four hours a day. Assisted living is viewed as the consumer's home, and as such includes the amenities that people generally expect in a residence, including a door that locks, a private bathroom, temperature control, a food preparation area, and the freedom to make choices about the types of services that are available. In addition, twenty-eight states have included a philosophy of assisted living (up from twenty-two states in 1998 and fifteen in 1996). These statements describe assisted living as a model that promotes the independence, dignity, privacy, decision-making, and autonomy of residents, and supports aging in place.
Regulations specifically governing assisted living have grown rapidly. By 2000, twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had a licensing category or statute using the term assisted living, and four other states were in the process of developing such regulations. By contrast, only twenty-two states had such regulations in 1998. However, assisted-living facilities are regulated in the other states under rules that may use other terms, such as residential care facilities or personal care homes.
In 2000, states reported a total of 32,886 licensed facilities with 795,391 units or beds, a 30 percent increase over 1998. However, information was not reported by all states. Assisted living has developed primarily as a private pay market. However, by mid-2000, thirty-eight states covered services in residential settings—under either assisted-living or board-and-care licensing categories—through Medicaid, and coverage was being planned in three other states plus the District of Columbia. While the number of states covering services in residential settings has grown, the number of beneficiaries served remains limited with about 60,000 people served, a 50 percent increase in two years. Over 36 percent of the units (or beds) are located in three states: California (136,719), Florida (77,292), and Pennsylvania (73,075). Since 1998, the number of licensed facilities has soared in Delaware (by 214 percent), Iowa (144 percent), New Jersey (139 percent), and Wisconsin (119 percent). Ten states reported growth in licensed facilities of between 40 percent and 100 percent in the past two years: Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Indiana, Massachusetts, J.

Marriott International, best-known for its hotels, has built or purchased more than 100 assisted living facilities, which it views as an expanding market. (AP photo by Mike Derer.) Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, South Dakota, and Texas.
Within the industry and among state officials, there is often a debate about where assisted living lies on a social-medical continuum. Hawes et al. found that some operators view assisted living as a nonmedical model (without RN staffing) that provides high privacy and low service. Others view it as a high-privacy/high-service model that offers a wide range of services, aging in place, and private units. Over half of all the facilities were considered low-privacy/low-service models that offered shared units and limited health services. The study also pointed out that many in the industry question whether privacy and service level were accurate variables to use in describing assisted living. The report concludes that there is no agreement at the operational level on what constitutes assisted living.
The Hawes report also examined whether facilities support aging in place, the ability to receive additional services as needs change. Fifty-four percent would not retain residents needing transfer assistance, 68 percent would not serve residents needing nursing care, and 55 percent would not retain people with severe cognitive impairment. Twenty-four percent of assisted-living residents received help with three or more activities of daily living (ADLs), compared to 84 percent of nursing-home residents. The authors note that these findings suggest that assisted living may not serve as a substitute for nursing-home care. However, in the absence of assisted living, it is likely that many residents with fewer ADL impairments would seek nursing home placement. The differences in impairment levels between residents of assisted-living facilities and nursing homes may in fact be due to the availability of assisted-living facilities to serve residents with relatively low needs.
Findings from Hawes et al. contrast with those from Mollica which indicate that 87 percent of state licensing agencies feel that assistedliving facilities are providing as high a level of care as allowed by regulation. Anecdotally, licensing-agency staff indicate that some facilities may be serving people longer than they should (based on their staff capacity and training), even though the level of need is consistent with what is allowed by regulation.
The 1999 U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) study of assisted living in four states (California, Florida, Ohio, and Oregon) concluded that these facilities support aging in place. Seventy-five percent of facilities included in the report said that they admitted residents who have mild to moderate memory or judgment problems, are incontinent but can manage on their own or with some help, have a short-term need for nursing care, or need oxygen supplementation. However, this level of care may be limited since it implies that people with severe memory loss who need more than occasional assistance with incontinence or who need nursing services for longer periods would not be served.

Architectural Engineering: Benefits and Recommendations of Building Retrofits
Many large cities have an ambitious emissions reduction target, meaning that existing buildings will require significant upgrades in their architectural engineering to reduce their environmental footprint. New constructions normally achieve superior energy performance compared with retrofitted buildings but demolishing and rebuilding an existing property is extremely expensive and unfeasible in most cases.
A building retrofit that is well planned and executed can cut down building energy consumption by around 50%, while emissions decrease by 65%. A new construction achieves an extra 5-10% of energy efficiency, but this is a small gain compared with the cost of rebuilding it from zero, not to mention the environmental impact of demolishing the old building. Several decades may pass before the marginal performance gains of a new construction make up for the environmental and financial impact.
Like with any architectural engineering project, an unplanned approach is unlikely to yield good results in a building retrofit. The first step is to assess the condition of your property and identify key areas of opportunity. These can then be analyzed individually in terms of technical and financial viability, creating an investment plan to retrofit the building.
What is the Current Condition of the Building?
There are two complementary ways to assess the performance of your building: benchmarking tells you how well it performs compared with other properties of similar characteristics, while energy audits can give a detailed breakdown of energy consumption, making it easier to identify the most promising building upgrades. The ENERGY STAR score from the US Environmental Protection Agency provides an excellent tool for buildings to compare their performance with similar buildings from throughout the country – buildings with a score of 75 or more earn ENERGY STAR certification, where the maximum value is 100.
Proposing energy efficiency measures without knowing the actual condition of a building is basically a trial-and-error approach, and property owners are strongly advised against it. On the other hand, benchmarking allows property owners to set realistic targets, while energy audits provide a feasibility study. Energy audits may also reveal opportunities for recommissioning: minor adjustments to operating parameters and controls, along with simple reparations, which yield performance improvements at minimal cost.
When an energy audit is completed, the total cost of all the measures proposed may be too high for building owners to assume at once. If this is the case, a set of measures may be given priority due to their ease of implementation or high financial return. Upgrades to electrical systems tend to offer the highest return on investment due to the high cost of electricity, but upgrades to combustion-based appliances tend to eliminate the most emissions. Keep in mind that some measures may be mandatory according to local building codes and legislation.
Financial analysis of building upgrades also provides a basis for investment decisions. Businesses often use financing for major building upgrades, to minimize the impact on their cash flow. Building upgrades that have operating savings higher than debt service are especially attractive, since they can pay for their own cost.
Architectural Engineering the Suggested Building Upgrades
Your city may have a broad range of building codes, and the ones that apply depend on the type of project. The technical requirements are demanding across the board, but especially in the case of fire protection systems and combustion-based appliances. The best recommendation is to work with a qualified engineering firm throughout the entire process, from design to commissioning.
Many property owners decide to start with lighting upgrades, for many reasons outlined below. In fact, the US EPA recommends these building upgrades as a first step in any major building retrofit.
The procedure is simple and less disruptive than other upgrades, while offering a payback period of just a few years, and in certain cases less than one year.
Lighting upgrades may be eligible for cash rebates from Con Edison, further increasing their financial return. Depending on building characteristics and location, some lighting upgrades may be available for free.
Lighting upgrades do not depend on other building systems, and in turn, they can achieve synergy with subsequent ones. For example, LED lighting is easier to integrate with building controls, and also reduces the design load for air-conditioning upgrades.
Compared with other building upgrades, lighting retrofits are relatively simple to design and approve.
After lighting upgrades, the recommendation is to proceed with measures that reduce heating and cooling loads. Financial analysis is very important here, since these measures tend to show a broad variation in cost. For example, caulking and weather stripping are quick and affordable, while upgrading to high-performance windows can require a significant capital and time commitment.
A logical next step is HVAC, since the previous upgrades tend to reduce its load. As a result, the new equipment can be specified with a higher efficiency and a lower capacity, boosting the savings achieved. From the technical standpoint, it makes sense to upgrade ventilation systems first: many ventilation systems are oversized, increasing the required heating and cooling capacity due to excessive airflow.
With an optimally-sized ventilation system, adequate room temperatures can be achieved with less heating and cooling. In addition to optimizing capacity, ventilation systems can be equipped with energy recovery to further reduce heating and cooling loads.
Working with qualified architectural engineering professionals is important throughout the entire building upgrade process, but the stakes tend to be higher once property managers are dealing with HVAC. These upgrades are expensive and disruptive but can also yield significant performance improvements. However, for this same reason, it is very important to get them right – HVAC systems involve a complex interaction between many components that cannot be analyzed in isolation.

New collaborative senior care model cuts costs, improves outcomes
BY Mark Sanchez Sunday, October 29, 2017 12:20pm
GRAND RAPIDS — The success of a collaboration that set out three years ago to improve care for seniors with an array of health problems shows what can happen when cooperation trumps competition.
It also demonstrates the potential benefits for health insurers that are willing to put up money to try something new.
In three years, Tandem365 reduced emergency room visits among its 1,000 clients by 52 percent. Inpatient hospital stays declined 38 percent and visits to specialty physicians decreased 46 percent.
The declines came by better coordinating care and addressing issues such as medication adherence and by organizing assistance for household chores or errands, meal preparation, shopping and transportation to a doctor’s office.
From a financial standpoint, the program resulted in a 35 percent per-member reduction in the cost to treat people.
Meanwhile, individuals with multiple chronic medical conditions enrolled in Tandem365 realize a better quality of life by alleviating some of the emotional toll related to their illnesses.
“You look at the dollars, but look at the people,” said Steve Zuiderveen, president and CEO of Sunset Retirement Communities and Services. “The dollar savings is wonderful, but the people cost is much more significant.”
Sunset Retirement Communities is one of four Grand Rapids senior living and long-term care providers behind Tandem365, along with Life EMS Ambulance, whose professionals are on the front line of responding when a patient calls 911 for assistance.
The Grand Rapids-based collaborative coordinates medical, behavioral health and social services for people 55 and older who have multiple chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, emphysema, dementia, kidney failure, Parkinson’s and diabetes. Oftentimes, the patients are in frail health, lack a social support network, and could use daily or weekly assistance at home.
The goal is to keep them out of the hospital or ER by coordinating teams of case managers, nurses, social workers, paramedics, therapists and aides.
‘BETTER FOR THE PATIENT’
The key to the service is a partnership with Grand Rapids-based Priority Health, which in 2014 agreed to reimburse for the kind of care, services and coordination that Tandem365 provides.
Health insurers historically haven’t paid for those kinds of non-traditional services to members. That changed when Tandem365 went looking for a partner and approached Priority Health, which signed on to reimburse the organization a certain amount per client for coordinating care.
The high acuity level and high cost of the patient population Tandem365 targets led to Priority Health’s willingness to invest in the program, and to help craft a new care model for the people who cost the most to insure.
“We all knew and we know now that the traditional model of care doesn’t work for this group of patients,” said Dr. Greg Gadbois, medical director at Priority Health. “It makes sense for us to fund it. It’s better for the patient.”
The money spent up front by Priority Health more than pays for itself through reduced medical claims on the back end, Gadbois said. The net savings comes to about $300 per member, per month.
The program’s cost savings exceeds the amount of medical claims and the total Priority Health pays Tandem365 for services, which Gadbois describes as a “lifeline that can keep them out of the hospital.”
“That’s significant (savings), potentially, over a long period of time,” he said. “That’s an admission we don’t have to pay for because we saved someone from having to go through the hassle, and having to go through the pain and suffering that got them into the hospital again. That’s the way it should be.”
SETTING THE STAGE
The seeds for what became Tandem365 were planted in 2012 when Mercy Health Saint Mary’s approached the four senior living and long-term care providers — Sunset, Clark Retirement Community, Porter Hills and Holland Home — for help in reducing a 22-percent 30-day readmission rate for Medicare patients. At the time, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was preparing to begin penalizing hospitals for high readmission rates.
In agreeing to work with Saint Mary’s, the long-term care providers needed to set aside their competitive instincts and instead cooperate with one another.
“We were very much independent and looking out for our own, trying to carry our own weight with the hospitals and get referrals,” said Teresa Toland, the CEO at Tandem365 who previously ran the home care division and was vice president of business development and quality at Porter Hills.
As staff from the four organizations began to get together and talk, they soon came to a realization, she said.
“We all had the same issues,” Toland said. “Every one of us had the same struggle.”
The biggest barrier to overcome was a lack of coordination and communication between care providers when a patient transitions from a hospital to a long-term care setting or to his or her home. By addressing that and a “laundry list” of other issues, the group was able to reduce the 30-day readmission rate at Saint Mary’s from 22 percent to 4 percent within a year and a half.
That initial success laid the groundwork for what became Tandem365.
“We said, ‘Why stop here?’” Toland said.
ADDRESSING PAYMENT
The group went back to work and “defined everything in the health care system that would cause” a failure by a patient and lead to an ER visit or a hospital readmission, she said.
They largely identified social issues that get in the way of proper care for the so-called “at-risk” patients who often have little or no social support at home to help manage their medical conditions. As a result, they showed up frequently in the ER. The group concluded that the kind of help needed for the targeted patient population could come from social service agencies in the community.
But they still faced a major challenge in determining who pays for the service.
“All of the things they require, insurance doesn’t pay for it,” Toland said.
So the group approached Priority Health, which was willing to support a pilot program. The four long-term care providers and Life EMS also collectively put in $1.5 million that provided the financial support needed to launch the pilot.
ADJUSTING THE MODEL
Under the pilot, Priority Health selected the patients for participation in Tandem365 from its Medicare health plan enrollees. Under the program, when members have issues, they are to call Tandem365, where a dispatcher is trained to triage their situations.
If the call is for a medical issue, Tandem365 dispatches paramedics from Life EMS to the home to assess the situation. The paramedics can transport members to the ER, if needed. If the members do not require transport but still need assistance for another issue, they are connected with a person or organization that can help.
“We’re coordinating the village,” said Life EMS CEO Mark Meijer, noting that he — like the executives at the four long-term care providers — had to adjust his thinking when joining the group.
If an ambulance isn’t transporting a person to the hospital, Life EMS isn’t billing for it, Meijer said. He got over that issue by focusing instead on how Life EMS could provide a new service by participating in Tandem365 and improving care for patients.
Meijer concluded the new organization could reduce the number of times that Life EMS transported someone to an emergency room when they actually did not need the service.
Sometimes, for instance, people can feel ill because they do not take their medications properly. Through Tandem365, responding paramedics or nurses can work with the people to get them back on track.
“We intuitively knew this makes sense,” Meijer said. “We intuitively knew by experience this would work.”
FINDING THE MOST IMPACT
Tandem365 initially asked Priority Health for 20 referrals of patients who received care at home. The program has steadily expanded and today serves about 600 people monthly in Kent, Ottawa and Allegan counties.
Tandem365 now is expanding into Kalamazoo County and recently signed a contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan for reimbursement. Final details of the deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield have yet to be worked out, Toland said.
While Tandem365 has generated strong results in the first few years, partners say there are limits to the program’s expansion.
A new market needs to have the social service and structure in place to properly execute the program, as well as a large enough eligible patient population to justify the investment and the willing participation of long-term care providers.
The model works best where there’s a higher concentration of patients.
“That’s where we make the most impact,” Meijer said. “We’re expanding at a pace that is kind of sensible.”
Priority Health would “love” to see Tandem365 expand into more markets outside of the Grand Rapids area, Gadbois said, although he recognizes the limitations, particularly for rural counties.
“You need a certain number of patients to support that team,” he said.

The 2016 election ended a year ago, but no one, especially Trump, seems to have noticed
By Emily C. Singer | Nov. 8, 2017
It’s been just over a year since Donald Trump stunned the nation by winning the Electoral College over Hillary Clinton to ascend to the highest office in the country.
Yet if you went into a nuclear fallout shelter the day before the election and emerged a year later, you’d have no idea the election had ever ended.
Trump and the conservative media that seeks to boost his presidency are still attacking Clinton as if she were still a candidate — calling for even more investigations into her campaign and tenure as secretary of state, despite the fact she’s no longer a candidate and doesn’t plan to be in the future.
And Democrats are still litigating the Democratic primary between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders that ended nearly two years ago, when Clinton clinched the nomination.
It’s an intra-party battle that Trump is all too excited to glom onto as he tries to change the subject from the federal investigation into his campaign’s potential Russian ties, which has already led to the indictment of two of his former top campaign aides, as well as a guilty plea from another.
Days before the one-year anniversary of his win, Trump was tweeting about the Democratic primary the same way he did months earlier, when he was trying to court disgruntled Sanders supporters to his side.
“Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!” Trump tweeted on November 3, reprising his nickname for Clinton.
It’s a tweet that would make the average user look twice to check what date it was really sent, as it looked nearly identical to his tweets from 2016 commenting on the Democratic primary.
Aside from focusing on the Democratic primary, Trump’s other favorite pastime is calling for Clinton to be investigated and prosecuted whenever bad news emerges about he and his own administration’s behavior.
On Oct. 29, as the country waited for Mueller to announce the first indictments, Trump went on a tear, questioning why the Department of Justice wasn’t looking into controversies around Democrats that he and his supporters ginned up.
“Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more,” Trump tweeted. “Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia ‘collusion,’ which doesn’t exist.”
Trump went on to say “DO SOMETHING!” — seeming to suggest the Justice Department investigate his political opponents.
And as the fallout from Mueller’s indictments continued — leading to yet another one of his political nominees to withdraw over the Russia scrutiny — Trump sent multiple tweets expressing frustration that the FBI was investigating people surrounding him and not Clinton.
“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” Trump tweeted.
While it’s not true that “everybody” was asking that question, it’s certainly what conservative media outlets like Fox News were asking.
Clinton has been one of Fox News’ favorite subjects during Trump’s first 10 months in office.
That’s especially true for Sean Hannity, who tries to change the subject to Clinton whenever Trump is in hot water.
The night Mueller announced his indictments, Hannity got himself into such a frenzy over trying to change the subject to Clinton that he made a Freudian slip, falling her “President Clinton.”
It’s unclear when — if ever — the 2016 talk will ever end.
But what is clear is that Trump doesn’t seem to want it to.
Clinton is his favorite, and easiest, foe to attack, and his shrinking base still eats up the storyline.
Until that changes, America will likely continue to re-live the 2016 campaign.

Moon to raise Japanese abductee issue in North Korea summit

SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of — South Korean President Moon Jae-in plans to raise the issue of Japanese citizens who were abducted decades ago by North Korea in his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this week.
Moon told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a telephone conversation that resolving the issue would contribute to peace in Northeast Asia, Moon spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said Tuesday.
Moon is to meet Kim on Friday at the border village of Panmunjom in a rare summit between the Koreas. The rivals remain technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Seoul says the summit will focus on North Korea’s nuclear disarmament. Seoul has also brokered a meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump which is expected in May or June.
Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train its agents in Japanese language and culture to spy on South Korea.
North Korea has acknowledged abducting 13 Japanese in the 1970s. It allowed five of them to visit Japan in 2002 and they stayed. North Korea says eight others have died, but their families say the North’s statement cannot be trusted.
Trump said he promised Abe during a meeting in Washington last week that he would work hard for the return of Japanese abducted by North Korea.
During their telephone conversation, Abe asked Moon whether there was any likelihood of declaring an official end to the Korea War in his talks with Kim, according to Moon’s spokesman. Moon replied that ending the war would require the consent of at least three parties — the Koreas and the United States — and that he would work closely with Washington and Tokyo to create favourable conditions for such an agreement, the spokesman said.
While Trump has given his “blessing” for the Koreas to discuss an end to the war, there can be no real solution without the involvement of Washington and other parties that fought in the war because South Korea wasn’t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting.

Bupa Kelvin Lodge Dental Centre
77 Elmfield Rd, Newcastle upon Tyne NE3 4BY, UK – 0191 285 1150
Outstanding customer care and results are the reasons I can unreservedly recommend Kelvin Lodge. After making the decision to improve my smile with braces, I made appointments with various practices and felt after meeting with Dr James Bough that I had found a lovely establishment with plenty of friendly staff and a dental professional who would make every effort to create the smile I wanted. In addition to the skill and knowledge of Dr Bough, I felt at ease during every visit due to the friendly manner of dental nurse Nicole Assimacopoulos and the welcoming reception staff. Although clearly a busy practice, there was always someone available to answer the phone if I needed to call and to assist me when I arrived. Whilst location isn’t the primary reason to choose a practice, it was enjoyable to visit such a lovely house in its well-kept grounds. I opted for tooth coloured fixed braces for both the upper and lower arch and my treatment lasted a total of around five months. During this time, only one bracket came loose and after a panicked call to the emergency number, Dr Bough called me straight back and put my mind at ease with information about what to expect and offered to make an emergency next day appointment to reattach the bracket. A lot of my friends have asked me about braces and my experiences and I would say that for me, the best part of completing the 6 Month Smile is that I no longer have to worry about the angle of a camera or think about how to smile so that my teeth are hidden. My friends always question the same thing: the price. It’s one of those ‘big expenditures’ in life and whilst not as restrictive as buying a car or saving for a deposit on a house, it’s certainly a big commitment. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my treatment plan included professional whitening and the filling of some chipped teeth at the extremely reasonable quote I’d been given which was a welcome bonus. It’s my belief that if more people knew they were paying for ‘a perfect smile’ with all the extras that’s needed to make that happen as opposed to ‘a brace’ then it would be easier to see why the expenditure is worthwhile. And it really is worthwhile. My smile has gone from being the thing I hid to being the first thing people compliment me on and I now look forward to smiling in photographs.
Fawdon Family Dental Practice
1 Station Cottages, Fawdon, Newcastle upon Tyne NE3 2RJ, UK – 0191 284 3882
My husband rang this practice 15.8.18 as an emergency new patient and was seen same morning for temporary work. Returned following day... 40 minute dental repair.. all staff were excellent and very impressed with the service... well done!
First time I have been to this dentist. Had root canal and filling and they were fantastic. On time, efficient and professional. Would highly recommend them
The Grange Dental Centre
61 Great N Rd, Newcastle upon Tyne NE3 2DQ, UK – 0191 213 0188
I moved dentists to this practice after I was asked to wait close to 3 weeks for a filling appointment at another practice. I was seen quickly and had the work completed within a week from registering. I have never had to wait a long time for an appointment, although I can be quite flexible with when I can attend, so if you want evenings and weekends I don't know how this would be. However, for a dental practice, the amount of appointments out of 9-5 exceeds that available at other practices. My dentist is Alex. I am a little anxious about my dental care and the look of my teeth, for that reason I seek out perfection in my care and cosmetic results. I honestly cannot fault Alex's work and I am so happy with both the dental care and the cosmetic result of his interventions. The receptionists are always pleasant and helpful. Its so lovely to find a dental practice that has great customer service and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to other people.
Wonderful dentists. I've seen a few different dentists here and all have been friendly and professional. Great at putting you at ease. Would definitely recommend!

CPUC Authorizes Record Spending For SCE Energy-Efficiency Programs
CPUC Authorizes Record Spending For SCE Energy-Efficiency Programs
September 22, 2005
September 22, 2005
Background: The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) today authorized a significant increase in funding for the 2006-08 energy-efficiency programs managed by the state’s investor-owned utilities, including Southern California Edison (SCE). The CPUC's approval of $675 million for SCE’s energy-efficiency programs will be the most in company history. The decision also authorized the largest financial commitment to energy efficiency by any state in history. In response, SCE offered the following statement.
ROSEMEAD, Calif., Sept. 22, 2005—We are pleased the commission approved every energy-efficiency initiative SCE proposed for the coming years.
We encourage our customers to participate in the many energy-efficiency programs available to them, including, among other things, SCE’s rebates and financial incentives to reduce the cost of energy efficient appliances and equipment, our refrigerator/freezer recycling program, our free on-line energy audits for homes and businesses, as well as the statewide 20/20 Summer Savings Program, SCE’s Summer Discount Plan and programmable thermostat program.
While reducing the need to build more power plants, SCE’s energy efficiency programs can save our customers millions of dollars in energy costs, create jobs in California, and help protect and preserve California’s precious natural resources.
Over the past five years, SCE’s energy-efficiency programs have achieved the largest energy savings of any such program in the nation, in effect eliminating the need to build a 500-megawatt power plant. In fact, SCE has one of the nation’s largest portfolios of energy-efficiency programs.
In its decision, the CPUC noted that the 2006-08 utility programs will help avoid the need to build the equivalent of three large power plants over the next three years and will produce environmental benefits equivalent to taking about 650,000 cars off the road.
SCE's success and leadership in managing energy efficiency programs benefiting customers has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and numerous national energy efficiency organizations.
Customers can visit www.sce.com/RebatesandSavings to learn more about the many ways they can save energy and money through SCE's energy-efficiency programs.

1 Year after Hurricane Maria, NJAMHAA Promotes Trauma Awareness for National Hispanic Heritage Month
October 15, 2018
MERCERVILLE, NJ - Slightly more than one year ago, Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, resulting in significant loss of life and property, as well as severe trauma among the island's residents.
New Jersey residents assisted Puerto Rico by sending state troopers and relief supplies, and by accommodating families impacted by the hurricane in their communities. The majority of Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. mainland are concentrated in the New York Metropolitan Area, with New Jersey being home to the nation's third-largest Puerto Rican population. With so many people who have personal and familial connections to the destruction of Hurricane Maria, the state's Puerto Rican community over the past year has placed crucial focus on the havoc a traumatic event can wreak on an individual's health.
The New Jersey Association of Mental Health and Addiction Agencies, Inc. (NJAMHAA) is a trade association representing New Jersey community-based providers of behavioral healthcare services, which can be found in every county statewide and annually serve 500,000 individuals of all backgrounds. New Jersey's behavioral health community has always been an important voice in advocating for access to mental health services for people who experience traumatic events.
"Our member providers are located in communities all over the state, and in many areas with high concentrations of Puerto Rican and Hispanic residents. The clinicians who serve these populations themselves are trained in multicultural competency, and many provide services in English and Spanish. Our members are committed to providing trauma-informed care and recovery services to all people who are struggling with mental illnesses or substance use disorders, and have all been highly concerned about the impact of post-Hurricane Maria trauma on our state's Puerto Rican population," said Debra L. Wentz, Ph.D., President and CEO of NJAMHAA.
The one-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria coincides with the annual National Hispanic Heritage Month observance, taking place September 15th to October 15th, which recognizes the historic and present contributions of the Hispanic populations to the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Puerto Rican people make up the second-largest subcategory of the overall Hispanic population by origin-slightly more than 9%.
NJAMHAA works to advance behavioral health awareness for Puerto Rican and Hispanic residents, as well as to bridge gaps in the delivery of essential services. Multicultural issues are always a salient subject of critical discussion at NJAMHAA's meetings and conferences. Additionally, NJAMHAA's charitable subsidiary, the New Jersey Mental Health Institute (NJMHI), has conducted extensive research and reported on improving mental health outcomes for the Hispanic population through its nationally and internationally recognized project, Changing Minds, Advancing Mental Health for Hispanics.
Beyond the mass trauma that the Puerto Rican community has been dealing with, America's overall Hispanic population is continuing to cope with the anxiety of an increasingly racialized political rhetoric and uncertain future prospects for undocumented people, including potential family separations. While young Hispanics have the highest rates of depression of any ethnic group, they continue to encounter multiple barriers, including cultural and linguistic differences, in accessing healthcare services. For instance, nearly a quarter of Hispanics in New Jersey have no health insurance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of Minority Health provides informational resources on health disparities, and tips to help individuals navigate the healthcare system and obtain services, at their website at www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/OMH/index.html.
Through the work of NJAMHAA-affiliated groups and agencies, Puerto Rican and Hispanic people living in New Jersey have increased access to life-saving trauma-informed behavioral healthcare services that enable their families and communities to achieve meaningful recovery. As the rebuilding of Puerto Rico continues, NJAMHAA calls on state, federal, and nonprofit stakeholders to work toward expanding access to behavioral health services, and especially to care that addresses the impact of trauma on mental and overall health.

Nice as F**k Will Make You Get Off Your Ass and Do Something
Jenny Lewis, Tennessee Thomas, and Erika Spring formed a band out of the friendship, and in doing so realized the power of community giving a damn.

It's a sticky Friday in late July and something is afoot on 1st Avenue, in New York's East Village. Next to the higgledy-piggledy vintage store, A Repeat Performance, stands The Deep End Club, the storefront window filled with balloons, a small keyboard, and an enormous peace sign lit with bare bulbs. But this front store façade—with its corrugated shutter graffitied with the word COOL, in pink bubble letters—is largely obscured by an orderly line of well-dressed music fans from their teens to late 30s. They're standing three or four deep, filing down the block towards 9th Street and round the corner.
Inside the narrow store everything is for sale, totes and t-shirts emblazoned with Give a Damn, friendship bracelets and petite watercolor portraits. The bookshelves are stacked. Warhol, Howard L Bingham's The Black Panthers, Radical Prototypes: Allan Kaprow and the Invention of Happenings, stand alongside choice LPs—Nina Simone's Gifted & Black, The Ronettes. Cutouts of Bob Dylan and Patti Smith oversee the swiftly filling space, soon to be sardined with friends and fans of Nice As Fuck—or NAF for primetime TV—the band made up of Jenny Lewis, Erika Spring, and Tennessee Thomas. Beers are passed around, no one knows who bought them.

Decked out in matching berets, NAF tees, and camo, the trio kick into "Runaway": Tennessee on the store floor kicking out a skippy beat, Erika working the descending bass line, the guitar resting on her blooming baby bump, and then there's Jenny in her silver booties, shoulder-shimmying on the tiny elevated storefront-turned-stage. She flips between addressing the fans in front of her and those on the street, hand pressed to the pane that separates them. NAF's songs are deliciously unfettered—you can catch the hook and sing-along by the second verse. It's a step and half away from the kind of music each artist has made elsewhere. Surprisingly, Jenny sites an early love of hip-hop as an influence, eventually tracing some samples back to bands like New York post-punk act ESG. "I didn't even know I loved ESG and then when I found them in the early 2000s it was like, wow this is the kind of music I want to make," she explains. "But I was making emo indie rock at the time with a lot of guitars. So now I find myself, at almost 40 years old, embracing my inner hip-hop spirit. It was the perfect opportunity to ditch the guitar and dub out my vocals."
Tennessee relays a too true tale of the modern date flake and the crowd titters with the recognition of shared experience, as Jenny slinks: "Are you even still alive? / I think I just got ghosted by cookie lips." She doesn't sound like the Jenny we know from her solo records, or Rilo Kiley, rather, her honeyed tones are heavily echoed and wonderfully warped throughout. NAF's tunes are personal, but their self-titled album—nine songs that whiz by in under 25-minutes—are also marked by rabble rousing political undertones. As the set draws to a close those assembled are soon chanting along: "I don't wanna be afraid / Put your guns away." The whole performance is joyous and loose, intimate and inclusive.
Outside the orderly line has morphed into a sprawl that spills off the sidewalk and obstructs passersby (and the occasional bus). Friends of NAF loiter and exchange hellos—there's Alexa Chung and her boyfriend, actor AlexanderSkarsgård, singer Thomas Cohen (formerly of the band SCUM), Luke Rathborne, members of Mother, and Public Access TV. "It feels like the East Village back in the day," notes Rathborne. The singer directed their recent video for "Guns." That's back in the day before, as locals like to complain, this formerly gritty enclave turned into a giant NYU campus.
The Deep End Club is the brainchild of Tennessee Thomas, who became a cool kid on the block back in the early aughts, when she was still a teenager, playing drums in her 60s girl group-inspired band The Like. Born in London, Tennessee relocated to LA while she was still in school, so her accent is British softened with transatlanticism. Her father is Pete Thomas, Elvis Costello's longtime drummer, who also contributed beats to Jenny's 2008 LP Acid Tongue. Tennessee first met Jenny years earlier when their respective bands were playing local shows with the likes of Phantom Planet. "At one point she said, 'I like you, you remind me of me,'" laughs Tennessee. "And then we were mani-pedi friends."
The Like split in 2011 and not long after, Tennessee made a break for New York, leaving her drum kit behind. Feeling lost and heartbroken after the band's dissolution, she split her time DJing and A&Ring for an indie label. It wasn't until her exposure to the Occupy Movement that the now 31-year-old felt a renewed sense of purpose.
"Just hearing everyone talking about what was going on in the world and talking to strangers about all these different issues—there was this whole community of really sweet people who were really concerned, but also creative and artistic," she recalls. Along with 11 other occupiers, Tennessee set up the Awareness Experiment. "It was like a town hall meeting and we had think tanks on different issues," she explains. The topics on the table were vast: climate change, equality, money's sway on politics. "I thought it'd be amazing to have a space for those conversations to continue."

In 2013 Thomas signed the lease for 156 1st Avenue and christened it The Deep End Club, a nod to her dad's wild days when he and his buddies would abide by the rule of jumping in pools, fully clothed, when anyone announced a "Deep End Club meeting." It started as a six month pop-up shop, but instantly became a welcoming HQ, stocking the wares of her friends and vintage finds. Occasionally bands would play sweaty, impromptu shows (The Black Lips), and book groups sometimes descended into love life story swapping sessions, but it was also a space where, before the 2014 People's Climate March, likeminded sorts gathered to paint protest signs before joining the walk en masse. It was during this period that she formed a friendship with Erika, who played synth in Brooklyn dream pop trio Au Revoir Simone. Both are frequently told they look the spit of Laura Dern.
Last fall Jenny arrived from LA, following in Tennessee's black and white saddle shoe-clad footsteps. Why did Jenny wind up in the Big Apple? The same reason as so many before her, Tennessee included: a clean slate. Or as Jenny bluntly states: "A break up." She continues: "I felt like a runaway, an orphan. I had no idea where to go and Tennessee's shop was a place that I could just loiter every single day. After a few weeks I was like OK, I need to play some music."
Without The Deep End Club and the community that formed from it, there would be no Nice as Fuck. Jenny convinced Tennessee to dust off her sticks and the trio began jamming out songs during opening hours with the store's door propped open wide. "I remember we started playing 'Runaway' or 'Door' and people would stop outside," says Tennessee. "It's hard to get people to stop in New York, so we'd go, alright that's a keeper. That's kind of how the songs formed themselves. It was so interactive!"
"People talk about how you should play new songs live on tour before you record them, but we were getting that feedback in real time," says Erika, who'd never played bass until the band came together.
"Tennessee gave me a safe place to hangout and find myself again," says Jenny. "The songs reflect the feeling in the shop, but every song has a flipside of a woman coming to New York for the first time and rediscovering herself. It's the most pure thing I've ever been apart of." One day M. Ward dropped by and was so impressed he offered them the opening slot on his Spring tour. Further galvanized by this opportunity, they finished the set of songs that makes up their debut.
Today may be a celebration of the band, the store, and its creative hub, but it's also, sadly, shutters for the Club. Still, it's less the end of an era, and more onto the next chapter, which aligns perfectly with their song "Door," a tune Jenny says is at the record's heart. "The sentiment of 'Door' is of just sort of leaving the door open," she explains. "There are endless possibilities within your relationships, within your relationship with the world, and I think it speaks to all of the things we were feeling at The Deep End Club. It's not one thing or the other really it can apply to everything."
Twenty minutes later NAF play their succinct set all over again so fans who couldn't gain access initially, can squeeze their way in for a better view. No one wants to call time on the good vibes.
&amp;amp;amp;lt;span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;gt;
The following week I see the girls again, this time in LA where they're opening for Ryan Adams at The Greek, a hollowed out amphitheater at the foot of Griffith Park. It's magic hour when they sassily strut out to the theme tune from Jem and the Holograms—all synths and 80s pizzazz. They huddle close, as if the parameters tonight are the same as The Deep End Club, and not a spacious stage. Truly, this vantage point is too remote for the band. If they had their way they'd be playing in the middle of the floor surrounded by a dancing audience.
"I went to see Lightning Bolt with Black Dice in 2001 and I just remember being the most interactive show I'd ever been to and just that energy with people playing on the floor was something I couldn't shake," explains Jenny, in the bowels of the backstage after their set. "When we started talking about playing outside of the shop I thought, whoa that would be an amazing thing to pull off."
Erika adds: "There's also this real sense of unknown—we don't know what's going to happen, they don't know what's going to happen—and it creates this awesome tension and increases the spirit of it."
"Where I was coming from in my life, I didn't feel I wanted to be on a stage in front of people, because I was rediscovering music and rediscovering myself," finishes Jenny. Given that the singer has been in the spotlight in one form or another since the 80s, it's easy to imagine how thrilled Jenny must've been to find herself looking at music and performance from a fresh perspective. This reawakening is certainly critical to the band's appeal, her sense of liberation, coupled with the verve of Erika and Tennessee, translates from the top down.
"I've never seen a band set up on the floor of the Bowery Ballroom and connect with an audience in that type of intimate way," Jonah Bayer of United Nations and co-creator of web series Sound Advice, (alongside SNL's Vanessa Bayer), told me recently. "Watching them you can tell it isn't a publicity stunt; they mean it and it's about as punk as you can get."
As he quite rightly points out, there's no way this trio, with one slim record to their name, could've sold out two shows at Bowery Ballroom and another at Music Hall of Williamsburg, playing to nearly 2000 people in two days, but thanks to Jenny rep for selling out these spaces on her own, she's got the clout to make it happen. "It's really cool that she's able to use her influence and legacy in order to mold NAF into this sort of revolutionary band," he says. "It's as brave as it is unexpected. I mean, who else does that?"
NAF live at the Troubador in LA.
Nice as Fuck made their live debut proper in April, at a Bernie Sanders benefit concert, Bern NY Bern. The girls have been extremely vocal in their support. Erika boils down the senator's appeal to the fact that "he's a real humanitarian and he wants our society to support our people." For a time The Deep End Club seemed like an unofficial campaign office, where you could register to vote, and find out more about his policies. Naturally, they were crushed when he was out of the running, but all affirm that his message still resonates.
Tennessee recounts one of his last NYC speeches: "He just said don't lose your outrage about things that are outrageous. Just walking past a homeless person—this isn't OK. He really put his finger on the Wall Street thing, these 20 people have more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. It's just so fucked. To think we're not more outraged is confusing. That's just the nature of how brainwashed we all are. But I think our generation had been kind of cynical and removed, and it's been interesting seeing all of our friends mature and grow up and go, alright some of our friends are having kids and what sort of world is this. It's real important stuff."
They're not so naïve to think that the mantra from "Guns—"The solution is revolution"—will affect quantifiable change, but Erika highlights the fact that the store, and indeed the band, has helped create a community where there was once nothing. It's less about preaching and more about provoking discussion—sparking inspiration, and building from there.
"It's like we were riding this wave and it was so inspiring and empowering, it brought so many people together," says Tennessee. "It was just a burst of excitement! It's not like there's a simple answer, you have to keep fighting, there's no solutions, it's like, we're working on this issue, then this issue pops back up. We have to make it a part of our lives to keep working on these things."
For Jenny, music is personal first and foremost. "It's saved my life," she says matter of factly.
Clustered on the couch back in the dressing room at the Greek, the girls are upbeat but reflective. This was their final show as NAF, for now at least. Tears were shed during soundcheck. "I cry during every show," says Jenny. "That's why she uses waterproof eyeliner," half-jokes Tennessee. That eyeliner, feline black flicks, is applied nightly by Tennessee. "It's the perfect moment before the show," says Jenny. "She takes care of us, brings us together, and makes us feel beautiful and witchy." But after tonight the matching outfits—white bellbottoms and army green shirts—will be packed away.
Barely a month later The Deep End Club will be rechristened The Modern Love Club, founded by another enterprising girl with a penchant for vintage clothes. It's a matchmaking service by day and a date spot-cum-gallery at night. Currently the work showcased features only female-created art. There's a new lick of paint, but the plastic 60s lighting fixtures remain. The new takes over, but the old lingers if you look close. That's the rhythm a metropolis sways to.
For Nice as Fuck, it's time to go back to the real world: Jenny to her solo commitments, Erika to impending motherhood, all except Tennessee who back in August had immediate plans to explore Northern California with a boy who recently bowled her over. "He packed my drums up," she says smiling broadly. "No boy has ever done that before! Well timed, thanks universe, otherwise I'd be having a mental break down right now!"
Will Jenny return to LA, a city and music scene with which she's long been synonymous? She shrugs, "I don't know. The door is open." Other challenges, more adventures undoubtedly await. "I'm scared but excited because that's me," Jenny says lightly. "You can't be a runaway forever."

CMT honors only women at annual Artists of the Year show

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — CMT is changing their Artists of the Year show to honor only women, including Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert, Kelsea Ballerini, Maren Morris, Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman of Little Big Town and Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum.
The move comes as female artists in the genre have been outspoken about the lack of opportunities for them. Women have been shut out of nominations for major country awards, such as CMA’s entertainer of the year category for two years in a row, and men overwhelmingly dominate country radio charts.
CMT senior vice president of music and talent Leslie Fram said she hopes dedicating the entire show to women in country music — past, present and future— will spark a “much-needed change in the industry.” The show airs on CMT on Oct. 17 at 8 p.m.
“This year, we’re evolving the special to reflect what’s happening right now in culture and in the lives of our fans,” Fram said in a statement.
The network started a “Women of Country” campaign in 2013 as a way to bring more airplay to female artists, including Ballerini and Morris, and has expanded it into a tour. The network is also doing a daylong “Women of Country Music” takeover across all CMT platforms leading up to their show.
Three years ago, a radio consultant garnered national attention for recommending that stations limit the number of female country artists they play to boost ratings, using the analogy of tomatoes in a salad.
Many female artists including Morris, Cam and Underwood have all spoken out against a prevailing opinion in the industry that female fans don’t want to listen to female artists. Underwood also recently announced a national tour next year that will include only female opening acts, including Maddie and Tae and Runaway June.
Additional performers for the Artists of the Year show will be announced at a later date.

Oath Keepers: President Trump, Call Out National Guard to Protect Schools!

National Guard Deployed to Airports Nationwide After 9/11.
In the wake of yet another deadly school shooting, we call on President Trump, as Commander in Chief, to declare a national emergency and call up all National Guard units into federal service and deploy them to protect schools across the nation. Those National Guard personnel must be armed, with loaded weapons, and they need to stand guard each and every school-day until a permanent solution is found that actually protects the schools, such as armed School Resource Officers or armed guards in every school, retired police officers and military veterans serving as armed volunteer defenders, or armed and trained teachers and other school staff and parent volunteers (as Sheriff Judd does in Polk County, FL). But that solution or combination of solutions must be comprehensive, in each and every school.
As we have stated before, along with hardening the schools to make it harder for shooters to gain access, the only way to effectively secure schools against such attacks is to have on-site armed and trained defenders in each school who can put a stop to the attack at the outset or in the first critical moments. It simply takes too long for responding officers to arrive and stop the killing. Every minute that goes by gives the attacker more time to kill and injure more victims. There must be armed defenders already at the school, as they can respond far faster than any outside officers possibly can. Anything less than on-site armed defenders will continue to leave students and staff undefended soft targets exposed to any madman or terrorist who wants to kill children and teachers to make a name for himself on the news.
The nation of Israel figured that out long ago, and routinely has armed teachers and school staff protecting their school children. They do so because that is what works. We need to do the same by whatever mechanism, be it local, state or Federal, and whether with paid defenders or volunteers.
Until that is done, President Trump should deploy the National Guard in federal service, and pay them using DOD funds. The National Guard was used to defend airports, train stations, dams, and bus depots all over the country after 9/11. If they can be used to protect those soft targets against terrorism, they can be used to protect schools. If the National Guard can be called into federal service and sent to fight oversees in Iraq and Afghanistan, they can be used here at home to defend this nation’s students and teachers. They are called the National Guard, after all. President Trump must put them to use guarding the nation where it matters most.
The National Guard Can Assist Local LEOs in Protecting Schools, Just as They Did Airports After 9/11
Pass the word and let President Trump know it is time for him to act in a decisive way to defend America’s school children. He has both the authority to do so, as Commander in Chief, and the duty. And when he does, he will have the full support of the majority of the American people, and most certainly the support of the military veterans and retired police officers who would be willing to step in and help too, if given the chance. Urge President Trump to do what is right and what must be done – call the National Guard into Federal service to defend the schools.

This is a decent idea, but I don’t the National Guard has enough resources to guard the numerous schools that exist in each state. Trump would have to recall retired military personnel or ask for military/police volunteers to accept this mission. With those additional resources, I believe it is an excellent idea.

No we don’t need a military police state. We need prayer, the Bible, God, Jesus Christ back into our public schools. We need to stop the everyday slaughter of our babies in the abortion chambers of death. How can God protect and bless American with the everyday mass murder of babies at 5,500 deaths everyday. Oath keepers, you guys have some good ideas, but you leave Jesus Christ out of the picture. God’s judgment is falling on this Nation.

I agree with you Bobby, and so should every other blood washed Christian that is an oath keeper. Our guns are useless with out God heading up the safety of this country.With Him we may get a less severe judgement. Without Him say goodbye to the country you seem to care about. If you think you can take care of business without Jesus Christ, you are only fooling yourselves.

Military? That’s just plain stupid. Instead, why don’t we exercise some guts & punish the shooters & their helpers? Fair but swift trials, appeals, & certain execution within 60 days. Guarantee that & I’ll guarantee the problem will go from .00001 to .000000000001.

Yes,Rollie, I agree!!!!!! Swift and sure punishment for shooters and their helpers and the democrats who tolerate them and condemn the 2nd Amendment!! No military!! Instead train all teachers and students what to do in an active shooter attack!! Train the teachers in concealed carry, but never force a teacher to carry. Only volunteers. Do it now!!!!!

Most of these mass shooters are bent on suicide and want to go out and get their 15 minutes of fame then they kill themselves or are killed by police. When they carry out these shootings they are not thinking of being executed because they have gone beyond that point and they want to die in their grand plan. So quick trials and executions will not stop this problem. Terrorist don’t care about any death penalty also. Deploy the NG until Trump is able to put a program in place that will protect our schools and also give out of work LEO’s a job that they would be happy to do.

While I applaud your desire to find a solution, I seriously doubt that there are enough National Guardsmen to protect all of the schools in this vast nation. Arming teachers and staff seems to be the only reasonable option (in my opinion). There must be armed protection in every possible location, throughout the school. Armed guards can only be in one place at a time and can not be expected to be able to respond fast enough to protect those in danger.

these murders are happening at a regular pace. Just like they are planed. This is not random but a calculated plan to disarm us. The same people who blew the world trade center, fast and furious, the Oklahoma Federal building, and countless other attacks with drugs and evil deeds against us are behind these mass murders. Trump said he was going to drain the swamp, he has failed and this is the result. The president must stop this buy presidential power and the whole of the armed might of the country. Either he acts or he will be taken out and our republic will end.

Reference to my earlier post I added that the act should be limited to specific length of time of federal involvement. To avoid more federal involvement it would be more appropriate that the state provide assistance to county government in supporting the local militia.
I have noticed that the FBI always gets involved in these types of shootings. With the current school shooting situation taking place in Texas, I ask why is that? Also, it is always taken out of local law enforcement hands. With the recent expose of the top leadership I find it increasingly difficult to trust that federal government department.
To sum it up, keep government involvement as local as possible would seem to me to be the best.

Might work or at least reduce school killings. But I’m afraid federal taxes (or the deficit) will go up along with local school taxes if such a sweeping action were taken. I suspect nut-cases like this will simply go to other places where kids hang out, such as malls and movie theaters.

Over-reaction in the wrong direction. Even if we had the money & military personnel to cover every school, what then? Shouldn’t we cover every daycare, playground, park, church, McDonald’s, Chucky Cheese, et al? School shootings will continue because they work. The next shooter is loading up now. Arming trained teachers is fine. Five or 6 years ago, as a retired police firearms/tactics instructor, I offered the locals 20-25 staggered, donated hours of protection per week. I was brushed off like a sand flea.

The Texas school had armed resource officers assigned. That stopped further killing but did not prevent all. No way can all murder be prevented. Still letting teachers that choose be armed is the best effort to limit how much a killer can do.

According to CDC reports on teenage suicides 4k attempt every year 2k attempts are directly tie to being bullied at school hundreds of thousands refuse to attend school because of kids bullying them School do little to stop harsh penalties and suppensions need to be given to the bullies

As a Veteran, I totally agree with enlisting the National Guard Units to assist in protecting our Schools and Children. However, the bulk of the time, the National Guard is deployed without ammunition! Example; Our Mexican Border. Willie (Above comment) is spot on. Our children are forbidden to get into any form of ‘fight’ aka; “Zero Tolerance”, not even to protect themselves.
Children, as we all know far too well, can be very vicious with their picking and bullying. The victims are basically left hopeless especially when the School Employees ignore their plight. Both the Teachers and Coaches at Santa Fe High School need to be investigated and either made to protect the weaker children/cease THEIR bullying or, be terminated!
While bullying is NO excuse for what happened in Texas, kids of this age are left with NO support what so ever from their parents, teachers, guidance counselors, coaches nor, law enforcement.
Gone are the days where a victim can stand their ground and fight it out with the bullies.
My vote is to employ multiple “Armed Guards”, train and approve school staff members to carry a weapon and, more closely monitor kids behavior and social media comments.
Additionally, with all the individual Militias in every State, perhaps enlist ‘Trained’ volunteers to assist Law Enforcement as well. I would be MORE than willing to donate 1 or 2 days a week to protect our children.

Beyond that, I am deeply disturbed that Stewart Rhodes suggests that the president call out the National Guard when it is the “Militia of the several States” that has the power and therefore the duty “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections, and repel Invasions”.
It is high-time that We the People assume our rightful position, take control of our communities, and work to bring back law and order.

A well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free state..so says the 2nd Amendment. Revitalizing the Constitutional Militia appears to be the best solution since it is a local solution with better vetting and better motivated pool of applicants. The Israel Defense Force is more like a Militia & historically always has been. That is why their intel is the best in the world.Know your enemy.

I agree that the State Militias were the backbone of local security back before WWII. I think each state should reorganize these units again to ensure the peace and security at the local levels. Volunteers trained and equiped by each state, as a quasi military/security unit, to be used by that state for duties such as border security and school public security. They would fall under the command and control of the state Gov and NG Adjutant, Fed Assistance with financial and equipment.

I took the steps, in accordance with my states statutes, to be a part of Militia and to be assigned a rank and duty befitting a veteran. The answer showed that those in positions of delegated authority don’t know the difference between the required Militia, and the voluntary National Guard.
While we certainly could have a voluntary Constitutional Militia today, I would suggest that in the current state of affairs we need to make it mandatory, at least for a period of time.

Sorry, I did not know if my previous post made it or not.
Gentlemen, I see this as a multiple layer issue that needs to be addressed :
1. With a goal and having a projected time frame suggestion 3-5 years
2. Somehow include the Education Dept to benefit from their connections, infrastructure and their funds
3. Put all of the previous events on a spreadsheet and see what simularities there have been
4. Once the spreadsheet is put together and analyzed, prioritize the locations with the highest risk factor First, thereby eliminating the higher risk environments first.
This would include:
A. potential target hardening
B. Supplying needed personnel oath Keepers or whoever)
C. Addressing the Dress codes where possible
D. Having areas at each location set up for two Helo pads for both incoming back up and extraction of injured at each location
E. Having each school responsible for profiling any potential threats regardless of the color/race. Have the profile based on actural issues that were repeatedly found in the spreadsheet.
F. have the Edu8cation Dept allocate $$ to each district based on how much of the issues the districts have successfully addressed.
That is how I would address it.

A [VERY TIME PROVEN EFFECTIVE] old time public neck stretching party for any convicted punk coward murderer who still drew breath after the fact, – combined with the allowance of any on school premise employee who chooses to use his or her hard earned CCW permit, [in a very defined and extremely discrete manner], – along with at least one uniformed police officer, ( the number of LEO’s dependent on the size of the student body and square footage of the school), would drop these CRIMINAL ACTS, (not “TRAGEDIES”), to almost, if not ‘completely,’ non-existent levels; [I’m betting]. Perhaps a provision requiring any CCW carry volunteers to have had their permits for at least three years before being considered by the school boards. Now, let me say here and now, I expect my proposals to be even considered like I expect ANY part of America to return to its Constitutional basis or my hitting the Power Ball tomorrow. What I expect is the traitorous SCUMBAG media to get its way and Constitutional America to fall in line with all the other great nation states that came and fell before her from which the Founding Fathers cherry picked all their best ingredients when creating this [now failing] “last best hope of mankind.” For without the Second Amendment, as the great Charleton Heston warned us, all the other parts of the founding documents become nothing more than “Parchment Promises.”

We have one Resource officer in our system,( the best ) but there are several schools to deal with. I am a former LEO, and a Special Forces Solider . I would gladly provide a service such as this for our students and staff. I teach Active shooter classes as well as trauma classes after the shooting has occurred. I have a private range and all I do is free. I have been told in Idaho it legal already for teachers to do this. I need to confirm this. I am on the Security team at my church. At first, some did not think it was necessary, but now they are glad we are here.

The lesson here to school kids and others as well, is if you are mean and cruel to others, you risk retaliation. Period.
As for arming, it’s our right to be armed. If you fear your children are at risk, keep them home or send them to a private school. When a large enough portion of students are not showing up, the school districts might have brains enough to eliminate the gun free fiasco which is nothing more than part of the disarm us agenda.
The point is, parents need to take action, not rely on government baby sitters, i.e. the tax payers.

It is past time that we as Patriotic Americans step in to help the President and our children. There are many veterans in this country that will gladly donate our time to protect our children while they are at school. The “gun free zones” have to go, they are an open advertisement to criminals. People need to realize that criminals do not pay attention to laws. The existing gun laws that we have need to be strictly enforced and dealt with by judges that will uphold the laws and deal out stiff sentences that will get these people off of the streets. Mental illness awareness needs to be addressed immediately also. The bullying situation also needs to be addressed, it is proven to be a common denominator in the recent shootings that have happened. These situations did not happen when I was in school, where did we go wrong? Parents have quit parenting, we sat back while God was taken out of schools, parents do not teach respect anymore, video games and cell phones are the only parenting that a lot of today’s children get. This can be taken care of but we have a long way to go to get back to where we used to be. The excuse I hear is “times have changed” yes they have but not for the better. Parents need to start parenting again, teach respect, teach to love each other instead of bullying the outcast children. The ones that feel like they are outcast need to know they are loved also. Let them know that they can get help, do not make them feel like it is a lost cause to talk about their problems. A problem to them might not be a problem to someone else but all should be able to talk about what ever is bothering them. May God watch over all of us and be with the ones that feel lost. We are all God’s children.

May I point out Mr. Rhodes that National Guard are always in federal service since they are “Troops *** of War” that the states keep by the “Consent of Congress” under Article 1, Section 8, Cls. 3, and actually a part of the army.
It disturb’s me that you have not pointed to the fact that “The president shall be Commander and Chief of the *** Militia of the several States”, which would be the proper course of action “to execute the Laws of the Union” under Article 1, Section 8, Cls. 15, and thereby make it mandatory for the Congress “To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia” under Cls. 16.

I’m certainly should not have presumed that the people here would have the courage to describe Militia as it was meant to be, and not skirt the issue as if they are the lap dogs of “Mothers Demand Action, or Everytown”.

What we need to do is to hire retired police/military personal and train some teachers to protect our kids.

We need to VOTE in mass in 2018 and 2020 to stop the Dems from blocking our attempts to protect our children.

Eventually armed staff speed throughout the campus carrying concealed will have the least impact on daily school life for the sensitive little anti-gun individuals. It must be done soon.

Final legal clash between cryptocurrency exchanges, India’s central bank begins
Home » News » Final legal clash between cryptocurrency exchanges, India’s central bank begins	
News
September 11, 2018 by Raja Shekar	
The long-awaited day for India’s top most court to determine the future of cryptocurrency exchanges in the nation has gotten here. The end result of the last hearing arranged on Tuesday concerning the fate of cryptocurrency trading platforms will place an end to raising unpredictability experienced by these exchanges.
Inception of the war
The clash between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and also crypto exchanges started when the reserve bank restricted banks from offering services to companies dealing with cryptocurrencies. Inning accordance with its regulation, financial institutions and banks were needed to terminate all professional connections with such exchanges in India.
Adhering to the action, local exchanges combined and approached the nation’s leading court to seek remedy for such stringent policies. However, the Supreme Court of India did not grant a stay on the RBI regulation.
So why did RBI take on such a harsh position? For RBI, the protection of its clients and also capitalists comes first. It thinks that financiers are extremely vulnerable to cryptocurrency rip-offs when taking care of cryptocurrency firms and exchanges
The stand taken by the reserve bank has actually lined up with the Indian federal government, which has actually compared cryptocurrency frauds to ponzi plans. Concerns regarding crypto-based services obtaining involved in prohibited activities such as loan laundering and also horror funding have additionally been increased.
Situation made by regional crypto exchanges.
Nonetheless, local crypto exchanges have actually emphatically opposed RBI’s step by describing Article 19 (1) (g) of the Indian constitution. The short article states that all Indian citizens deserve to carry out any kind of company, trading activity and line of work.
The exchanges are willing to accept guidelines and analysis from regulative bodies. However, they oppose a total ban on their organisation given that frauds can take place at any kind of place and also with any type of line of work which takes care of huge amounts of loan as well as financial investments.
Raja Shekar
A mechanical engineer turned journalist, Shekar takes a keen interest in the study and analysis of cryptocurrencies and blockchain strategy. With the cryptocurrency world blooming in the recent days, he finds great interest in monitoring their growth and gathering every possible piece of information about them. He works as a crypto-journalist for the website Peopleperbitcoin.

About This Data
Prescribing data from Medicare’s prescription drug benefit, known as Part D, was compiled and released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees the program. The data for 2016 includes more than 1.5 billion prescriptions written by 1.1 million doctors, nurses and other providers. This database lists over 460,000 of those providers who wrote 50 or more prescriptions for at least one drug that year. More than three-fourths of these prescriptions went to patients 65 and older; the rest were for disabled patients. Methodology »
Incorrect Info?
If you are a provider and you believe your address is incorrect, check the listing you created on the National Provider Identifier registry. If you change your listing, send a note to [email protected] and we will update your information. If you have other questions about this data, send a note to [email protected].
Caveats
No comparisons are shown if there are fewer than 20 prescribers in the state share this specialty.
Comparisons do not take into account the medical conditions of patients. Medications for certain conditions do not have generic alternatives, so patients would receive more expensive brand name drugs.
This provider's address and specialty information was last updated on May 1, 2017.
Comparisons are based on each provider’s current address, not necessarily where he or she worked during the time period covered in this database.
In rare circumstances, providers' prescription tallies may be inflated. Sometimes providers are credited with prescriptions written by colleagues (this happens in long-term care facilities) or are victims of fraud involving theft of their provider number.

The products featured in this story are independently selected by Robb Report editors. However, we may earn an affiliate commission when you buy something through our retail links.
Though we’ve been feeding you first-rate holiday gift ideas all month long (hopefully you’ve already booked that once-in-a-lifetime Great Wall of China dinner for your resident jet-setter), there are likely still a few people on your list you haven’t hit yet. So, with holiday-shopping procrastinators in mind, we tapped the experts over at Mr Porter to make things easy on us. Here, we break down the e-tailer’s top 10 picks for the season—ranging from classic pajamas to whimsical cufflinks. The best part? There’s still plenty of time to ensure they’ll arrive in time to be under the tree on Christmas morning.
Common Projects Achilles Sneakers
You can’t go wrong with a pair of Common Projects Achilles leather sneakers ($410). The sleek, minimal style will slot into just about anyone’s wardrobe—pairing as easily with laid-back jeans on the weekend as they do sharp trousers at the office. Though we’re willing to bet that your intended could use a fresh pair of white kicks, the style also comes in a rainbow of different leather colors should you want to go for something a little bit out of the box.
Common Projects Sneakers Courtesy of Mr Porter
Brunello Cucinelli Cashmere Cardigan
Cardigans that are sharp enough to double as blazers proved to be a wardrobe essential this year, and Brunello Cucinelli’s cashmere number ($2,755) is one of the best takes on the market. The cozy sweater features a softly tailored shape—complete with notch lapels and three rich tortoiseshell buttons—making it perfect for days when you (or that lucky person on your list) aren’t willing to forgo an ounce of comfort while at the office.

Asprey Cocktail Shaker
This year, skip the cliched candles and fragrances, and gift the man-who-has-everything on your list a slick cocktail shaker. This playful racing car sterling sliver and enamel shaker ($13,500) will make for an indulgent addition to most bar carts, and is something we are sure he won’t already have stashed in his collection. Now, you’ll just need to convince him to whisk you up a sure speakeasy-worthy tipple (or two).

Begg & Co Cashmere Scarf
Unlike candles and fragrances, scarves are one of those go-to gifts that are guaranteed to be crowd pleasers. Scottish brand Begg & Co have been fine tuning the cozy accessory since 1866—and this Arran fringed cashmere style ($425) is exactly the kind of thing it does best. Its deep navy-and-grey colorway is neutral enough to slot seamlessly into the wardrobe of the person who unwraps it on Christmas Day, but is just a little bit more interesting than basic black.

Desmond & Dempsey Pajama Shirt
This year, kick your Christmas pajama tradition up a notch by swapping out the patterned flannel for a plush style your intended will be able to wear year-round. This brushed cotton-twill pajama shirt ($135) from Desmond & Dempsey fits just this bill: It’s substantial enough to keep them warm in the winter, but not to heavy to carry over into spring and fall. And with its careful white piping and mother-of-pearl buttons, downtime never looked so good.

Le Labo Toiletries
We admit it: a toiletry set is not exactly the sexiest gift you can give during the holidays. That said, we think anyone would be thrilled to add Le Labo’s Hinoki Body & Hair set ($55) to their travel bag. The four piece set includes everything you need to keep looking and feeling fresh—and is an easy way to introduce the Parisian brand’s decadent fragrances to that man on your list who’s still partial to drug-store body sprays.

Mr P. Cable Knit Sweater
Mr P., the in-house line launched by Mr Porter earlier this year, has quickly made a name for itself by turning out one collection of near-perfect basics after the next. This cherry-red merino wool and cashmere-blend sweater ($375) is no exception—it’s got a slim fit that keeps its cable-knit construction feeling modern, and its vivid hue is sure to provide a boost of energy on those dreary post-holiday days.

Filson Duffle Bag
A sharp carry-on bag is sure to be a winner with everyone from the jet-setter to the constantly on-the-move CEO on your list. This duffle ($395) from Filson is an expert mix of form and function—combining hard-wearing navy twill with equestrian inspired (and strength) leather straps and handles. Its classic look will only get better as your intended puts in lap after lap around the globs.

Deakin & Francis Cufflinks
When you get it right, a pair of cufflinks is the kind of gift that can be passed down for generations (and we’re not talking about dreaded re-gifting here). Case in point? These whimsical 18-karat gold cufflinks ($5,595) from Deakin & Francis. Though they certainly don’t play it safe, the frog shaped design—complete with glistening emerald eyes—is small enough to make a subtle, timeless statement when paired with a crisp dress shirt and expertly-cut tuxedo.

Smythson Games Compendium
When it comes to something the whole family can enjoy, this clever games compendium ($3,395) from Smythson is a serious treat. The full-grain leather box holds everything you’d need for a round of chess, checkers, and dominos—and when you’re not in the middle of a high-stakes tournament, its blue-and-black nubuck top is sure to sit pretty on nearly anyone’s coffee table.

As noted above, hemp seed cake makes an excellent feed for animals. However, feeding entire plants is another matter, because the leaves are covered with the resin-producing glands. While deer, groundhogs, rabbits, and other mammals will nibble on hemp plants, mammals generally do not choose to eat hemp. Jain and Arora (1988) fed narcotic Cannabis refuse to cattle, and found that the animals “suffered variable degrees of depression and revealed incoordination in movement.” By contrast, Letniak et al. (2000) conducted an experimental trial of hemp as silage. No significant differences were found between yield of the hemp and of barley/oat silage fed to heifers, suggesting that fermenting hemp plants reduces possible harmful constituents.
Earliest reference to euphoric use of C. sativa appears to date to China of 5 millennia ago, but it was in India over the last millennium that drug consumption became more firmly entrenched than anywhere else in the world. Not surprisingly, the most highly domesticated drug strains were selected in India. While C. sativa has been used as a euphoriant in India, the Near East, parts of Africa, and other Old World areas for thousands of years, such use simply did not develop in temperate countries where hemp was raised. The use of C. sativa as a recreational inebriant in sophisticated, largely urban settings is substantially a 20th century phenomenon.
Regarding health claims, the contract states: “Under no circumstances may [a distributor] prescribe any Product as suitable for a particular ailment. No claims may be made as to therapeutic or curative properties of any Product offered by the Company.” As for income claims, the contract says distributors are “prohibited from making false, misleading, or unrepresentative claims regarding earning potential.” It adds that, when an income claim reflects actual earnings, the claim must be accompanied by “the Company’s current Annual Average Income Disclosure, posted on the Company’s website.” But as of the date of publication, it was not posted there.
At sufficient doses (400-600 mg), CBD can alleviate situational anxiety, such as public speaking. Interestingly, cannabis cultivars, or strains, that are high in CBD and low in THC are better than other cultivars for alleviating depression. But when used over a long period of time, any kind of cannabis could make depression worse. Although clinical trials in people haven’t yet been completed, there is very compelling “petri dish” evidence that CBD can reduce inflammation, for painful conditions such as Crohn’s disease, and fight some cancerous tumors. There is a massive amount of scientific research being done on CBD right now, and we are likely to see many medical breakthroughs in the next decade.
Fiberboard. In North America the use of nonwood fibers in sheet fiberboard (“pressboard” or “composite board”) products is relatively undeveloped. Flax, jute, kenaf, hemp, and wheat straw can be used to make composite board. Wheat straw is the dominant nonwood fiber in such applications. Although it might seem that hemp bast fibers are desirable in composite wood products because of their length and strength, in fact the short fibers of the hurds have been found to produce a superior product (K. Domier, pers. commun.). Experimental production of hemp fiberboard has produced extremely strong material (Fig. 22). The economic viability of such remains to be tested. Molded fiberboard products are commercially viable in Europe (Fig. 23), but their potential in North America remains to be determined.

What is the size of your dog? Hempworx is only .3% THC and that is ranked safe for pets and humans. Sounds to me like you gave your dog an overdose by how much you gave him. Sounds like you may have given him more than 20 drops each time , no wonder he got sick. Your Affliate should have gave you a dosage amount list for the weight of your dog. The symptoms you discribed are from an overdose of THC .
As part of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, or the 2018 Farm Bill, signed by Republican President Donald Trump, the Hemp Farming Act of 2018 removed hemp (with less than 0.3% THC) from Schedule I, the most restrictive classification of controlled substances that are considered highly prone to abuse and not to have any medicinal benefit. This move allowed for cultivation and distribution of hemp as a legal agricultural product. Under the Hemp Farming Act, hemp cultivation is no longer limited to state departments and universities. In addition, the act allows hemp farmers rights to water, crop insurance, and federal agricultural grants, as well as legal access to national banking. Hemp may also be transported across state lines.
I started taking Hempworx CBD Oil, it’s been a #gamechanger, it has reduced my blood pressure to normal, I had readings in the stroke level but blood pressure pills even the mildest ones bottomed it out! Now I’m staying normal ranges and I’m also diabetic my sugar is consistently normal. It’s amazing me’ my legs were swollen so bad within a week they went down! This is the best stuff ever!!
A 2012 review found that the THC content in marijuana had increased worldwide from 1970 to 2009.[160] It is unclear, however, whether the increase in THC content has caused people to consume more THC or if users adjust based on the potency of the cannabis. It is likely that the higher THC content allows people to ingest less tar. At the same time, CBD levels in seized samples have lowered, in part because of the desire to produce higher THC levels and because more illegal growers cultivate indoors using artificial lights. This helps avoid detection but reduces the CBD production of the plant.[161]
This cannabinoid is known as cannabidiol (CBD) and is the second most abundant cannabinoid found in cannabis on the market today. Research performed by G.W. Pharmaceuticals suggests that CBD could be used for treating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, diabetes, nausea, bowel disorders, and many other hard-to-control side effects. According to an research by Project CBD, CBD has even demonstrated neuroprotective effects, and its anti-cancer potential is currently being explored.
Along with its better-known counterpart, THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the chemical that produces the marijuana high), CBD is one of more than 400 compounds found in the oils of cannabis plant species, which include marijuana and hemp. Unlike THC, CBD will not make you high. That said, this doesn’t mean CBD is not at all psychoactive, as many assert, says Jahan Marcu, Ph.D., director of experimental pharmacology and behavior at the International Research Center on Cannabis and Mental Health in New York City: “CBD does change cognition. It affects mood, which is why people take it for anxiety. And some find that it makes them more alert.”
Hemp isn’t completely absent of psychoactive compounds, but that doesn’t mean it will get you high. Hemp plants simply don’t produce enough THC to have an intoxicating effect. CBD, though psychoactive, is a non-intoxicating cannabinoid and won’t produce any form of a euphoric high on its own. In other words, hemp has plenty of therapeutic potential, but you’ll have to look elsewhere if you want to get high.
During the period from 1937 to the late 60s, the U.S. government understood and acknowledged that industrial hemp and marijuana were distinct varieties of the Cannabis plant. Hemp was no longer officially recognized as distinct from marijuana after the passage of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970. This is despite the fact that a specific exemption for hemp was included in the CSA under the definition of marijuana. The recent federal court case HIA vs DEA has re-established acknowledgement of distinct varieties of Cannabis, and supports the exemption for non-viable seed and fiber and any products made from them.
Finally, the entire marijuana flower structure is coated with resinous crystals called trichomes. Trichomes are translucent, mushroom-like glands that form on the entire flowering structure and even the stems of the marijuana plant. These bulb-shaped glands secrete the rich, aromatic essential oils that give cannabis its smells and flavors. Trichomes also contain cannabinoids.
Born in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, we’ve been growing some of the safest and most thoroughly tested medical cannabis on the market since 2016. Our state-of-the-art facility in Cremona, Alberta, was specifically designed to keep our plants happy, and alongside a meticulous process of harvesting and curing we ensure only the best product arrives at your door.
It is not surprising that male-associated markers are relatively abundant. In dioecious plants where sex chromosomes have not been identified, markers for maleness indicate either the presence of sex chromosomes which have not been distinguished by cytological methods or that the marker is tightly linked to a gene involved in sex determination.[15]
Smaller companies focused on CBD beverages, such as New Age Beverages Corp. NBEV, -0.73% , have been targeted by investors, but some firms have used CBD-related announcements to pump stock prices as well as fuel excitement in a compound that scientists do not fully understand. Other companies operating in the sector will benefit too: Charlotte’s Web Holdings Inc. CWBHF, +2.07% has focused on a range of CBD products, capturing about 17% market share in 2017 with sales in 3,000 retail locations, according to PI Financial research.
exhaustion and pain that kept her on the couch much of the day. The 58-year-old Seattle speech coach didn’t want to take opioid pain-killers, but Tylenol wasn’t helping enough. Roth was intrigued when women in her online chat group enthused about a cannabis-derived oil called cannabidiol (CBD) that they said relieved pain without making them high. So Roth, who hadn’t smoked weed since college but lived in a state where cannabis was legal, walked into a dispensary and bought a CBD tincture. “Within a few hours of placing the drops in my mouth, the malaise and achiness that had plagued me for weeks lifted and became much more manageable,” she says. She took the drops several times a day and in a few weeks was back to her regular life.
Until very recently, the most convincing evidence that cannabis use precipitates schizophrenia came from a 15-year prospective study of cannabis use and schizophrenia in 50 465 Swedish conscripts (Andreasson et al., 1987). This study investigated the relationship between self-reported cannabis use at age 18 and the risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia in the Swedish psychiatric case register during the next 15 years. Andreasson and colleagues found a dose–response relationship between the risk of schizophrenia and the number of times cannabis had been used by age 18 (1.3 times higher for those who had used cannabis 1–10 times, 3 times higher for those who had used cannabis 1–50 times, and 6 times higher for those who had used cannabis more than 50 times). These risks were reduced after statistical adjustment for potentially confounding variables (a psychiatric diagnosis at age 18, and parental divorce), but the relationships remained statistically significant.
With respect to fiber, a “composite” is often defined as a material consisting of 30%–70% fiber and 70%–30% matrix (Bolton 1995). However, in North America particleboards and fiberboards, which generally contain less than 10% adhesive or matrix, are sometimes referred to as composites. This section addresses plastic-type composites. In plastics, fibers are introduced to improve physical properties such as stiffness, impact resistance, bending and tensile strength. Man-made fibers of glass, kevlar and carbon are most commonly used today, but plant fibers offer considerable cost savings along with comparable strength properties.
Canadian experience with growing hemp commercially for the last 4 years has convinced many growers that it is better to use a single-purpose cultivar, seed or fiber, than a dual-purpose cultivar. The recent focus of Canadian hemp breeders has been to develop cultivars with high seed yields, low stature (to avoid channeling the plants’ energy into stalk, as is the case in fiber cultivars), early maturation (for the short growing seasons of Canada), and desirable fatty acid spectrum (especially gamma-linolenic acid).
A panellized system of hemp-lime panels for use in building construction is currently under test in a European Union-funded research collaboration led by the University of Bath. The panels are being designed to assure high-quality construction, rapid on-site erection, optimal hygrothermal performance from day one, and energy- and resource-efficient buildings. The 36-month-long work programme aims to refine product and manufacturing protocols, produce data for certification and marketing, warranty, insurance cover, and availability of finance. It also includes the development of markets in Britain, France, and Spain.[35]
CBD(Cannabidiol) is a cannabis compound that has significant medical benefits, but does not make people feel “high”. The fact that CBD-rich cannabis is non-psychoactive (as opposed to a THC dominant strain) makes it an appealing option for patients looking for relief from inflammation, pain, psychosis, seizures, spasms, and many other conditions without feelings of lethargy or dysphoria. Hemp Worx 750 is CBD dominant oil!
It is clear that there is a culture of idealistic believers in hemp in North America, and that there is great determination to establish the industry. As history has demonstrated, unbridled enthusiasm for largely untested new crops touted as gold mines sometimes leads to disaster. The attempt to raise silk in the US is probably the most egregious example. In 1826 a Congressional report that recommended the preparation of a practical manual on the industry resulted in a contagious desire to plant mulberries for silk production, with the eventual collapse of the industry, the loss of fortunes, and a legacy of “Mulberry Streets” in the US (Chapter 2, Bailey 1898). In the early 1980s in Minnesota, Jerusalem artichoke was touted as a fuel, a feed, a food, and a sugar crop. Unfortunately there was no market for the new “wonder crop” and hundreds of farmers lost about $20 million (Paarlberg 1990). The level of “hype” associated with industrial hemp is far more than has been observed before for other new crops (Pinfold Consulting 1998). Probably more so than any plant in living memory, hemp attracts people to attempt its cultivation without first acquiring a realistic appreciation of the possible pitfalls. American presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson encouraged the cultivation of hemp, but both lost money trying to grow it. Sadly in Canada in 1999 numerous farmers contracted to grow half of Canada’s crop area for hemp for the American-based Consolidated Growers and Processors, and with the collapse of the firm were left holding very large amounts of unmarketable grain and baled hemp straw. This has represented a most untimely setback for a fledgling industry, but at least has had a sobering effect on investing in hemp. In this section we emphasize why producers should exercise caution before getting into hemp.
Cannabinoids, terpenoids, and other compounds are secreted by glandular trichomes that occur most abundantly on the floral calyxes and bracts of female plants.[42] As a drug it usually comes in the form of dried flower buds (marijuana), resin (hashish), or various extracts collectively known as hashish oil.[8] In the early 20th century, it became illegal in most of the world to cultivate or possess Cannabis for sale or personal use.
The dosage on the back label said to give him 1/2 to a full dropper twice a day due to his weight. I gave him 1/2 a dropper with his food. A few hours later I noticed he was wobbling when he walked and tripped up the stairs and collapsed. I took him to my vet and he said there must be THC in the oil. I thought, how can a company sell this product knowing full well that THC is extremely TOXIC for animals! The rep I bought the vials from said I gave him too much and to follow the dosage chart she gave me. Why would I give him anymore of this poison to my dog? Also, why did the product sold to me not have the proper dosage label? Also, I found that this product is Full Spectrum which means there is THC in the product.
Focusing more on lifestyle issues and their relationships with functional health, data from the Alameda County Study suggested that people can improve their health via exercise, enough sleep, maintaining a healthy body weight, limiting alcohol use, and avoiding smoking.[27] Health and illness can co-exist, as even people with multiple chronic diseases or terminal illnesses can consider themselves healthy.[28]
Does anybody know about cbd vs thc for chronic exhaustion? There are times that I can barely get out of bed and can’t do work due to it, and it has gotten my mood swings to go over the roof! I don’t have much interest in doing just thc because it makes me feel more lethargic, but cbd has seem to be able to help me! I need to know if someone has used it for this problem, and is results
A 2015 review found that the use of high CBD-to-THC strains of cannabis showed significantly fewer positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, better cognitive function and both lower risk for developing psychosis, as well as a later age of onset of the illness, compared to cannabis with low CBD-to-THC ratios.[279] A 2014 Cochrane review found that research was insufficient to determine the safety and efficacy to using cannabis to treat schizophrenia or psychosis.[280] As of 2017, the molecular mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory and possible pain relieving effects of cannabis are under preliminary research.[281]
In addition to acting on the brain, CBD influences many body processes. That’s due to the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which was discovered in the 1990s, after scientists started investigating why pot produces a high. Although much less well-known than the cardiovascular, reproductive, and respiratory systems, the ECS is critical. “The ECS helps us eat, sleep, relax, forget what we don’t need to remember, and protect our bodies from harm,” Marcu says. There are more ECS receptors in the brain than there are for opioids or serotonin, plus others in the intestines, liver, pancreas, ovaries, bone cells, and elsewhere.
In addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer.[61][62] Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.

Proust Was a Neuroscientist
By Jonah Lehrer
Synopsis: In this technology-driven age, it’s tempting to believe that science can solve every mystery. After all, science has cured countless diseases and even sent humans into space. But as Jonah Lehrer argues in this sparkling debut, science is not the only path to knowledge. In fact, when it comes to understanding the brain, art got there first.
Taking a group of artists — a painter, a poet, a chef, a composer, and a handful of novelists — Lehrer shows how each one discovered an essential truth about the mind that science is only now rediscovering. We learn, for example, how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory; how George Eliot discovered the brain’s malleability; how the French chef Escoffier discovered umami (the fifth taste); how Cézanne worked out the subtleties of vision; and how Gertrude Stein exposed the deep structure of language — a full half-century before the work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists. It’s the ultimate tale of art trumping science.
More broadly, Lehrer shows that there’s a cost to reducing everything to atoms and acronyms and genes. Measurement is not the same as understanding, and art knows this better than science does. An ingenious blend of biography, criticism, and first-rate science writing, Proust Was a Neuroscientist urges science and art to listen more closely to each other, for willing minds can combine the best of both, to brilliant effect.

The United States has provided the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) operating in Syria man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) within the framework of the secret agreement, media reported.
The Al-Masdar News media outlet reported Monday citing own sources that the US had provided the MANPADS to the Kurds earlier in the month under the agreement between Washington and the YPG. According to the news outlet, the MANPADS have been delivered to the Kurds in the northwestern part of Syria near the town of Afrin.

US Plans For Border Security Force in Syria May Spawn Separatist Movement
On Saturday, the Defense Post news website published an article, in which the spokesman of the US-led coalition fighting against the Daesh terrorist group said that the coalition was engaged in training of a 30,000-strong force on the territory within Syria currently controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia to maintain security in controlled area along the Syrian border.
The reports about the new US initiative have arisen against the backdrop of a statement made by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday. According to Erdogan, the Turkish army may launch an operation in the northwestern Syrian regions of Manbij and Afrin controlled by the Kurdish militias within a week. The Turkish leader also expressed hope that Washington would back Ankara's efforts.

Keep Your Stamps From Falling Off Clear Blocks!
Announcements/ Paper crafting
Happy New Year Stampers! I'm here today with some exciting news! I'm going to share how to keep your stamps from falling off clear blocks. The solution…CLING stamps!
I'm sure you've experienced the same thing I have, when I've inked up a stamp and then just before stamping on the paper…poof…off falls the stamp and lands on the paper in an unplanned spot! This is so frustrating, right? Well, I've got some great news for you!
With the release of Stampin' Up!'s Occasions Catalog comes the release of our NEW Cling Stamps. These new stamps were tested in our Japan market and I've also had the chance to use them for about a month. They truly are a game changer!
Please watch this short video so you can see why I'm so excited to share this news:
Awesome, right? Our classic red rubber stamps are now better than ever! They are the same high quality rubber material you've always loved but now they come with an adhesive image label that will cling like crazy to your clear blocks (annual catalog page e206) OR Stamparatus clear plates (annual catalog page 207) each and every time you use them!
From now on, our stamps will either be “cling” or photopolymer; our large background stamps will also come with a wood option.
You can check out all the new stamp sets in the occasions catalog at my online store OR open any of our catalogs by clicking on the sidebar here on my blog.

Hey Stampers! A friend of mine posted this picture on Facebook yesterday and I had to share it!
Usually, I'm very sad at the end of the weekend. There just never seems to be enough time to get everything done! Can you relate?

I would jump on this right away, as once the supply of kits allocated to this promotion is gone, the sale will end. Click here to get yours before they're all gone and BE SURE TO ENTER THE CODE FLASH1018 before you checkout in the box “prepaid or promo code”. If you don't enter this code, you won't get the special $5.00 price.

Take Your Pick Tool by Stampin’ Up!
Announcements/ Product Information
Hello Stampers! I hope you all had a relaxing “Labor Day”; kind of seems like it should be “Un-Labor Day” instead! 🙂 I got to spend most of the weekend stamping and planning projects for my upcoming events. Of course, that meant I was playing with all sorts of new products, like our new Take Your Pick Tool!
Every so often, Stampin' Up! comes up with a tool that is a game changer. We demonstrators have been asking for this sort of tool for awhile and now we've got it!
The last “game changer” type (in my humble opinion) was the stamp positioning tool, the Stamparatus. It made two, three, and four step stamping SO easy for my customers. If you're not familiar with that tool, I'll have a video farther down in this post where you can check it out. But, back to the Take Your Pick Tool.
This little gem is designed to make working with small embellishments so much easier. The “putty” end is perfect for picking up sequins and placing them perfectly on your projects. The flat, spatula is designed to easily slip under adhesive backed elements such as rhinestones, pearls and enamel dots. There is also a paper piercing tool AND two sizes of stylus tips. Seriously, this is A-MAAAA-ZING! I grabbed a video done by one of our product specialists in the home office. Check it out:
You can order this tool starting tomorrow at my online store.
And…here's a quick video about the Stamparatus!
Remember, our Holiday Catalog goes live tomorrow and you can see it online at my store. IF you need your own copy so you can look at all the fabulous new products no matter WHERE you are, just email me! Iif you aren't currently working with another awesome demonstrator, of course!)

New Dem Talking Point: Wall Is *Luxury* We Can’t Afford

It’s so hard to keep up with the Dems: from “illegal immigration is wrong,” to “they aren’t illegal, just undocumented,” to “there’s a crisis at the border” to “the so-called crisis is a manufactured one,” to “border walls are ineffective,” to “border walls are immoral,” and now this, from Pelosi:

We have “no money to secure our borders,” but here’s a list, courtesy of @CalebHull, of things we apparently do have money to spend on.
My personal favs, because…zoos, artwork, Idaho caviar, rabbits getting Swedish massages. And who doesn’t love a good fruit costume?
$1,000,000 on Zoo Poetry: “increasing environmental awareness” by creating poetry in four different zoos
$300,000 to encourage Americans to consume caviar made in Idaho
$4,900,000 to dress students up in fruit costumes and encourage them to eat healthy
$6.3M for VA facility in California to buy artwork
$387,000 studying the effect of Swedish massages on rabbits
HT Twitchy.
THREAD:
Dems are refusing to fund the border wall, so I thought I'd create a list of all the insane things government DOES FUND.

Ted Cruz won’t rule out ending the legislative filibuster
Posted by deacon303 on April 10, 2017

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declined to say Thursday whether he would support the elimination of the legislative filibuster, just moments after Senate Republicans invoked the “nuclear option” to end debate on Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court by lowering the cloture threshold from 60 to 51 votes.Cruz said that while there is not a majority to change the legislative filibuster rules, it could change if Democrats continue to block President Trump’s agenda.
“At this point, there is not a majority for ending the legislative filibuster,” Cruz said. “My hope is that Democrats will stop their unreasonable across-the-board obstruction and allow the Senate to operate. If they continue an unmovable blockade, I suspect the votes will shift on that question as well.”
When pressed a second time if he supports the move, he declined to say.
“Let’s wait and see how the facts develop,” Cruz said.
“I hope there will be continuing conversations of how we can… preserve the legislative cloture requirement, which is something that on a bipartisan basis everybody agrees to,” Cornyn said.

Notions Of Cool V.022
A random list of things and shower thoughts that an old Gen X dude finds cool or worth pondering.
The American middle class is shrinking… but it’s because more people are moving to upper income levels, not dropping down. This is not what we’re being told (and not what I thought). The point of this is that you always need to be thinking like a contrarian. The narrative pushed in the media is not always true. Being a skeptic is good.
Speaking of media narratives… clearly these “journalists” failed to do even the most basic research when they declared the recent flooding as due to, wait for it, climate change! Unfortunately that region floods and has been doing so forever. But it’s different this time I suppose.
Here’s a cool animation of the worlds most populous cities by year from 1500 to 2018.
I went to the golf driving range yesterday. It went about as expected. Which means poorly. I came home and was in the process of scheduling a lesson when I stopped. I realized that of the 47 different hobbies I have, golf is not important enough to me to invest more time in. I’ll continue to play from time to time, but I no longer care. I’ll go flail about and enjoy the company and walk. A good decision I think.
A hobby I do care about is photography. I did an hour walk downtown to grab some photos. I got absolute crap because I wasn’t focused and didn’t pay attention to what I was doing. I will be renewing my efforts to learn and get better. What I can’t decide is sharing my work – do I post the good the bad and the ugly or just the occasional few I really like?
For the most part the media is unable to admit they were wrong about the Mueller investigation. They continue to double down. One of the best examples is chief Trump obsessed former republican morning host Joe Scarborough. The title of this mornings column is “The Mueller war is over – and President Trump won”. That is also the first sentence of his column. Literally the second sentence and every remaining paragraph is dedicated to declaring how horrible Trump is. Good grief. I don’t like Trump, but at this point I’ll vote for him just because I like seeing these pompous media asses get kicked in the teeth.
I made a bold move yesterday and decided to go minimal with my wallet. I rarely carry cash and wanted something that would fit in my front pocket. Ordered one of these. Stay tuned for a review.
Having hit my weight goal, I now need to decide if I’m going to continue down the keto road, or transition to a paleo-ish low glycemic way of eating? I don’t know yet. Part of me wants to continue keto for a while longer and then check my blood markers. Curious if this has impacted my triglycerides? The other part of me wants nachos.

A random list of things and shower thoughts that an old Gen X dude finds cool or worth pondering.
It’s hard not to laugh a little after the Mueller report release. But, as I said before – if you find yourself disappointed, or was hoping this was going to “take down” this president… you are part of the problem. Are you really more interested in allegiance to your tribe than the overall interest of the country? In two years we have another popularity contest and you can vote for the sock puppet of your choice. Until then, let’s try to keep our economy moving forward. Deal?
Speaking of sock puppets, if the democrats 2020 entire message is going to be the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, and Trump is evil… they’re going to lose.
This is an interesting look at an issue with the Tesla autopilot. I’m a big believer in autonomous vehicles… but we’re still in the beginning stages. It shouldn’t be shocking that there’s problems. As a former software test guy, I’m fascinated at what must be an unbelievably complex test environment for the Tesla software.
Yesterday we struggled to get a urine sample from a patient. When we had success I sent it down to the lab. Who then called me to tell me they threw it away. Why? Because I wrote “UA” (for urinalysis) on the label instead of “UCC” (for urine clean catch). Bureaucracy and mindless process drives me insane.
I listened to a podcast that had two really smart people with a bunch of letters behind their names debate the cause of obesity. Is it hormone driven metabolism and storage triggered by sugar or is it genetic driven by the brain? The discussion went way into the weeds and devolved into name calling and utter dismissal of the research papers the other guy cited. The entire time I had two thoughts. First, this is what science is – have an idea, do an experiment to prove it, and let your peers try to disprove it. Second, it’s interesting and not surprising that two very smart guys have widely differing opinions on an extremely complex subject – both backed by oodles of research. This almost sounds like… oh, I don’t know… climate research?
Cloud kitchens partnered with some sort of Uber model are going to be a huge deal.
It’s time to start playing golf again. I spent most of last summer vowing to quit this evil game. I really wish I didn’t enjoy golf, because I hate it so often. I’m generally pretty good at every sport I’ve done – except golf. For the life of me I cannot hit that goddam little white ball. Maybe this will be the season…

A random list of things and shower thoughts that an old Gen X dude finds cool or worth pondering.
The Mueller report dropped. As of this moment we know nothing other than the AG has it. The alphabet channels on all sides of the spectrum are in overdrive spinning and speculating. My thought? I don’t care which side of the aisle you’re on – you should be relieved if there’s nothing in the report. Why? Because it’s bad for country if there is. It would impact the markets, economy, etc… If you’ve been hoping and wishing for some bombshell finding, then you’re part of the problem. Do you really want a president Pence if you’re on the left?
The real problem this country faces, and always has been, is China. China will take over as the dominate superpower at some point.
I suck at any sort of construction. It doesn’t stop me from trying, but I clearly missed this part of woodshop class. Remember when we actually had wood, metal, and auto shop in high school? Anyway, I manage to strip most screws I attempt to put in or remove. Sigh…
A new route up Everest? A cool episode 1 video. Yes, I’ll be watching this one.
We managed to find a guy. A handyman. A laborer. Everyone needs a guy who you trust. This guy is from Peru. Came here knowing zero English and started out as a dishwasher. He’d eat scraps from peoples plates while working because he didn’t know how to order something from the kitchen. This guy works his ass off. We are very soft in this country.
I’m struggling with the bullet journal. I suppose it’s like any habit. I started out strong, then days go by and when you go back to it… it seems silly to write down things that you already know. Right now it feels forced to write stuff in it. I’ll keep at it. Maybe my thoughts will change.
Speaking of writing, I wonder if people like the list form of thoughts vs. a single blog topic? Ultimately I’m doing this for me and I enjoy this more, but I am curious though?
No new Instagram stories. Maybe this week. I might drift back to the Facebook. We’ll see.

Your diet doesn’t matter. Seriously. The data shows that at the one year mark the success rate for all diets is virtually identical. Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Mediterranean, South Beach, Zone, Keto, the cabbage soup diet… it doesn’t matter. In grossly simplistic terms losing weight is still all about calorie reduction. Expend more than you consume and you lose weight. Period. If your goal is weight loss, what’s most important is picking a diet you can stick to. The cabbage soup diet is probably not sustainable long term. If you’re picking a diet for other health reasons, blood sugar control, etc…, that’s a different discussion. Keep the two concepts separate and a pick a diet for the right reasons.
The history of Greenland’s melt cycles is interesting in light of recent “the sky is falling” news about sea level rise. As is NOAA’s potentially sketchy claims about February temps. Agree or disagree, the point is that maybe there’s more going on than we fully understand. That’s the point of science – to ask questions and search for answers. Don’t be a lemming.
I gained exactly 1 follower on Twitter. I find it interesting that on both Twitter and Instagram I get the most activity with posts or pictures of animals. People seem to like the hound. There must be some meaning around the human need to connect to animals and seeing happy things.
A video of all of the 8,000 meter peaks in the world. Worth it for the pictures.
I’m still not entirely sure why I’m writing. Performing for a nearly empty room day after day does get discouraging.
It’s interesting to watch the democratic 2020 candidates jockey for a campaign theme. I personally think that was one of the major factors last time. Like it or hate it, you knew exactly what Trump’s message was. I can honestly say I never knew exactly what Hillary’s message was. What is the central democratic message going to be for 2020?
Trying to heat a house in the mountains is challenging. Gas, wood, pellet, electric, hybrid… it’s making my head hurt. So many trade-offs between BTU’s vs energy cost and efficiency. It’s not like a plain ‘ole HVAC central heating system that makes all rooms the same temp. I will be very happy when I don’t have to think about this any more.

This is a perfect example of what’s wrong with news today. I like to think I’m reasonably plugged in… and I had absolutely no idea this happened last week. 1000+ people dead and 1.5 million at risk of water-borne disease or starvation. Meanwhile, Bob in Ohio was outraged at something someone said. We have a fantastic panel to discuss…
A neat video about cycling. I couldn’t do it, but a great reminder that we’re only here once. If you get hit by a bus tomorrow, are you happy with what you’ve seen and done?
Speaking of bikes, my town is installing this in one of the downtown parking garages. Yay for bicycle friendly!
Jim Acosta is the very definition of douchebag. I get it, he generates equal love and hate traffic. And yes, there are Acostas on all sides of the political spectrum. Sad that this has become the new norm for “news”.
I did not hit my weight target this week. It’s mostly meaningless… just a goal. Next week for sure.
Bullet Journal update: it went strong for a month, then faded. I still like the idea. I resolve to resurrect the habit.
A patient was unhappy with his diabetic menu choices, so his wife brought him Burger King and a supersize chocolate shake. When his blood sugar was 320 he was shocked. He was actually angry and accused us of giving him some “pill” that was making his blood sugar go up. It was a battle to convince him I had to give him insulin.
“This will be your favorite patient. Super nice and rarely calls for anything”. Sadly as a nurse, I hear that in report maybe once every three or four weeks. The vast majority of the hospital population are grumpy, sour, demanding people. They’re also in the worst possible health – much of which is due to lifestyle choices. I see a clear correlation between your upbringing, mental attitude, emotional stability, and overall health outcomes. It’s not rocket science, but it’s striking when you see it in front of you every day.
My internet went down for approximately 7 minutes today. It was a terrifying vision of the pending zombie apocalypse.

Notions Of Cool V.017
A random list of things and shower thoughts that an old Gen X dude finds cool or worth pondering.
Spring appears to be here (in the West anyway). Blue skies and no signs of further snow in the forecast. As much as I like winter, I’m done. Been thinking more of the bike than the skis.
Speaking of skis, my new ones are scary fast. Super stable at speed with no chatter. Several times yesterday I caught myself at ludicrous speed and thought… crashing would be bad right now. They are forcing me to be more aggressive, which is a good thing I suppose.
We had to hire a crew to remove our snow disaster at the house. These folks worked their asses off for days. The vast majority of the population in this country has lost that all-day farmer strength we used to have. We’re doomed when the zombie apocalypse hits.
Speaking of zombies, a great book to read is “World War Z” by Max Brooks son of Mel Brooks. It’s what the movie was loosely based on. And by loosely I mean they share the same name, that’s about it. One of the neat concepts in the book is that post-apocalypse, society flips. The blue collar folks become the sought after leaders because they know how to actually fix and build things. The white collar workers are useless without electricity and become the new ditch diggers.
I’m fascinated by the Instagram algorithm. How is it that an account with 1 post has several hundred followers, but others with many hundreds of posts have only a few?
My shoulder is still messed up several years later. I can’t do pull ups or back squats due to pain. I need to fix this somehow.
Hard to gage who will be the democratic front runner. Kamala would be their better choice, but Bernie has the dollars. Beto, Booker, and Warren will be busts. Yang and Schultz could be interesting. Biden is corrupt as hell and I’m not convinced he’ll run.
An interesting interview by CNBC with GOPRO founder Nick Woodman. I still think the main problem is the learning barrier to editing and creating a watchable video. People buy the camera, use it a few times then it sits. I may or may not be referring to myself.
Song of the day: Rebelution “Feeling Alright”

I listened to a pretty good podcast with Renee DiResta about the Russian trolling and social media tactics. The Russian government is clearly in it for the long game. The bulk of their influence happened because they understand we’re all members of one tribe or another – republicans, democrats, car lovers, gardeners, etc… We’re very susceptible to wanting to think like our tribe.
I also started watching Amazon’s “The Widow”. I’ve seen the first two. Not bad, a lot of moving parts. Keeping my interest so far.
Stumbled upon an intriguing service – Steady MD. Basically an on-line doctor. Communicate to your doc anytime via txt. Interesting idea. The monthly fee adds up to more than I spend in a year on health care, so probably not worth it for me.
The 2020 election cycle is going to be a train wreck. A horrible, nasty, divisive train wreck we won’t be able to look away from. A good time to stay away from the standard opinion news sources and do your own research. Whatever side you’re on, challenge your personal mindset. Don’t be a tribal lemming.
The icefall doctors have arrived at Everest. The climbing season begins. Not on my bucket list.
George Hincapie launched a hotel, “Hotel Domestique”. An interesting post career investment for a former cyclist.
Song of the day: Anna Lunoe “303”

The Rules
A few cautionary words before entering my world….
I am a contrarian and have little faith in conventional wisdom. I hold no allegiance to a particular political party. I swear, so if F-bombs offend you, kindly move on.
Life is short, I’m not going to take the world too seriously. Before getting your panties in a bunch over something I’ve posted, it was probably a poor attempt at sarcasm, cynicism, or dry humor. This is a no outrage zone.
I make no claims of literary genius. Punctuation is a never ending struggle. Don’t judge.
I reserve the right to change my mind at any time when presented with new information.
Welcome and enjoy the show.

Exclusive: New York Sandy ‘Climate Resilience’ Plan Won’t Address Climate Pollution

by Brad Johnson, campaign manager for Forecast the Facts
The nearly $300 million climate-resiliency initiative established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg using Sandy relief funds will not address climate pollution, according to a city official.
The New York City Special Initiative for Rebuilding and Resiliency (SIRR), formed in November 2012, will release a report this month indicating how $294 million in federal funding from the Superstorm Sandy relief act should be spent to increase the city’s “climate resiliency.” The report “will present policy recommendations, infrastructure priorities, and community plans, and identify sources of long-term funding” in addition to the emergency federal funds — but it apparently will not include an accounting of the carbon footprint of that infrastructure development.
In an email, SIRR spokesperson Daynan Crull told Forecast the Facts that because the initiative’s job is to “protect New York City against future climate threats,” it “does not directly address energy generation vis-à-vis fossil fuels”:
SIRR’s directive is rebuild and protect New York City against future climate threats, so it does not directly address energy generation vis-à-vis fossil fuels. However, New York City has been a global leader in environmental urban policy, pioneering PlaNYC — one of the most comprehensive sustainable and environmentally conscious policy programs ever established for a major city. It is upon this foundation that SIRR is built. Indeed PlaNYC established the New York City Panel on Climate Change, which is supporting SIRR’s work with the best climate science available.
Crull’s statement makes no sense — if SIRR’s plan is to “protect New York City against future climate threats,” it must necessarily “address energy generation vis-à-vis fossil fuels.” One cannot wall off energy use and infrastructure planning into separate boxes. This announcement is especially troubling because it is not clear that New York City is increasing any of its investments in renewable energy or carbon pollution reduction in response to Sandy. Instead, the city is moving forward with new fossil-fuel infrastructure, including a fracked-gas pipeline planned to cut through the Rockaways.

In 2011, PlaNYC set relatively strong climate-pollution goals for the city: a 30 percent reduction from 2006 levels of carbon pollution by 2017, with hopes of achieving an 80 percent reduction by 2050. However, much more ambitious targets are technologically possible — Stanford researcher Mark Jacobson has detailed a strategy for getting New York State’s energy use carbon-free by 2030. And no climate plan for New York City is complete without goals for divesting the financial industry from fossil-fuel producers like New York’s richest man, David H. Koch.
SIRR’s work will update 2011’s NYC Vision 2020 Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, which included a chapter on climate resilience, defined incompletely by the planners as “adaptation strategies” to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and more intense storms. The devastation of Superstorm Sandy gives the waterfront plan’s recommendations new and tragic urgency — one of the stated goals was to “develop a better understanding of the city’s vulnerability to flooding and storm surge.” The waterfront plan did not explicitly call for resilience measures to emphasize carbon reduction, an unfortunate oversight that looks to be continued.
It is possible that the public word from SIRR is misleading. The climate-resiliency plan is being developed in consultation with the New York City Panel on Climate Change, co-chaired by climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig and urban environmental scientist William Solecki; the NYC Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability, led since December 2012 by Sergej Mahnovski, a renewable-energy expert; and Goldman Sachs vice president Marc Ricks, a lead architect of PlaNYC.
Despite the official word that the SIRR plan will not address fossil-fuel energy generation, there are reasons to hope that the plan will promote infrastructure investments that are intended simultaneously to protect New York City residents from the damages of climate-change-related threats and to reduce the pollution that fuels those threats — and provide true climate resilience.

SC constitutes committee for safeguarding rights of minorities
9 Oct, 2018
Shares
Supreme Court of Pakistan has constituted a committee headed by former Chief Justice Tasaddaq Hussain Jilanni for safeguarding rights of minorities . A three member bench of the court, led by Chief Justice Saqib Nisar , heard the case about rights of minorities in Islamabad today.
The court directed that the Committee should have representatives of the Federation and provinces.

Back in 2012, I wrote an article listing 12 reasons why the “rock is dead” argument is hogwash. Hey, speaking of hogwash, let’s see what Gene Simmons had to say about the current state of rock:
The death of rock was not a natural death. Rock did not die of old age. It was murdered. And the real culprit is that kid’s 15-year-old next-door neighbor, probably a friend of his. Maybe even one of the bandmates he’s jamming with. The tragedy is that they seem to have no idea that they just killed their own opportunity — they killed the artists they would have loved. Some brilliance, somewhere, was going to be expressed, and now it won’t, because it’s that much harder to earn a living playing and writing songs. No one will pay you to do it.
There’s certainly some truth in there, but I’ve said it before and I’ll sadly have to keep shouting it again: rock music is still great; you just have to look harder to find it. There’s really no such as rock radio anymore, which is kind of Gene’s point, so if you want to hear guitar-based bands, you’re gonna have to search for them. To help you out, here are eight groups that released very good to great rock albums this year (I’m not including anyone that appeared on the 2012 list), some of which you may have heard of, others maybe not. But as long as we’re talking about them, listening to them, going to their concerts, and buying their merchandise, the rock will never die. Who are some of your favorites?
1. Mastodon

The masters of melodic, riff-based metal have matured over the years (2014’s Once More ‘Round the Sun is very good; 2004’s Leviathan is GREAT), but that hasn’t lessened their intensity.
2. The Black Keys
I’m not the biggest Black Keys fan in the world, but I understand why they’re so popular, and am glad they are. They’re as basic a mainstream act as you’re going to find — guitars, vocals, and drums — but that doesn’t mean they’re not vital; it just means they have to play that much louder to be heard over the deafening nonsense that is the rest of top-40 radio.
3. The Hold Steady
For a decade now, the Hold Steady has been making stream-of-consciousness bar rock that sounds like the drunken ramblings of a poet laureate. When you want to feel smart while pounding your seventh beer of the night, put on Separation Sunday or Boys and Girls in America, and before long, the entire tavern will be fist pumping along to “Chips Ahoy!” with you.
4. St. Vincent
She doesn’t always shred, but when she does, St. Vincent gets more out of her guitar in a single song than most bands do their entire career.
5. Pallbearer
“What did you do on your summer vacation, Timmy?” “Well, I spent a lot of time listening to this doom-metal group from Arkansas, Pallbearer. They just released this album called Foundations of Burden, and now I’m quitting middle school to form my own band inspired by it. We’re called Head Banging at the Wailing Viking Funeral. See ya, teach!”
6. Joyce Manor
Emo isn’t everyone’s cup of tea (that screams infidelities), but Joyce Manor is no Dashboard Confessional. There’s a big difference between whining into a microphone at the coffee shop, and masking your vulnerability with earnestly clever lyrics and by bashing an electric guitar. Joyce Manor is the latter. Recommended for fans of Taking Back Sunday.
7. Speedy Ortiz
If you still spend way too much time listening to Slanted & Enchanted, you’ll love Speedy Ortiz. The crafty Massachusetts-based group, led by Sadie Dupuis, make mix tape-worthy pop rock; the band’s jagged edges hint at something dark and honest beneath the songs’ surfaces, and Dupuis’ candid lyrics are perfectly paired with her melancholy vocals. Their latest EP, Real Hair, is only 13 minutes long, but Speedy Ortiz should be here for a very long time.
8. Cloud Nothings/Ty Segall
F*ck it. I know I said I wasn’t going to include anyone from the 2012 list, but Cloud Nothings and the ridiculously prolific Segall (he puts Ryan Adams to shame) have released two of this year’s best albums in Here and Nowhere Else and Manipulator, and you should put down your copy of Carnival of Souls and listen to them. Also, why do you own Carnival of Souls, weirdo?

NATO shows Russia its military might in giant exercises
Update: October, 25/2018 - 10:47
|
OSLO — Norway hosts NATO’s biggest exercises since the end of the Cold War from Thursday, to remind Russia the Alliance stands united despite seeds of doubt planted by US President Donald Trump.
Some 50,000 soldiers, 10,000 vehicles, 65 ships and 250 aircraft from 31 countries are taking part in Trident Juncture 18, which is aimed at training the Atlantic Alliance to defend a member state after an aggression.
"In recent years, Europe’s security environment has significantly deteriorated," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, of Norway, said.
"Trident Juncture sends a clear message to our nations and to any potential adversary. NATO does not seek confrontation but we stand ready to defend all Allies against any threat," he told reporters on Wednesday.
While the "potential adversary" has not been officially identified, Russia is on everybody’s minds.
The country, which shares a 198-kilometre border with Norway in the Far North, has repeatedly flaunted its military strength in recent years.
The Russian army has annexed Crimea, helped destabilise eastern Ukraine, beefed up its military capabilities in the Arctic, and conducted its biggest ever exercises in the Far East in September.
’Anti-Russian’ exercise
The Russian embassy in Oslo said it considered Trident Juncture an "anti-Russian" exercise.
"Such activity ... comes across as provocative, even if you try to justify it as being of a purely defensive nature," it said.
For months, Moscow has been annoyed by the growing Western military presence in the region. The United States and Britain have been increasing their deployments in Norway to accustom their troops to cold weather combat.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, speaking in early October, condemned what she termed as NATO’s "sabre-rattling", and vowed Moscow would take "retaliatory measures".
"The main NATO countries are increasing their military presence in the region, near Russia’s borders," she said.
"Such irresponsible actions are bound to lead to a destabilisation of the political situation in the North, to heighten tensions," she added.
Tensions already flared on Saturday after Trump announced he was abandoning a Cold War-era nuclear treaty, a move which Russia warned could cripple global security.
Accusing Russia of developing a new missile, the SSC-8, Trump threatened to increase the US nuclear weapons arsenal.
Article 5 secured?
Despite concerns about Trump’s commitment to the Alliance -- particularly regarding the "Article 5" mutual defence clause -- the US military is contributing the biggest contingent to Trident Juncture, with more than 14,000 troops, including an aircraft carrier.
"We exercise in Norway but of course the lessons ... from Trident Juncture are also relevant for other countries," Stoltenberg said.
On Tuesday, four US soldiers were lightly injured when trucks delivering material were involved in a pile-up.
In addition to NATO’s 29 member countries, Norway’s neighbours Sweden and Finland will join the exercises, which run through November 7.
Two Russian and two Belarus military observers have been invited to watch the manoeuvres.
Stoltenberg said he hoped Russia would "avoid dangerous behaviour". — AFP

Our Top Tips For Winter Eye Safety
Because it’s so much colder outside in winter, our instinct might be to assume that we’re safe from damage from the sun.
Unfortunately, this is not the case. We are just as vulnerable to harmful UV rays in winter as we are in summer. Our skin might be mostly bundled up from the cold, keeping it safe from UV rays, but what about our eyes? And what about other ways our eyes are vulnerable in the winter months?
Snow Blindness: A Winter Sunburn On Your Eyes
One way the sun can impact our eyes in winter is snow blindness. Too much sunlight can actually sunburn our eyes and cause temporary blindness, and this condition is much more common in winter due to sunlight reflecting off the snow. Because it can take hours for symptoms to appear, we often don’t know we have it until it’s too late and we’ve been exposing our eyes to all that sunlight for even longer. Luckily, there are things we can do to protect our eyes from winter conditions.
Sunglasses: Not Just A Summer Look
If you think sunglasses are only for summer, think again! A pair of polarized, 100 percent UV-blocking sunglasses are your best defense against harmful UV rays when you’re going about your day in snowy conditions.
Don’t Hit The Slopes Without Your Goggles!
Those of us who enjoy skiing or snowboarding will actually be exposed to more UV rays than people who prefer summer activities, because the atmosphere is thinner at high altitudes, making the sunlight harsher. This is just one reason ski goggles are a crucial piece of equipment for winter athletes.
When you’re looking for the right pair of ski goggles, there are a few things to consider. In addition to finding goggles with 100 percent UV protection, you can buy a pair that has vents or an anti-fog coating, preventing them from fogging up when you get going. Polarized lenses will eliminate that harsh glare off the snow, making it much easier for you to see the slope. If you wear prescription glasses, you can also find ski goggles that fit comfortably over them.
Combating Dry Eye In The Winter Air
The air can often be drier in winter than at other times of the year, and the heating we use indoors can dry it out even more. This can leave our eyes dry and irritated. To fight back against dry eye in winter, make sure you’re staying hydrated, use the seat warmers in the car a little more and the heater a little less, and consider getting a humidifier for your home.
Ask Us For More Winter Eye Protection Tips
If you’d like to know more about what you can do to protect your eyes from snow blindness, winter dry eye, and other problems we’re more susceptible to in the colder months, just let us know! We want to make sure all of our patients have the information and tools they need to keep their eyes healthy year round!
We hope everyone stays warm this winter!

How To Looking For Lower Cost Prescriptions
August 21, 2013 , admin	, Leave a comment	
Canadian medications are a big seller for those looking for lower cost prescriptions in North America and abroad. However, many customers are unsure of the reputations of some of the websites advertising the drugs. This is why canadianpharmacymeds.com should be your source for both prescription and over the counter Canadian Drugs.
The website shows its validation on the main page with its membership recognitions from pharmacychecker.com and the International Pharmacy Association of British Columbia. In addition, Canadian Pharmacy Meds is shown as a Certified Canadian International Pharmacy. Further proof of its validity is presented in its operating statement where it succinctly states the site doesn’t fill medications without a doctor’s valid prescription.
Ordering medicine at canadianpharmacymeds.com is a simple process. A customer finds their medication by entering its name in the search field, selects it, and then adds it to the virtual shopping cart for a secure checkout. Customers can also scroll down to the bottom of the page for a list of the most popular prescription and over the counter medicines for a quicker checkout. Those uncomfortable with online purchases can download an order form.
Contacting representatives at canadianpharmacymeds.com is a simple process thanks to toll-free voice and fax lines. Always looking to improve their performance, the website provides customers with another toll-free line to provide feedback on the website and overall customer service.
The government gives patent monopolies to provide an incentive for drug companies to carry through research. This is an incredibly backward and inefficient way to pay for research. It leaves us paying huge amounts of money for cheap drugs. It also often leads to bad medicine.
We would also end the phony moral dilemmas we create for ourselves with drug patents. Should Medicare pay 00,000 a year for a drug to treat a rare cancer in an otherwise healthy 80-year-old? This dilemma becomes a quick no-brainer when the drug is available for $200 a year in the free market with no patent protection.
Consumers also can save money on prescription drugs by becoming smart shoppers and knowing what to discuss with their doctor or pharmacist. Having discussions on whether a less expensive drug will work, comparing prices among U.S. pharmacies in the area or online, and finding out about assistance programs and how to qualify can help.

Downsizing the Carbon Footprint of Your Home
wildenlivinglab 12 March, 2019
A Case-Based Analysis Using the Wilden Living Lab
By Anber Rana and Piyaruwan Perera
PhD Students at UBC Okanagan
Downsizing the carbon footprint by selecting environmental friendly building energy systems can reduce regional carbon emissions and help put a stop to global warming. According to the research in the Wilden Living Lab (WLL), a 97% reduction of operational carbon emissions was estimated from the Home of Tomorrow compared to the Home of Today.
As concerns associated with climate change become more drastic and frequent, the need to minimize human activities impacting climate has become essential. Carbon dioxide is the largest component of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHG emissions are typically expressed as a common unit of global warming potential called Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq). This is used to represent the total carbon footprint associated with an activity (Brander, 2012).
Buildings are responsible for about 33% of the global GHG emissions according to a report from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP, 2009). In Canada, 14% of GHG emissions are associated with the residential sector alone (NRCAn, 2016). The carbon footprint of residential buildings can be significantly reduced through the use of energy efficient materials, equipment and long-term use of renewable energy-based upgrades. A residential building’s carbon footprint depends on household characteristics such as the type of residence, energy system performance, vehicle performance, and users’ behavioural patterns (Perera et. al, 2018).
The residential building carbon footprint is associated with activities shown in Figure 1. A recent review on 251 case studies highlights the importance of operation phase related GHG emissions that are approximately 75% of the buildings total emissions (Schwartz et al ,2018).
Calculation of Operational Carbon footprint
Total carbon emissions of a residential building depend on the supply energy mix and the energy consumption of the residential activities. These parameters are used to derive the energy supply emission factors. In Canada, the emissions factors vary with the primary energy sources (Kikuchi, Bristow, & Kennedy, 2009). Unlike other provinces in Canada, British Columbia has low-emissions electricity supply since a major of power generated by the electrical grid comes from hydro-electric dams. Electricity emission factor is 2.80 kgCO2eq./GJ whereas the emission factor of natural gas is 65.75 kgCO2eq./GJ (BC Ministry of Environment, 2014).
Equations (1) and (2) are used to calculate carbon emissions associated with the use of electricity and natural gas respectively,

Operational carbon emissions for building systems in the Wilden Living Lab
Since the operational phase of a dwelling is considered as a major contributor to the life cycle carbon footprint, the operational carbon footprint of both houses within the Wilden Living Lab were evaluated in this study. An energy simulation model developed on HOT2000 was calibrated using actual data obtained from both homes. The human behaviours were nullified using fixed parameters in both home of today (HOD) and home of tomorrow (HOM) models. The natural gas and electricity use determined through the software was used to evaluate the carbon footprints of individual energy systems. Figure 2 shows the building system-based results on the carbon footprint.
Table 1 shows the energy savings and emission reductions for different building systems in both homes. The highest carbon emission in HOD is from space heating and cooling activities using the natural gas (NG)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, while for HOM the highest carbon emissions are from lighting and appliances. It has been observed that upgrading HVAC systems using a state-of-the-art geo-source heat pump-based HVAC system will reduce a major percentage of the existing environmental impacts (reduce by 96.7%). However, the capital and operational costs of geo-source heat pump-based HVAC system could be higher than the conventional NG-based HVAC system. Moreover, replacing the existing HVAC system with new geo-source heat pump-based HVAC system may not practical for conventional households with conventional HVAC systems. Therefore, it is vital to check the practicability of installation and determine the eco-efficiency of alternative building energy system upgrades at the upgrade selection process (Eco efficiency can be defined as units of value generation per unit of environmental impacts (Brattebø 2005)). The total operational carbon footprint of HOD during the use phase is 5,746 kgCO2eq/year and for HOM it is 157 kgCO2eq/year (which is a 97% reduction in environmental impacts).
Be advised the carbon footprint calculated for use-phase does not include the carbon attributed by other household activities (building-related transportation, embodiment energies for replacement and maintenance, etc.), but this result can help in determining the relative carbon footprint impacts of different energy systems.
Stay posted for more real-life data results in the future. In next month’s issue, we’ll talk about energy efficiency changes based on indoor temperature set-points!

PENCE URGES LATIN AMERICAN ALLIES TO ISOLATE VENEZUELA
Pence urges Latin American allies to isolate Venezuela
By ken thomas, associated press
LIMA, Peru — Apr 13, 2018, 9:28 PM ET
Showing solidarity with opposition leaders, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence urged Latin American allies on Friday to further isolate Venezuela, suggesting the Trump administration would seek additional sanctions to counter the country's political crisis.
Pence, in Lima for the Summit of the Americas, was whisked away from the gathering and to his hotel shortly before President Donald Trump announced retaliatory strikes in Syria for apparent chemical weapons use. Pence had been scheduled to attend a banquet hosted by Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra on Friday night, and it was not immediately clear if he would still attend.
The vice president announced that the U.S. would provide nearly $16 million in humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans who have fled their country under the rule of President Nicolas Maduro.
"We want one message to be clear: We are with the people of Venezuela," Pence said at the U.S.ambassador's residence, seated with a group of Venezuelan opposition leaders.The vice president called Maduro's government a "dictatorship" and said the U.S. would continue to push a hard line against the country's leadership.
"The U.S. and our allies, I believe, are prepared to do much more," Pence said, accusing Maduro of" refusing humanitarian aid to be delivered to Venezuela." He said theU.S. would push "additional sanctions, additional isolation and additional diplomatic pressure — beginning in our hemisphere but across the wider world."
Pence is subbing for President Donald Trump after the president pulled out of his first planned visit to Latin Americat o manage the U.S. response to an apparent chemical weapons attack on civilians in Syria.
The White Housesaid Pence would sit down Saturday with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has yet to meet with Trump in an impasse over the wall Trump has pledged to build along the U.S.-Mexico border. Pence's meeting with Pena Nieto will follow Trump's calls to send National Guard troops to the border. That adds further tensions as the neighbors, along with Canada, work to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In a series of meetings with Latin American leaders, Pence plans to promote good governance and democratic institutions and urge allies to maintain pressure on Maduro. The U.S. has sanctioned Maduro and dozens of top officials, accusing the country of human rights abuses and sliding into a dictatorship.
With the White House's encouragement, Maduro has been barred from the summit over his plans to hold a presidential election that the opposition is boycotting and that many foreign governments consider a sham. During the meeting with four opposition leaders, Pence listened as they described their once-prosperous country devolving into chaos.
Antonio Ledezma, the former mayor of Caracas, pleaded with Pence through a translator to bolster sanctions against Maduro, asking for "not only humanitarian aid but humanitarian intervention."
The Trump administration is considering imposing an oil embargo on the OPEC nation, while Panama recently said it would pursue sanctions of its own — the first Latin American nation do so — by blacklisting dozens of Venezuelan officials from doing business in the Central American country.
Ana Quintana, a senior policy analyst on Latin America and the Western Hemisphere for the Heritage Foundation, said Pence would seek to "continue the momentum" of U.S.policy on Venezuela. She said the "vast majority of the region's democratic leaders have been so united on addressing the crisis."
Pence will also aim to counter China's attempt to exert more economic influence in the Americas at a time when the Trump administration has been embroiled in a trade dispute with the Chinese. White House officials said the vice president would emphasize the U.S. as the "partner of choice" in Latin American trade, noting that nearly half of the U.S. trade agreements are based in the Western Hemisphere.
Yet the timing of the trade pitch will be delicate. Pence landed in Peru shortly after Trump signaled his interest in possibly rejoining negotiations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Pacific Rim trade pact he frequently blasted during the 2016 campaign, injecting a dose of uncertainty among U.S. trading partners.
Richard Feinberg, a senior fellow in the Latin America Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said it would be difficult for the U.S. to make a case to become the "preferential trading partner" as Trump seeks to upend trade agreements.
"If it means reliable, predictable, Trump is the opposite," Feinberg said. "If preferred means lowering trade barriers, Trump is the opposite of that. He's talking about higher trade barriers and tariffs."
Trump, meanwhile, has long assailed the impact of NAFTA on U.S. workers and has insisted on a new round of negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Mexico on NAFTA. In addition to Pena Nieto, Pence is also planning to meet in Lima with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The U.S. president has been pushing a tougher line on immigration and seeking stronger protections along the U.S.-Mexican border in recent weeks. The president's recent tweets called on Mexico to halt "caravans" of migrants, many from Honduras, a message that Pence may be asked about in his discussions.

I posted in a previous thread that they would have their grubby paws out!
I am sick to death of these people!
We all need to report to ICE anything we see, we need to get 63 MILLION DEPLORABLES fired up and stop the bleeding of OUR tax dollars, stop the invasion of our country from around the World!
All employers need to FIRE ILLEGAL ALIENS and do the right this for this country.
It is not just crummy Mexico and Central America now...this is full blown invasion spreading like cancer that is going to cripple us all!!!

LOL!! YES YOU DID WISE ONE!!!
I agree with every word of your post!! Time for the Deplorables to unite and stop it with mixed messaging. We must lay it all out loud and clear in a united voice (you know like the Democrats do so well, the only thing they do well, but they do do that one thing well).

Children should never be put into a position where they have to choose between their parents, but one California teen found himself in that unenviable spot and shot his father to protect his mother. The man—who had a high level of alcohol in his blood, according to post-mortem tests—had gotten into an argument with his wife and started violently choking her. Fearing that his father was going to kill his mother, the boy shot the man. The investigation is continuing, but detectives initially classified it as a defensive shooting. (fresnobee.com, Fresno, Calif., 10/13/18)
The Armed Citizen Extra
A work-release inmate probably should have stayed on the job in Mobile County, Ala. After walking away from his assigned job site, the escaped inmate broke into his the home of his ex-wife, who held a restraining order against him, before later breaking into his uncle's residence. Upon discovering the intruder, his uncle shot him in the hand, prompting the escapee to flee the scene. (WALA, Mobile County, Ala., 11/08/2018)

How did the AAPI community vote in the midterm elections?
by Asian Journal Press	
0
Los Angeles Times
Democrats capture 72 percent of AAPI vote; job growth, health care cost and immigration reform listed as top concerns for AAPI electorate
The midterm election wasn’t blue wave that Democrats hoped it would be, but it garnered historic civic engagement
Though the exact number of votes isn’t official yet it will take the state a few weeks to tally up all the votes — the results available as of this press time are telling.
The Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Civic Engagement Fund, along with other allied organizations, released a nonpartisan report of the initial votes that shed light on the voting behaviors and attitudes of the major ethnic minority groups.
As extensively reported by the Asian Journal, the AAPI electorate is the fastest-growing ethnic voting bloc, according to U.S. Census data.
Focusing on six crucial states — California, Florida, Georgia, Texas, Nevada and Arizona — the survey compiled poll results gathered from randomly selected voters and found that the AAPI voting bloc solidly leaned Democrat.
Based on the findings, 70 percent of AAPI voters cast their ballots in favor of Democrats while 25 percent voted for Republican candidates. When surveyors posed the question of the quality of President Donald Trump’s job so far, 63 percent “disapproved.”
The survey also found that the top issues that AAPIs were most concerned for at the moment are the cost of healthcare, job growth and wages and immigration and the future of DACA, three of the most crucial and talked about issues of the Trump administration.
In a country that has historically (and, in certain pockets, presently) suppressed the votes of minorities and disenfranchised groups, projects like the American Election Eve Poll are designed to increase civic engagement among communities of color in order for elected officials, policy makers and the executive branch to address their concerns.
Geraldine Alcid, executive director of Filipino Advocates for Justice, said in a statement, “The growing influence of this electorate is being noticed by parties across the political spectrum. In 2018, Republicans and Democrats reached out to AAPI communities in higher numbers than ever before.”
The survey recorded specific attitudes that AAPI voters have toward the Trump administration and asked whether Trump “has ever made you feel” “proud,” “hopeful,” or “disrespected.
Respectively, 71 percent, 66 percent and 32 percent of AAPIs answered no to these questions. Moreover, only 19 percent of AAPIs agreed with the statement that “Trump has a positive impact on Asian Americans.”
Regardless of partisanship, voter enthusiasm increased from the previous midterm elections in 2014. The same survey found that 73 percent of AAPI voters in districts with key races encouraged family and friends to register and/or vote.
“I think this is just such a critical election for everyone, no matter what side of the aisle you’re on,” Jason Tengco, executive director of the National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA), told the Asian Journal in an interview.
“[Candidates] understand that Filipino-American and Asian American voices really matter. I think candidates on both sides of the aisle are paying more attention to that and campaign to the community,” Tengco added. “I think people were concerned about the direction the country was heading in so they thought it was important to come out and vote and make sure their voices were heard, and hopefully that helps steer the country in a different direction.”
Before the midterms, a massive survey by APIAVote on midterm elections showed that voter enthusiasm within the AAPI community jumped from 28 percent in 2014 to 48 percent in 2018.
The ethnic breakdown of that October study found that Filipino Americans were the group with the highest intention to vote in this year’s midterm elections, with 92 percent of the surveyed Fil-Ams affirming their participation in the midterms.
It’ll take a few weeks to see to confirm whether or not there was a significant uptick in the AAPI vote this year, but the clear increased civic engagement among AAPI’s this year, compared to that of elections past, can provide a strong tell. n

A Glimmer of Sunshine for Indonesian Rooftop Solar PV Projects

A Glimmer of Sunshine for Indonesian Rooftop Solar PV Projects
Share
Read publication
The Indonesian Government and PLN have felt increasing pressure over recent years to find ways to accommodate rooftop solar PV plants in the existing Indonesian electricity framework. This is both in a physical sense of how such rooftop solar PV projects can be accommodated within PLN's existing grid infrastructure and its constraints, and also how to accommodate such projects within Indonesia's complex regulatory framework governing the generation and sale of electricity.
The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) recently issued Regulation No. 49 of 2018 (Reg 49) as a first attempt at seeking to specifically regulate rooftop solar PV projects, and how they can find their way onto the PLN grid system.

Las Vegas shooting
Media playback is unsupported on your device
Media captionHow US mass shootings are getting worse
Three of the worst five shootings in modern US history have happened in the last 16 months.
It began - more or less - with 13, the number killed in 1949 in Camden, New Jersey, one of the earliest mass shootings in the US. An army veteran, Howard Unruh, killed his neighbours.
Over the next several decades, the numbers went up: 16 in Austin, Texas, on a campus in 1966, and 21 slain at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, California, in 1984.
The past month or so have been especially brutal, as two attacks unfolded - in Las Vegas (58 dead) and Sutherland Springs, Texas (26). They followed a June 2016 assault in an Orlando nightclub in which 49 people were killed.

Media captionWarning signs of a potential mass shooter
The reasons for this disturbing trend are many and complex, and people across the US and around the world have struggled to understand the violence.
Here analysts discuss some of the factors that may lie behind the grim numbers:
Weapons are more powerful - and shoot faster
The shooters have increasingly been using guns with high-capacity magazines, allowing them to fire off dozens of rounds without having to reload.
"There are more people being shot in a shorter amount of time - with more bullets in them," explained Harvard School of Public Health's David Hemenway.
Adam Lanza, who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, and James Holmes, who killed 12 in Aurora, Colorado, that year, both used weapons with this feature. The data's clear: the number of killings in individual attacks goes up when assault rifles are used.
Researchers have also examined the laws: a ban on semiautomatic military-style assault rifles and large-capacity magazines was passed in 1994. It was lifted in 2004.
Experts said lifting the ban helped to usher in a new era of mass shootings. With these weapons, individuals could shoot faster and for longer periods of time - and consequently were able to kill more people in their attacks.
In addition states have their own laws. After the Sandy Hook massacre, a Connecticut law was passed that banned some semiautomatic rifles.
Other states loosened their gun laws, however. In Georgia, for example, a law was passed that allowed people to carry weapons in school classrooms, nightclubs and other places. Experts at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence wrote that people in states with stricter gun controls tended to see less gun violence.
Assailants choose their sites more carefully
Attacks are now carried out in places with a large number of people - such as a Las Vegas concert venue with 22,000 people. "With that type of crowd, the shooter didn't even have to aim," said University of Central Florida's Jay Corzine.

Media captionAround 500 people were wounded by the gunman in Las Vegas
Most of the people who carry out mass shootings plan the attacks carefully, according to Homicide Studies.
"They're doing their homework," Corzine explained. Preparing the groundwork, he said, means the shooters kill more.
The gunman who opened fire at a Batman screening in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 "thought a movie theatre would lead to higher fatalities", said the University of Alabama's Adam Lankford.
The shooters are inspired by media accounts
Coverage of mass shootings - like the assaults themselves - have exploded in recent years. Shooters post on social media before the attacks and sometimes while the assaults are underway.
Media organisations create live pages and provide 24/7 coverage of an assault. In addition journalists often focus on the killers, providing details about their lives and unintentionally contributing to a glorification of these individuals.
Yet overall, say experts, the stories did not cause an increase in the number of deaths in the assaults. "I've seen media accounts of mass shootings for the past 25 years, and the uptick of high casualties has been pretty recent," said Corzine. Still the coverage gives people ideas.
"Mass shootings are contagious," said Gary Slutkin, founder of a Chicago-based organisation, Cure Violence. "People see what other people do, and they follow that."
The shooters compete with each other
Dylan Klebold, one of the attackers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999, described their goal: "the most deaths in US history…we're hoping."
As Lankford explained: "This really is a race for notoriety - to be bigger and better than the attackers who came before you."

Media captionWould we reduce the incentive to commit a mass shooting if we refused to report the killer?
Becoming famous as a mass shooter may seem like a sick glory. Yet it holds an allure for some. "It's, 'Well, yeah…,'" Slutkin said, describing how these individuals consider the possibility of fame and spend little time contemplating the likelihood of their own grisly fate: "It isn't all the way thought through."
"We all want to be known after we're dead," he explained.
"It shows how strong that circuit is."

Body Language & Emotional Intelligence: Nonverbal Communication Analysis No. 3520: North Carolina Coach Roy Williams' Reaction after Buzzer Beater Loss to Villanova - Body Language (VIDEO, PHOTOS)
Body Language & Emotional Intelligence
The Majority of All In-Person Communication & Visual Media is Nonverbal... How Much are You Missing?
Analysis, Secrets, and Advice from an Expert for the Real-World
Tuesday, April 5, 2016
Nonverbal Communication Analysis No. 3520: North Carolina Coach Roy Williams' Reaction after Buzzer Beater Loss to Villanova - Body Language (VIDEO, PHOTOS)
Last night Villanova defeated North Carolina to win the NCAA National Basketball Championship. The Wildcats won on a three point buzzer beater by Kris Jenkins.
The Tar Heels' coach Roy Williams, can be seen in the above video from 0:18 - 0:22 and again briefly during 0:27.
From a body language perspective, Coach Williams' expression in this image is telling (captured during 0:21). While his primary emotion is anger (probably self-directed) - characterized here by his drawn together and lowered eyebrows, the tension in his "mustache area", nostril flaring, his thinned and horizontally oriented lips - his secondary emotion, is that of regret. What are the particular facial configurations which tell us (very understandably) Williams is experiencing regret in this moment?

Doctor's Note – What is Being on Suboxone Like?
Written by: Dr. Justin Nepa
Suboxone is popularly known as a compound brand-named FDA approved prescription medication used to treat people addicted to opioids. It is a combination of two major component ingredients which are buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine acts an opioid antagonist, that partly inhibits the opiate receptors and curbs the addict's cravings while naloxone acts to discourage misusage, decrease diversion, and possible misuse. The combination of both agents helps... Read More
Doctor's Note - Being Treated With Buprenorphine is not a Life’s Sentence
Written by: Dr. Thomas Locke
You can get off of buprenorphine when the time is right without having to experience withdrawal. We began developing a tapering protocol five years ago that we have now perfected. I have made it available to all stable patients desirous of discontinuing buprenorphine. Understand that a percentage of people who are addicted to opiates will be better served with long term maintenance with medication assisted therapy. However, after adequate counseling and implementation of appropriate lifestyle c... Read More
Doctor's Note - Choosing the Right Addiction Treatment for You
Written by: Dr. David Kushner
Opioids are frequently used for pain management but can be highly addictive. For some, opioids produce a sense of euphoria that is so intoxicating they find it hard to quit. The addiction can stem from other underlying issues like the environment, upbringing, and trauma. Intense anxiety. Persistent vomiting. Profuse Sweating. Insomnia. These are just a few of the symptoms people recovering from opioid addiction experience as they go through withdrawal. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that 40 - 6... Read More
What is Buprenorphine?
Buprenorphine is an FDA approved opioid addiction treatment. Currently Subutex® & Suboxone® are the only Buprenorphine medications approved by the FDA. Buprenorphine itself is opioid itself, but the maximal effects are less than other more dangerous opioid agonist like methadone and herion. By producing enough agonist, individuals taking Buprenophine that have become addicted to other opioids are able to discontinue abuse with minimized withdrawl side-effects. In 1965, K.W. Bentley discovered the class of compounds synthesized from an alkaloid of thebaine, the opium poppy plant, known as Papaver somniferum. Among these semi-synthetic compounds is Buprenorphine - the first in a series of opioid agonists. Many were more than 1000 times more effective than the analgesic, morphine. In the 1980s, Reckitt & Colman, today known as Reckitt Benckiser, introduced Buprenorphine hydrochloride for sale. Buprenorphine, an analgesic, was first made in sublingual tablets of 0.2 mg (Temgesic). It was also made as an injectable of 0.3 mg/ml (Buprenex). Read More...
What is Suboxone®?
Suboxone® is the first narcotic drug available for prescription from a doctor's office for use in the treatment of opioid dependence under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 or DATA 2000. The primary active ingredient in Suboxone is Buprenorphine, which itself is a partial opioid agonist. This means the the opioid effects and withdrawal symptoms from Buprenorphine are less than other full opioid agonists such as heroin, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and others. Suboxone, taken as sublingual tablets or "under the tongue", has been shown to help in suppressing opioid withdrawal symptoms, decrease illicit opioid cravings and use, and under the correct supervision can help with overcoming an opioid dependence. Suboxone comes in 2mg and 8mg sizes of sublingual tablet form. Suboxone contains naloxone, which blocks the effects of medicines and drugs like methadone, morphine, and heroin. This is added to prevent people from injecting Suboxone and improper use of the medication. Injecting naloxone can cause withdrawal symptoms. Suboxone is the most commonly prescribed medication and given to patients during the maintenance phase of treatment. Subutex is typically given during the first couple of treatment. Because Suboxone has a lower potential for overdose and abuse, unlike methadone, Certified Doctors are able to prescribe take home supplies of Suboxone in certain circumstances. Read More...
The Benefits of Medication Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction
Since 1949, the 12-step program developed by Alcoholics Anonymous has been the dominant way we think about facing and fighting addiction. Many people have successfully used this community- and willpower-based approach to escaping addiction. However, countless others have tried it, and relapsed. With the powerful hold that opioid addiction has on so many people in America, it’s time to face addiction with an equally powerful—and proven—method: medication-assisted treatment (or MAT). MAT is the practice of using drugs like suboxone and subutex to help people dependent on painkillers gradually ease themselves off their addiction. While these treatments have been available for many years, there is a stigma to relying on these medications to help fight addiction rather than the traditional willpower and community approach of a 12-step program. Here are five benefits to using an MAT approach to ending opioid dependency:
1. MAT is proven to have better results than conventional programs alone.
2. MAT stops withdrawal symptoms so patients can live a normal life.
3. MAT is flexible, allowing medication to be taken at home or in a clinic
4. MAT offers multiple drugs (like suboxone and buprenorphine) to find what works for you
5. It’s easy to find an MAT/suboxone provider near you Read More...

Black Lawmakers Say Trump's Birther Issue Fueled His Candidacy
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus gathered Friday to respond to Donald Trump, who finally conceded that Barack Obama was born in the United States.

WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Black Caucus delivered a blistering critique of Donald Trump Friday, calling his candidacy for president a byproduct of his declaration that President Obama was not a citizen of the United States.
The Congressional Black Caucus political action committee hastily gathered the press outside of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center after Trump's admission that Obama was born in the United States, after years repeatedly questioning the president's citizenship.
On Friday, Trump said, "President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. And now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again."
G.K. Butterfield, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus gave a blistering attack, saying, "This is a disgusting day. By any definition Donald Trump is a disgusting fraud."
"Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been based on the birther movement which he founded, make no mistake," Rep. Barbara Lee of California said. "He founded and that catapulted into his campaign for the presidency."
The birther movement preceded Trump's raising it, but for years he popularized the issue, questioning the validity of Obama's birth certificate as late as the past year.
Ahead of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation holding its annual policy agenda conference, the gathered officials echoed a popular sentiment that Hillary Clinton should have not have walked back her comments that half of Donald Trump's supporters fit into "a basket of deplorables."
Congressional Black Caucus PAC Chairman Rep. Gregory Meeks, referenced the issue while talking about Trump's conduct. "That's what is was — deplorable."
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries called Trump a "two-bit racial arsonist who for decades has done nothing but fan the flames of bigotry and hatred" and said that his "leadership" in the birther movement was "nothing more than a fraud designed to appeal to "the racists, bigots and xenophobes who wanted to delegitimize the first black president of the United States of America."
The black lawmakers demanded an apology from Trump, called for him to drop out of the race, and used the opportunity to encourage Americans to get out the vote. But they stressed that birtherism was not just about Barack Obama's citizenship, but a dog whistle questioning the legitimacy and dignity of black Americans and people of color.
Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson said that Trump had used to the issue to was going to continue to fuel his candidacy. Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York said the issue was a calculated strategy, saying it sent "a signal out that he's not a citizen to remind Americans to know that his father and his ancestors were from Africa — reminding them that in their minds you have to be a European American in order to become president."
"No one can challenge that when Donald Trump put out the word that he has reason to believe that this black president was not a citizen, that he [didn't] know at the time that he was."
Meeks had the final word Friday. In recent days, he came under fire for saying on CNN that "deplorables attract deplorables" and that not all Trump's supporters are deplorable "but some are." Closing, he used the phrase again and again urging people to get out and vote for Clinton.

Prices for and Spending on Specialty Drugs in Medicare Part D and Medicaid
In recent years, the prices charged for specialty drugs have become a source of concern for many policymakers. Such drugs typically treat chronic, complex, or rare conditions, frequently have high prices, and may require special handling or patient monitoring. They accounted for a growing share of total net drug spending from 2010 to 2015 in both Medicare’s prescription drug benefit (Part D) and Medicaid. The net prices paid for specialty drugs are much higher in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid, and net spending on such drugs grew much faster in Medicare Part D than in Medicaid.

Lottery Jackpot Snagged From Trash
By Bootie Cosgrove-Mather
February 18, 2005 / 1:34 PM / AP
Karrie Jeremiah pulled a discarded lottery ticket from a restaurant trash can and hit the jackpot.
Two other people had purchased the $5 Hoosier Lottery scratch-off ticket last week at the Chaperral Cafe. When a clerk at the downtown cafe told them it wasn't the $40 winner they were hoping for, they threw it away, lottery officials said.
It wasn't a $40 winner - it was a $100,000 winner.
Jeremiah said she wondered whether the numbers were completely checked before the ticket was tossed.
"Who would ever throw this ticket in the trash knowing it was a $100,000 hit?" she said.
Lottery security director Ellen Corcella said the cafe clerk had not checked for any winning combinations other than for $40.
Lottery officials on Feb. 10 issued Jeremiah a check for $71,600 - the amount after taxes were withheld.
Corcella said the lottery was looking into the circumstances surrounding the ticket, but believed Jeremiah was the rightful winner.
"If I drop $100,000 in the street and walk away and the next person picks it up, it's their money," she said.
Mark McNeely, an attorney for cafe owner Shirley Bailey, said lottery officials had been negligent by not providing adequate training. "Let's focus on the real issues and not try to cast all of our blame on this little merchant here in Shelbyville when the lack of training may have been the issue that caused the problem to begin with," he said.

Seminar on Borders and Nationhood with Slate’s Joshua Keating
Tuesday, March 6, 2018 - 9:00am to 10:30am
Center for Global Development
The Center for Global Development is hosting a discussion with Joshua Keating, staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs. Keating will discuss his forthcoming book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood.
The book, which will be published in late June, provides a thoughtful analysis of how our world’s borders came to be and why we may be emerging from a lengthy period of “cartographical stasis.” Through stories about non-traditionally defined countries’ efforts at self-determination, as well as their respective challenges, Keating reveals that there is no universal legal authority determining what we consider a country. He argues that although our current world map appears fairly static, economic, cultural, and environmental forces in the places he describes may spark change. An excerpt of the book will be available at the breakfast.
At Slate, Keating focuses on international news, foreign policy, and social science. Before coming to Slate, he was an editor for six years at Foreign Policy. A native of Brooklyn and graduate of Oberlin College, he currently lives in Washington, DC.

How Do Cash Transfers Affect Who Calls the Shots in...
Michael Clemens
In a recent paper, Kate Ambler and coauthors studied the impact of one-season cash transfers for agricultural investment in Senegal and Malawi, using data from a randomized control trial (RCT) in each country. They found evidence that transfers reduced both the number of decision makers and female decision making in Senegal in the short-run, particularly for measures directly related to agriculture. However, the effects disappeared two years after the transfers. Conversely, the authors find transfers in the Malawi program led to robust transitory increases in these measures, seeing a greater impact related to the number of decision makers in the household persisting after two year period. Join us for the latest CGD Invited Research Forum to discuss these opposing findings on the effects of cash transfers on household decision making.

More Crop for Every Drop: Climate Change and Indian...
Justin Sandefur
Indian agriculture remains vulnerable to the vagaries of weather, and the looming threat of climate change may expose this vulnerability further. Using district-level data on temperature, rainfall and crop production, Siddharth Hari’s paper first documents a long-term trend of rising temperatures, declining average precipitation and increase in extreme precipitation events. One key finding is that the impact of temperature and rainfall are felt only in the extreme: when temperatures are much higher, rainfall is significantly lower, and the number of “dry days” greater is than normal. He also finds that these impacts are significantly more adverse in unirrigated areas (and hence rainfed crops) compared to irrigated areas. Can policy makers react to the challenges of climate change and find ways to get “more crop for every drop?"

US to Fail Paris Emissions Pledge Without ‘Fundamental Change’: Report
But any action is preferable to the climate future the U.S. could face under a Donald Trump presidency, experts warned. Maria Belenky, a senior associate at the policy firm Climate Advisers, told The Verge that “The key here is political will from the next administration and that’s gonna be extremely integral to whether or not we’re able to meet our targets.”

The financing package has been finalized for an under-construction multifamily development with 199 apartment units in Detroit that is expected to be complete by the end of the year.
The $65 million The Scott at Brush Park project received a $37.75 million construction loan and a $4.91 million bridge loan from Fifth Third Bank, plus $4 million from Capital Impact Partners’ and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s Detroit Neighborhoods Fund LLC, $2 million from the Detroit Investment Fund and $2 million from Chase’s Invest Detroit Fund.
An additional $1.5 million comes from a Michigan Community Revitalization Program performance-based loan and another $12.84 million in equity from an investment group led by Birmingham-based project developer Broder & Sachse Real Estate Services Inc.
Warner Norcross & Judd LLP represented Fifth Third on the financing package.
Matt Casey, a Warner Norcross & Judd partner who worked on the package, said financing negotiations took about six months. "Fifth Third's $42.66 million commitment allowed the project to get underway quickly and helped to ensure that it will be completed as planned," he said in a statement.
Southfield-based Woodborn Partners LLC is also a developer on the project, located at Woodward Avenue and Erskine Street.
Plans call for 63 one-bedroom apartments, 120 two-bedroom units, eight three-bedroom units and eight studio apartments. They also call for a 300-space underground parking deck for the five-story complex.
Additional details on the project are expected to be announced at an event next month, and preleasing is expected to begin this month.
Southfield-based Neumann/Smith Architecture is the project architect while Detroit-based Sachse Construction is the general contractor.
Broder & Sachse is responsible for leasing and property management.

Support Egypt Fund 306306 collects EGP1bn
Around EGP 150m have been collected between January and May 2014

The Support Egypt Fund 306306 has successfully collected around EGP 1bn, board of trustees’ member Hani Sarei El-Din told the Daily News Egypt Tuesday, adding that a “new round of fund collection will be announced by the end of June”.
The support fund was launched following the ousting of former president Mohamed Morsi on 3 July to accept donations from citizens and national and foreign entities to support Egypt. The account number 306306 refers to a series of massive protests against Morsi on 30 June leading up to his removal from power.
“We hit the ground [running] and our first 11 projects are underway,” Sarei El-Din said. “The projects will mainly focus on education, infrastructure in impoverished areas, health, and small enterprises.”
During a January conference, where the board of trustees signed an agreement of cooperation with government authorities, board member Farouk Al-Oqda said the fund gathered EGP 830m in donations. The armed forces threw EGP 300m into the pot, while businessmen gave EGP 300m and citizens donated EGP 230m, state-owned news agency MENA reported.
Al-Oqda said he expected donations to reach EGP 5bn within two years.
This brings the total amount donated in the three months following the meeting to around EGP 150m.
The board of trustees was formed in October to “independently manage the fund away from the government”, according to a government statement. Board members include TV presenter Khairy Ramadan, former Minister of Environmental Affairs Nadia Makram Ebeid, former Central Bank governor Al-Oqda, Owner of CBC satellite channel Mohamed Al-Amin, Sarei El-Din, and a representative from the Ministry of Defence.
The board of trustees also included poet Ahmed Fouad Negm who passed away in December.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina, marking the second meeting between the two leaders in Buenos Aires.
The leaders met amid a global outcry over the death of a U.S.-based columnist who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
The 50-minute-long meeting was closed to reporters.
"We had an opportunity to discuss the ongoing process in Northern Syria with the U.S. as two strategic partners. We discussed situation in Manbij, Idlib and terrorist groups in northern Syria with U.S. President Donald Trump," Erdoğan said later on Saturday.
Prior to that Erdoğan had closed-door meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
"Our talks regarding TurkStream are of great importance," Erdoğan said after the meeting with Putin.
The TurkStream project is an export gas pipeline set to cross beneath the Black Sea from Russia to Turkey and extend to Turkey's borders with neighboring countries.
Speaking about the four-nation Istanbul summit on Syria's northwestern Idlib, he said there were more steps needed to be taken.
"I find it very appropriate to have a meeting about Idlib even if it's for a short time," Erdoğan said.
Later on Saturday Erdoğan also said that Russian President Putin agreed on partial removal of visa regime between Turkey and Russia during bilateral talks.
Ahead of his visit to Argentina, the president said he would discuss with Trump the Manbij issue, a matter which continues to be an obstacle in the reconciliation of strained relations between the two NATO allies despite a deal made for cooperation.
Erdoğan is also expected to hold meeting wıth the U.K.'s Theresa May.
The Turkish president held talks with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chile's President Sebastian Pinera on Friday. The meetings were closed to the press.
During the gatherings, Erdoğan was accompanied by Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and Presidential Spokesperson Ibrahim Kalın as well as Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, the Turkish Presidency's Communications Director Fahrettin Altun and Trade Minister Ruhsar Pekcan.

( W. ATLEE BURPEE - W. Atlee Burpee)
If a fellow Whataburger customer pulls out a plastic snack bag of sliced tomatoes to put on his sandwich, it might be Bill Adams. He’s known on book jackets as William D. Adams, author of The Texas Tomato Lover’s Handbook, and he is a tomato zealot.
Adams once trialed more than half again as many varieties as the 57 Heinz claims — 89 different kinds of tomatoes in his own garden in Central Texas, near Burton. As a retired Texas Agrilife Extension agent, he is also a meticulous scientist. He noted the growth habits and susceptibility to disease of all these tomatoes. Taste, of course, is important to him, too.
For example, one variety touted on the cover of the Burpee catalog some years ago was so sour he couldn’t eat it. As for the bluish tomatoes trendy now, “they tell me you have to get them almost rotten soft to be able to eat them.”
He likes acidity, but not when it gives way to sour. “And then I like that complex sweetness that goes with it,” he says. “That’s really what makes a tomato zing.”
Adams and fellow retired Agrilife Extension agent Tom LeRoy spent a day in February with Tarrant County master gardeners and other tomato lovers, discussing everything from selecting a tomato variety to their care and feeding in the garden. In that auditorium, tomato fever was contagious.
Full-size hybrid favorites
Getting some of the varieties that Adams and LeRoy highlighted requires ordering from a seed catalog and nursing seedlings through long winter days. On the other hand, many varieties of tomatoes are available as transplants and bigger in local nurseries, and some are available in transplant size by mail order.
Fortunately for newcomers and gardening veterans who are short of time, Adams does like ‘Celebrity,’ the ubiquitous transplant on nursery shelves. Sure, it’s a little firm, but nothing like the hard tomatoes in supermarket bins. “But it has good flavor and nice acidity, some sweetness,” Adams says. Here is his take on other tomato varieties he has grown:
‘Champion’ is a favorite. “Good disease resistance and abundant, very tasty fruits make this one hard to beat,” he writes in his Handbook. ‘Champion II’ also has good flavor, although it produces smaller fruit.
‘Early Girl’ is a popular choice with good flavor, he says. Without nematode resistance — especially in sandy soils (heavy soils are not as vulnerable), in small gardens where rotating crops is impossible, and during the fall growing season — tomatoes can be plagued by these microscopic pests that infect the plant’s roots. (‘Celebrity’ is a variety with nematode resistance.)
‘Fourth of July’ surprised Adams with its medium-size early fruit “way before the Fourth of July” — and its productivity. However, it was a dud in the fall, and Adams blamed that on its lack of nematode resistance. It has good flavor, he says.
‘Juliet’ is also a favorite and a rediscovery for the two, Adams says. “I’ve had people tell me the skins are a little tough, but you know the quality’s there,” he says. “It’ll bury you in tomatoes.” It’s small-fruited and sweet but has enough acidity to be interesting, Adams says.
‘Sun Gold’ gets the highest praise from Adams: “It may be the best-tasting tomato in the world,” he says. “If they could make a ‘Sun Gold’ big enough to put on a BLT, I might just quit trying varieties. That would do it for me.” It does tend to crack, as most cherry tomatoes do. If you have a healthy harvest with some color in it — that is, you can see pink or red creeping onto the fruit — “pick hard” when rain is coming, Adams says. You can expect them to crack after a rain.
‘Sweet 100’ is a good producer, very tasty and sweet, Adams says. And it is claimed to have nematode resistance, which is a plus.
Heirlooms
When you talk about heirlooms, you have to accept that their quality is variable. “If you’ve got room, it’s worth having some heirlooms out there to see if that’s what you really want to strive for in the future,” Adams says. A drawback to heirlooms is that they generally aren’t very productive compared with hybrids, LeRoy says. “You have to make a choice: Are you going for production or for a particular taste?”
‘Brandywine’ is one heirloom that disappoints Adams. “There are better ones out there,” he says. But he does point out that there are different strains of ‘Brandywine.’ “So somebody might have one they like better.”
‘Black Krim’ is an example of the group of black tomatoes, and it is an heirloom. In general, black tomatoes “tend to be a little stronger on the sweet aspect,” says Adams. “They’ll have some acidity, but they have a complex sweetness.” In his book, Adams writes of ‘Black Krim’: “If you like to experiment with heirlooms, this is one to include.”
‘Cherokee Purple’ is another all-time Adams favorite: “It’s so sweet it almost competes with the bacon on a BLT.” It has nice acidity, too, he says. It bears large fruit.
‘Marianna’s Peace’ is an heirloom that Adams has enjoyed the last few years. “All of these heirloom varieties will crack. Just try to let them get a little color, then bring ’em in.”
Grafted tomatoes
When tomato varieties have a weakness, like nematode or disease susceptibility, you can sometimes overcome the problem by grafting the problematic tomato onto a vigorous hybrid rootstock, like ‘Celebrity.’
“By grafting an heirloom onto a hybrid, you increase productivity, we hope. You hopefully relieve the plant of some stresses, and you affect disease resistance,” says LeRoy.
The grafting process is complicated if you choose to do it yourself, and some do, because grafted tomatoes are more expensive than conventional transplants.
Is growing a beautiful tomato the top accomplishment of vegetable gardening? “There’s a great thrill to growing beautiful tomatoes,” Adams says. But it’s not enough to grow attractive, plentiful fruit. They have to taste great, too. Maybe like something you dream about on a fast-food burger.
Betsy Simnacher is a Cedar Hill freelance writer.
Tomato buzz
Burpee’s new ‘Summer Girl’ tomato is getting buzz because the company says it takes 49 to 52 days to mature. Considering the ‘Celebrity’ hybrid tomato takes 70 days, that would be a significant advantage in our short growing season. Our season is short, by the way, because we quickly ramp up to hot days and warm nights, which tomatoes do not like.
‘Summer Girl’ shares parentage with ‘Early Girl,’ says Chelsey Fields, vegetable product manager at Burpee. (‘Early Girl’ inexplicably is listed in the catalog as 59 days.) ‘Summer Girl’ yields bigger fruit than ‘Early Girl,’ or about a 6-ounce tomato, she says. Burpee estimates the yield is 20 percent bigger than ‘Early Girl,’ too.
Fields says ‘Summer Girl’ resists verticillium and fusarium wilt, but it doesn’t offer nematode resistance. “That’s a concern in the South,” Adams says, especially for fall gardens.
‘Summer Girl’ “definitely would be one that I would be tempted to try,” he says.
Tried-and-true tomato tips
How do you grow a crop to be proud of? Here are some secrets from successful growers, as outlined in the Tomato Roundup presented by Tarrant County master gardeners in February:
When selecting a tomato variety, consider trying one with the longest alphabet after its name to ensure the best protection against disease. Some letters you might see include VF (Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt fungi), VFN (Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt fungi plus root-knot nematode resistance) and T for tobacco mosaic virus resistance.
Plant early. Some plant as early as March 1, many more on March 15. The trouble is that we often experience late freezes. Cover carefully with an old blanket in case of sudden cold, Adams suggests.
When removing seedlings from pots, handle them by the leaf so that the stem won’t be damaged. Stem damage may stunt the plant, or it may die. Water immediately after planting.
Plant as far away from existing trees and shrubs as possible. Space tomato plants 3 to 4 feet apart.
While it is possible to grow a tomato plant without any support, it’s far better to support it in some way. While tomato cages you find at the nursery or hardware store will work for shorter plants, they cannot contain a sprawling vine with lots of heavy fruits. You’ll do better with a homemade, reusable cage.
Here’s a recipe for a sturdier support: Buy 5-foot concrete remesh (also called concrete reinforcing wire), which is made up of wire squares. Count off 10 to 12 squares, cut the remesh and roll it into a tube. A T-post provides a good stake. Use zip ties or hog rings (the rings require a special tool to close them) to secure it to your cage and both sides of your remesh tube. Bonus tip: Filing the sharp ends of the wire prevents cuts and clothing tears.
Compost, compost, compost. Adams uses a product called mushroom compost to prep his beds. It’s sterilized so he doesn’t have to worry about disease. But you can use regular compost, including the kind you make yourself, as long as you have lots of it.
Consider pruning the lower leaves of tomato plants, “say by the time they are knee-high,” to increase air circulation and help reduce the possibility of disease, says Adams.
Feed weekly. Organic gardeners can use cottonseed meal or a similar product. Conventional gardeners can stick tree fertilizer spikes near the plant. Other all-purpose organic or conventional fertilizers also are good.
Weed control during the first 40 days is critical. Adams and LeRoy recommend mechanical weed control, which is code for hands and hoes.
A layer of 5 to 6 newspaper pages (wet first to keep them from blowing away) underneath the plants also helps to control weeds. Cover with mulch; alfalfa hay is a good choice.
The top question Adams and LeRoy receive is about green, apparently healthy plants that aren’t bearing fruit. Possible answers include too much shade or a lack of fertility. Things that can cause a lack of fertility include stress from heat and dryness that can cause blossoms to drop off.
The best growing season is over when night temperatures are consistently above 75 degrees F and day temperatures are above 95 degrees F, says Adams. Then, most varieties don’t set much fruit, and what they do set tends to be smaller, he says. Cherry tomatoes, as a rule, continue to set in the heat better than larger ones.
Naturally ripened tomatoes (i.e., not supermarket tomatoes) ripen first on the inside. When 10 to 30 percent of the fruit is turning color, “the tomato is virtually all ripe at that stage,” says LeRoy. Finish ripening indoors, away from hungry birds.
Fall is another season for vegetable gardening, but in Texas that means starting in July. One way to start plants is by rooting cuttings of your spring tomato plants in water. Keep in mind, though, that nematode resistance is particularly important in the fall, since nematodes tend to build up in the soil over the spring growing season.
When it’s time to clean up the garden, check the plant roots for knots that signify nematode damage. If you find them, destroy the plants rather than tossing them into the compost heap. Compost piles that don’t heat to at least 160 degrees F. won’t kill the microbes.

The sample table above is a small selection of common procedures discounted by these discount dental plans and programs. Once you're a member, you will be provided with a complete fee schedule (applicable for most plans) with discounted fees for nearly every dental procedure. The procedures discounted under these plans and programs offer similar savings to the sample above. If you are looking for a specific dental procedure that is not on this sample, please contact our Customer Care Center toll-free at 1-888-632-5353 with the ADA Code of the procedure and we can provide the discounted fee.
Fee schedules and savings may vary by ZIP code and by Provider within a ZIP code.
The dental provider listings on DentalPlans.com are provided directly from each dental network or discount dental plan, which are responsible for their accuracy and completeness. These listings are updated on a regular basis, and every effort has been made to ensure that only participating active providers are listed. We strongly recommend that you confirm that a provider is currently participating before you receive any services from that provider.
Discounted fees listed under "Routine Dental Fees", "Fillings & Crowns" and “Root Canals, Perio & Dentures” tabs are for participating General Dentists. Consult with your provider prior to beginning any treatment.

ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
Savings plans are NOT insurance and the savings will vary by provider, plan and zip code. These plans are not considered to be qualified health plans under the Affordable Care Act. Please consult with the respective plan detail page for additional plan terms. The discounts are available through participating healthcare providers only. To check that your provider participates, visit our website or call us. Since there is no paperwork or reimbursement, you must pay for the service at the time it’s provided. You will receive the discount off the provider’s usual and customary fees when you pay. We encourage you to check with your participating provider prior to beginning treatment.
ABOUT SSL CERTIFICATES
Special promotions including, but not limited to, additional months free are not available to California residents or on Fully Insured Plans. Note – not all plans and offers available in all markets.

CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE
WASHINGTON – Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott spent nearly $63.6 million of his own money to win a U.S. Senate seat in November – a staggering self-funding record for a congressional campaign.
By unseating three-term Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, Scott also bucked a trend. The vast majority of congressional candidates who dig deep into their own piggy banks to finance their campaigns lose.
From the 1998 election cycle through 2018, 283 candidates for the House and Senate gave or loaned themselves at least $1 million, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance data.
Most reached into their own wallets and pocketbooks for the bulk of their money, providing about seven of every 10 dollars they raised for their campaigns, according to the center.
Of those, only 50 won (32 House and 18 Senate), or fewer than one in five.
That trend held in 2018.
Of the 15 Senate self-funding candidates in this cycle, only Scott and two others emerged victorious: Republican Mike Braun of Indiana who loaned himself $10.6 million and beat Democratic Incumbent Joe Donnelly; and incumbent Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who won a fifth full term with the help of $3 million she donated to her campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.
And of the 24 House contestants, only six won. That includes Democrat David Trone, who loaned or gave himself almost all of the $16.5 million he raised to capture Maryland's open 6th District seat. Two years ago, Trone lost the same race despite shelling out $13.4 million of his own money.
So why do self-funders have such a poor record of success?
Many of them come from the business world making their first runs for office. In their roles as executives calling the shots, they often don't have to engage in the glad-handing and face-to-face relationships required of political campaigns, said Meredith McGehee, a campaign finance expert and executive director of Issue One, a government reform advocacy group.
“The skill set they brought to their campaigns doesn’t translate very well into being a good politician and I think that’s why they often lose," she said. "A good politician is a good retail sales person and retail sales is its own world. And there are a lot of (self-funders) whose skills are in wholesale.”

Candidates willing to write campaign hefty checks also miss opportunities to connect with voters because they don't hold as many fundraisers or get on the phone to make personal pitches for help as much as their opponents do, experts say.
Of the nearly $1.7 billion the 283 self-funders raised since 1998, about 70 percent came from their own fortunes, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Self-funders, such as Scott, do have a compelling argument to make: They don't have to answer to industry lobbies or party leaders. It was a pitch Donald Trump frequently made during his 2016 presidential campaign and one many of his supporters cited as a reason they voted for him.

"In every election cycle, there’s always someone who does succeed (by saying) they can’t be bought," McGehee said. "Because the system is so broken, that is very attractive."
The $63.6 million Scott spent in his Florida race made up nearly 77 percent of the $83.7 million he raised for the race, which he narrowly won over Nelson: a 10,033-margin out of nearly 8.2 million ballots cast.
When he got into the race in April, Scott hinted he would dip into his bank account, saying, "I'm going to do whatever I can to win this election."

Scott, who made his fortune as a health care company CEO, has a track record of self-funding.
He forked over roughly $90 million to win two gubernatorial contests, in 2010 and 2014, meaning he has squeezed about $150 million from his bank account in the past decade to gain public office.
The Scott campaign said the self-funding was necessary to combat the tens of millions outside groups poured into the race to help Nelson.
"They failed, because the people of Florida chose a U.S. Senator who answers to them, not D.C. party bosses," said Chris Hartline, a Scott campaign spokesman. "Governor Scott has been blessed with success in his life and has always been willing to serve the people of Florida and the United States and give back to the country that allowed him to live the American Dream."

Betsy DeVos: A One-Year Progress Report
U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos faced a steep learning curve and the aftershocks of a fierce confirmation battle when she took the helm of the Education Department last February.

U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos took the oath of office on Feb. 7, 2017, which means that this week marks her first anniversary as the head of the Department of Education. Her first year in office has been a bumpy ride.
DeVos had decades of experience championing school choice before joining the Trump Cabinet. She'd been the head of the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy and political organization, but she had no experience working professionally in government, or in public education.
Her confirmation hearing—in which she appeared not to know what the main special education law was and suggested teachers may need guns to ward off "potential" grizzly bears—was the most controversial of any education secretary in history.
Thousands of calls poured in to key senators, urging votes against her. Educators and activists staged demonstrations across the country. Ultimately, two GOP lawmakers joined all the Democrats in voting against her, a 50-50 split. Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie to confirm her.
A year later, many teachers remain unimpressed.
"She's done nothing to disprove my belief that she is the least-qualified Cabinet officer in recent American history," said Nathan Bowling, who teaches Advanced Placement social studies courses at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Wash.
"There was a lot of momentum around closing the achievement gap that has been abandoned by the federal government," added Bowling, who was a Washington state teacher of the year in 2016. "Frankly, the department seems adrift to me. At no point in my 12-year career has the department been less relevant to what I'm doing."
But Laurie Villani, a kindergarten teacher in Virginia's Prince William County, has been heartened by DeVos' rhetoric on school choice, career and technical education, and personalized learning.
She agrees with DeVos on "the whole idea that one size doesn't fit all and it's very hard to change the classroom so that all children are comfortable" learning. "She's been able to open the door to people talking about it and thinking about it and that's the first step."
DeVos said in a recent wide-ranging interview that she's been unfairly pigeonholed as favoring only charter and private schools. She is in favor, she said, of public schools too.
And she thinks her status as an outsider—she’s the first secretary never to have worked professionally at a public school or college—has been an asset.
"I frankly think it's been an asset. I don't know what can't be done," DeVos told reporters. "And I come in with fresh eyes around all of these issues, and I think that questioning the way things have been done and being able to look at things from a different perspective is a good thing."
Here's a closer look at DeVos' record on a variety of fronts:
Choice
School choice fans saw DeVos' appointment as the best opportunity for a big federal voucher initiative in decades. But some educators were terrified that she would seek to "privatize" K-12 schools.
DeVos and her team have made only modest progress on school choice during their first year in office. Their one victory: language in the new GOP tax-overhaul legislation allowing families to use 529 college-savings plans for K-12 private school tuition.
In a recent interview, DeVos called the change, a "very, very significant opportunity and step forward for empowering parents with choices. It will obviously need some time to get it implemented in all of the states to an extent that we're going to really see the impact of it. But this was a big win."
She has said the administration would continue to push for policies that would expand more schooling options for needy families.
But so far, the GOP-controlled Congress doesn't seem enthusiastic. Lawmakers rejected Trump's pitch for a federal voucher program and for allowing some federal money to follow students to the public school of their choice. And prospects aren't likely to be any brighter for those initiatives ahead of what's expected to be a tough midterm election for Republicans.
Every Student Succeeds Act
DeVos' biggest impact on the direction of ESSA implementation may have come in the first few weeks of her tenure, when she supported Congress' choice to scrap the Obama administration's accountability regulations for the law. Since then, the Trump administration has been reluctant to issue new ESSA guidance, leading to confusion in states, critics say.
The secretary and her team have also weathered criticism for the way they have approached ESSA plan approval.
At first, Republicans, including DeVos ally Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, worried that the department was being too prescriptive with states. Alexander even said that Jason Botel, an acting assistant secretary, hadn't read the law carefully.
Since Alexander's statement, DeVos and her team have approved ESSA plans for 33 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In some cases, they greenlighted state plans even if the states didn't make changes the department explicitly asked for.
Now, Democrats and civil rights groups are accusing the department of serving as a rubber stamp, approving plans that flout the law's protections for vulnerable groups of children, such as English-language learners and students in special education.
DeVos rejects that accusation.
"I've said frequently, and I'll say it again, I'm only approving plans that comport with the law,” DeVos said. “And I'm encouraging anyone who's been critical of me and/or the department on approval of plans, that they in some way don't follow the law, I want to know where's that's falling short and where is that exactly the case. And I haven't really had any specific examples brought to our attention yet."
Bully Pulpit
DeVos entered office as one of Trump's most polarizing Cabinet picks—and months after her confirmation, she remained even less popular among educators than her boss, according to an October survey of 1,122 educators by the Education Week Research Center. Overall, 67 percent of the educators surveyed had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, but 72 percent said they didn't like DeVos. For months, protestors have followed her almost everywhere she goes—and at times, their message has drowned out hers.
Still, DeVos has been out on the stump and in schools lately, urging policymakers and educators to "rethink" schools—everything from lesson delivery to seat time to facilities. She's visited at least three dozen schools, a mix that's included private, public, and charter.
And she's highlighted what she sees as outside-the-box approaches to serving particular populations. For instance, on a back-to-school tour last fall, she dropped by a charter school in Indianapolis for students recovering from addiction.
But DeVos hasn't outlined specific steps the federal government might take to help K-12 schools innovate. Instead, she said she wants to empower districts and states to do this rethinking on their own.
In the past, the Education Department has been a barrier to change, pushing "one-size-fits-all approaches and solutions to things" during the Bush and Obama years, DeVos said. "You cannot fix what ails education by telling people how to do things from the Washington level down. It really has to be a grassroots local initiative."
She's also lent a lot of rhetorical support to career and technical education, saying that school districts should encourage students to think beyond the traditional four-year-college degree and consider career certifications, apprenticeship programs, and other possibilities.
Slimming Down the Federal Role
Last year, the Trump administration proposed slashing $9 billion from the Education Department's nearly $70 billion bottom line and eliminating big programs funding teacher quality and after-school services. It's unclear if Congress will embrace those cuts.
But the department has taken steps to scale back on its own. DeVos has offered buyouts, early retirement, and other incentives for dozens of federal employees. And she's scrapped more than a hundred pieces of guidance that she said were outdated or duplicative. The White House hasn't moved to fill all the subcabinet positions in the department, including the assistant secretaries for innovation and improvement and for communications and outreach.
And the department currently has a task force to comply with an executive order, issued by President Donald Trump in April, that calls for the department to get rid of regulations that step on local control in education.
"Some of the most important work we've done in this first year has been around the area of overreach and rolling back the extended footprint of this department to a significant extent," DeVos said.
Civil Rights Enforcement
Right after taking office, the Trump administration rescinded guidance put out by President Barack Obama that called for transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity. And DeVos is contemplating delaying for two years an Obama-era rule that would require states to use a standardized approach to figuring out if they have too many minority students in special education or if they're punishing them or putting them in restrictive settings more than white students.
"This department's role in ensuring students' civil rights and ensuring the rights under the [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act], those are important roles,” DeVos said. "It's hurtful to me when I'm criticized for not upholding the rights of students. For not caring about students with special needs. Nothing could be further from the truth."

DeVos has also met with both supporters and critics of Obama-era guidance that pushed school officials to ensure that their discipline policies don't have a disparate impact on students from certain racial and ethnic groups.
Her team also made changes to the way civil rights cases are reviewed. The department is no longer automatically checking complaints for evidence of systemic discrimination, a practice established during the Obama years.
Higher Education
This is where most of the action has occurred. DeVos and her team are in the early stages of rewriting two sets of regulations put out by the Obama administration and intended to protect student borrowers: gainful employment, which was intended to weed out programs that required big tuition payments but offered dim job prospects, and borrower defense, which helps students who took out loans to attend institutions later found to be fraudulent. She also scrapped Obama's rules governing sexual assault on college campuses and is working on a replacement. (That has some implications for K-12 schools, which sometimes take their cues on how to handle alleged sexual-assault cases from higher education.)

EEA-32 emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) have decreased by 31% between 1990 and 2007. In 2007, the most significant sources of NO x emissions were the road transport sector (36%), combustion processes from within the energy industries sector (21%) and industrial energy use (15%) and the non-road transport sector (16%). The largest reduction of emissions since 1990 has occurred in the road transport sector. These reductions have been achieved despite the general increase in activity within this sector since the early 1990s and have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting three-way catalysts to petrol fuelled vehicles. In the electricity/energy production sector reductions have also occurred, in these instances as a result of measures such as the introduction of combustion modification technologies (such as use of low NO x burners), implementation of flue-gas abatement techniques (e.g. NO x scrubbers and selective (SCR) and selective non-catalytic (SNCR) reduction techniques) and fuel-switching from coal to gas. The National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) specifies NO x emission ceilings for Member States that must be met by 2010. In general, the newer Member States have made substantially better progress towards meeting their respective NOx ceilings than the older Member States of the EU-15. Eleven of the twelve post-2004 Member States have already reduced emissions beyond what is required under the NECD, or are very close to doing so (Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). In contrast, only one EU-15 Member State (Portugal) has emissions within its respective national ceiling. Many Member States therefore must make significant cuts to NO x emissions in the immediate coming years if they are to meet their obligations under the NECD. Environmental context: NO x contributes to acid deposition and eutrophication. The subsequent impacts of acid deposition can be significant, including adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems in rivers and lakes and damage to forests, crops and other vegetation. Eutrophication can lead to severe reductions in water quality with subsequent impacts including decreased biodiversity, changes in species composition and dominance, and toxicity effects. It is NO 2 that is associated with adverse affects on human health, as at high concentrations it can cause inflammation of the airways. NO 2 also contributes to the formation of secondary particulate aerosols and tropospheric ozone in the atmosphere - both are important air pollutants due to their adverse impacts on human health.

EEA-32 NOx emissions have decreased by 31% between 1990 and 2007. The majority of EEA-32 countries have reported lower emissions of NOx in 2007 compared to 1990. The exceptions to this are Austria (+14% increase between 1990 and 2007), Cyprus (+24%), Greece (+25%), Malta (20%), Portugal (+2%), Spain (+20%) and Turkey (85%).
In general, the newer Member States of the European Union have made substantially better progress towards meeting their respective NOx ceilings than the older EU-15 Member States. Eleven of the twelve post-2004 Member States have already reduced emissions beyond what is required under the NECD, or are very close to doing so (Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). In contrast, only one EU-15 Member State (Portugal) has emissions within its respective national ceiling.
Many Member States are not considered to be on track towards meeting their obligations under the NECD. In particular Austria, Spain, Ireland, Malta, France, Belgium and Greece must still make significant cuts to NOx emissions in the immediate coming years if they are to meet their obligations under the NECD. Emissions have actually increased in Austria (+14%), Cyprus (+24%), Greece (+25%), Malta (20%), Portugal (+2%) and Spain (+20%) during the period 1990 to 2007, despite all countries having obligations to reduce emissions under the NECD and Gothenburg Protocol.
The EFTA-4 (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) and CC-3 (Croatia, FYR of Macedonia and Turkey) countries are not members of the European Union and hence have no emission ceilings set under the NECD. However, Switzerland and Norway have ratified the Gothenburg Protocol, requiring them to reduce their emissions to the agreed ceiling specified in the protocol by 2010. Switzerland is close to meeting its Gothenburg Protocol ceiling, whilst Norway, which has not yet met its national ceiling still must make a significant reduction to NOx emissions.
How do different sectors and processes contribute to emissions of NOx?

Reductions of NOx have occurred in all economic sectors. The three sectors responsible for the vast majority of the decline in NOx emissions are 'road transport' (contributing 46% of the total reduction in NOx emissions reported by countries), 'energy industries' (contributing 28%), and 'industry (energy)' (contributing 9%).<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
Significant reductions have occurred in the 'road transport' sector since the early 1990s (36% reduction between 1990 and 2007). This has been achieved despite the general increase in activity within this sector over the period. The emission reductions have primarily been achieved as a result of fitting catalysts to vehicles (driven by the legislative 'Euro' standards). However, across Europe there is also an increasing awareness of the contribution made to NOx pollutant emissions by national and international ship traffic (a more detailed discussion of this issue is contained in the TERM indicator fact sheet TERM03 - Transport emissions of air pollutants).
Emissions of NOx have also declined in the 'energy industries' (21% reduction between 1990 and 2007). In the electricity/energy production sector this has been achieved through the implementation of measures such as combustion modification, introduction of flue-gas abatement techniques and a fuel-switching from coal to gas. One of the most common forms of combustion modification is to use low NOx burners, which typically can reduce NOx emissions by up to 40%. Flue gas treatment techniques (e.g. NOx scrubbers and selective (SCR) and selective non-catalytic (SNCR) reduction techniques) can also be used to remove NOx from the flue gases. Emissions of NOx are higher from coal-fired power plants than from gas-fired plants as a result of coal containing significant amounts of nitrogen (unlike gas) and their less efficient combustion processes.
The newer Member States of the European Union have in a number of cases also undergone significant economic structural changes since the early 1990s which has led to a general decline in certain activities which previously contributed to high levels of NOx emissions e.g. heavy industry and the closure of older inefficient power plants.

Rationale
Justification for indicator selection
Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are together referred to as nitrogen oxides (NOx). Combustion of fossil fuels is by far the dominant source of NOx emissions. The emissions are not dependent solely on the amount of nitrogen in the fuel but also on the air - fuel mix ratio. High temperatures and oxidation-rich conditions generally favour NOx formation in combustion.
NOx contributes to acid deposition and eutrophication which in turn can lead to potential changes occurring in soil and water quality. The subsequent impacts of acid deposition can be significant, including adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems in rivers and lakes and damage to forests, crops and other vegetation. Eutrophication can lead to severe reductions in water quality with subsequent impacts including decreased biodiversity, changes in species composition and dominance, and toxicity effects. In many cases, the deposition of acidifying and eutrophying substances still exceeds the critical loads of the ecosystems (see EEA indicator CSI 005 'Exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone'). Further details concerning emissions of acidifying pollutants are provided in EEA's Core Set Indicator CSI 001 'Emissions of acidifying substances'.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
It is NO2 that is associated with adverse affects on human health, as at high concentrations it can cause inflammation of the airways. NO2 also contributes to the formation of secondary particulate aerosols and tropospheric ozone (O3) in the atmosphere - both are important air pollutants due to their adverse impacts on human health. NOx is therefore linked both directly and indirectly to effects on human health. Further details concerning the contribution of NOx to emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors and particulate matter are contained in EEA's Core Set Indicators CSI 002 'Emissions of ozone precursors' and CSI 003 'Emissions of primary particles and secondary particulate precursors'.

Policy context and targets
Context description
A number of policies have been implemented that directly or indirectly reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides. These include:
The National Emission Ceilings Directive 2001/81/EC (NECD) which entered into force in the European Community in 2001. The NECD sets emission ceilings for four important air pollutants (NOx, sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)) to be achieved from 2010 onwards for each Member State. The ceilings are designed to improve the protection in the Community of the environment and human health against risks of adverse effects arising from acidification, eutrophication and ground level ozone. The NECD is presently under review, the European Commission may adopt a proposal for a revised Directive during 2010.
The Gothenburg Protocol (1999) to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's (UNECE) Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone. A key objective of the protocol is to regulate emissions on a regional basis within Europe and to protect eco-systems from transboundary pollution by setting emission reduction ceilings to be reached by 2010 for the same 4 pollutants as addressed in the NECD (i.e. SO2, NOx, NH3 and NMVOCs). Overall for the EU Member States, the ceilings set within the Gothenburg protocol are generally either slightly less strict or the same as the emission ceilings specified in the NECD.
The Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC) is important in reducing emissions of NOx, SO2 and dust from combustion plants having a thermal capacity equal to or greater than 50 MW. Installations within the scope of this Directive include power stations, petroleum refineries, steelworks and other industrial processes running on solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. "New" plant must meet the emission limit values (ELVs) given in the LCPD. However Member States can choose to meet obligations for existing plant (i.e. those in operation per-1987) by either complying with the ELVs or they can operate within a national emission reduction plan (NERP) that sets a ceiling for each pollutant. The interaction of the LCPD and the IPPC Directive (see below) is currently being examined as part of a review of the IPPC Directive.
The Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (96/61/EC) entered into force in 1999. It aims to prevent or minimise pollution to air, water or land from various industrial sources throughout the European Union. Those installations covered by Annex I of the IPPC Directive are required to obtain authorisation from the authorities to operate. New installations and existing installations, which are subject to 'substantial changes' have been required to meet the requirements of the IPPC Directive since 30th October 1999. Other existing installations must have been brought into compliance by the 30th October 2007. The emission limit values outlined in the permit conditions must be based on the best available techniques (BAT). The Commission has been undertaking a review of the IPPC Directive and related legislation on industrial emissions and on the 21st December 2007 adopted a proposal for a Directive on industrial emissions. The proposal recasts seven existing Directives relating to industrial emissions (including IPCC and the LCPD) into a single legislative instrument.
The aim of the Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management (the 'Air Quality Framework Directive') is to maintain and improve air quality within the European Community by establishing objectives for ambient air, drawing up common methods and criteria for assessing air quality and obtaining and disseminating information. The first "Daughter" Directive 99/30/EC entered into force in 1999 and set limit values for hourly and annual average nitrogen dioxide concentrations to be achieved throughout the community by 1st January 2010.
Since the early 1990s standards on NOx emissions from new cars sold in Europe have been in place. This first came about with EU Directive 91/441/EC, which effectively mandated the fitting of three-way catalysts to all new petrol cars to significantly reduce emissions of CO, hydrocarbons and NOx. Standards for this Directive, frequently referred to as Euro 1, were followed by Euro 2 standards implemented by Directive 94/12/EC during the mid 1990s. Yet more stringent EU Directives have been put in place to reduce NOx emissions further, the most recent being (98/69/EC) setting emission limits for petrol cars sold after 2000 and then after 2005 (Euro 3 and 4 standards respectively).
NOx emissions from diesel vehicles have also been regulated since the early 1990s (since 1988 for heavy duty vehicles) with a succession of more stringent EU Directives. The legislation currently in force for heavy duty vehicles is 2005/55/EC and 2005/78/EC (implementing provisions) which define the emission standard currently in force, Euro IV, as well as the next stage (Euro V) which entered into force in October 2008.
In parallel with vehicle technology developments, improvements in the quality of petrol and diesel fuels have been made as a result of the EU Directive on fuel quality (98/70/EC as amended by 2003/17/EC). Fuel quality has little effect on NOx emissions directly, but improvements in fuel quality have allowed the fitting of exhaust after-treatment technologies and provided better catalyst performance, hence helping to reduce NOx emissions further.
Directive 97/68/EC on the emissions of pollutants from internal combustion engines installed in non road mobile machinery sets emission standards and type approval procedures for engines fitted to non road mobile machinery.
Targets
Emissions of NOx are covered by the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) (2001/81/EC) and the Gothenburg protocol under the United Nations Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention) (UNECE 1999). The NECD generally involves slightly stricter emission reduction targets than the Gothenburg Protocol for EU-15 countries for the period 1990-2010. The Gothenburg Protocol entered into force on 17 May 2005, after ratification by 16 countries early in 2005.

# The actual 2010 emission ceilings specified in the NECD and Gothenburg Protocol are expressed as absolute emissions of SO2, NOx, NH3 and NMVOC (in ktonnes). For the purposes of this indicator 1990 is considered as a 'base year' and the percentage change to emissions to meet the ceilings is calculated. Reported emissions for past years may change reflecting e.g. updated and revised emission inventory guidance, and so the % reduction required to meet the CLRTAP and NECD targets as shown here may change slightly in the future.

Directive 2001/81/EC, national emission ceilings
Directive 2001/81/EC, on nation al emissions ceilings (NECD) for certain atmospheric pollutants. Emission reduction targets for the new EU10 Member States have been specified in the Treaty of Accession to the European Union 2003 [The Treaty of Accession 2003 of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia. AA2003/ACT/Annex II/en 2072] in order that they can comply with the NECD.
Methodology
Methodology for indicator calculation
Indicator is based on officially reported national total and sectoral emissions to UNECE/EMEP (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Co-operative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention), submission 2009. Recommended methodologies for emission inventory estimation are compiled in the EMEP/CORINAIR Atmospheric Emission Inventory guidebook, EEA Copenhagen (EEA, 2009). Base data are available from the EEA Data Service (http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/dataservice/metadetails.asp?id=1096) and the EMEP web site (http://www.ceip.at/). Where necessary, gaps in reported data are filled by ETC/ACC using simple interpolation techniques (see below). The final gap-filled data used in this indicator is available from the EEA Data Service (http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/dataservice/metadetails.asp?id=1058).
Base data, reported in SNAP, draft NFR or NFR are aggregated into the following EEA sector codes to obtain a common reporting format across all countries and pollutants:
'Energy industries': emissions from public heat and electricity generation, oil refining and production of solid fuels;
'Fugitive emissions': Emissions from extraction and distribution of solid fossil fuels and geothermal energy;
'Industry (Energy)': emissions from combustion processes used in the manufacturing industry including boilers, gas turbines and stationary engines;
'Industry (Processes)': emissions derived from non-combustion related processes such as the production of minerals, chemicals and metal production;
'Road transport': light and heavy duty vehicles, passenger cars and motorcycles;
'Off-road transport': railways, domestic shipping, certain aircraft movements, and non-road mobile machinery used in agriculture & forestry;
'Other (energy-related)': emissions principally occurring from fuel combustion in the services and household sectors;
'Other (Non Energy)': non-combustion related emissions mainly in the services and households sectors including activities such as paint application, dry-cleaning and other use of solvents;
'Agriculture': manure management, fertiliser application, field-burning of agricultural wastes
'Waste': incineration, waste-water management;
'Unallocated': The difference between the reported national total and the sum of the sectors reported by a country.
The 'unallocated' sector corresponds to the difference between the reported national total and the sum of the reported sectors for a given pollutant / country / year combination. It can be either negative or positive. Inclusion of this additional sector means that the officially reported national totals do not require adjustment to ensure that they are consistent with the sum of the individual sectors reported by countries.

Methodology for gap filling
EEA/ETC-ACC gap-filling methodology. To allow trend analysis where countries have not reported data for one or several years, data has been interpolated to derive annual emissions. If the reported data is missing either at the beginning or at the end of the time series period, the emission value has been considered to equal the first (or last) reported emission value. It is recognised that the use of gap-filling can potentially lead to artificial trends, but it is considered unavoidable if a comprehensive and comparable set of emissions data for European countries is required for policy analysis purposes.
Methodology references
No methodology references available.
Uncertainties
Methodology uncertainty
The use of gap-filling for when countries have not reported emissions for one of more years can potentially lead to artificial trends, but it is considered unavoidable if a comprehensive and comparable set of emissions data for European countries is required for policy analysis purposes.
Data sets uncertainty
NOx emission estimates in Europe are thought to have an uncertainty of about ±20% (EMEP, 2009), as the NOx emitted comes both from the fuel burnt and the combustion air and so cannot be estimated accurately from fuel nitrogen alone. However, because of the need for interpolation to account for missing data, the complete dataset used will have higher uncertainty. The trend is likely to be more accurate than the individual absolute annual values - the annual values are not independent of each other.
Overall scoring: (1-3, 1=no major problems, 3=major reservations)
Relevancy: 1
Accuracy: 2
Comparability over time: 2
Comparability over space: 2
Rationale uncertainty
This indicator on emissions of Nitrogen oxide is produced annually by EEA and is used regularly in its State of the Environment reporting. The uncertainties related to methodology and data sets are therefore of importance. Any uncertainties involved in the calculation and in the data sets need to be accurately communicated in the assessment, to prevent erroneous messages influencing policy actions or processes.

Indicator Assessment

The EU fishing fleet displays strong regional differences in terms of its composition, but it is mostly made up of small vessels (59%). There has been a marked decrease in fishing fleet capacity (i.e. number of vessels) between 2004 and 2001 , during which time small vessels decreased at an annual rate of approximately 1% and large vessels at 7% . Most of the EU fishing effort is deployed by large vessels (74%) with mobile gears, of which the majority (61%) disturbs the seafloor. The decrease in capacity has been followed by a decrease in the effort of large vessels only (over 7% between 2004-2011), while the effort of small vessels has increased by approximately 5%. This is reflected in an overall shift towards gear with less impact on the seafloor. The observed change of EU fishing effort and the shift towards gear with less impact is indicative of an overall decrease in fishing pressure and impact in European seas between 2004 and 2011.

Electricity
Calif. PUC's Picker says DOE grid study to have little impact on utilities, operators
OnPoint: Wednesday, August 2, 2017
As the Trump administration moves to reverse Obama-era policies aimed at reducing emissions, California recently extended its greenhouse gas market through 2030. Will the Trump administration's air policies have an impact on California's efforts to reduce emissions? During today's OnPoint, Michael Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, explains why he believes the federal policy landscape will not affect states that have acted aggressively on emissions.

Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Kanye West's TMZ Live Interview

Jimmy Kimmel shouldn't be surprised if he's the target of Kanye West's next Twitter tirade.
West's return to Twitter has left many scratching their heads, and his recent interviews have done the same. On ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! Tuesday, the host spoke about one of the more bizarre discussions West had with Harvey Levin. "For whatever reason, Kanye felt the need to spend a full hour on TMZ Live today to defend his love for Donald Trump and to go off on a tangent not seen since the glory days of Gary Busey on Celebrity Rehab," Kimmel joked. He then played clips from the interview, in which West revealed he became addicted to opioids after getting liposuction. "I had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for y'all!" West yelled. Before he was hospitalized, he was taking two pills a day. "When I left the hospital, how many pills you think I was given? Seven!" he said. "I went from taking two pills to taking seven!"
Quipped Kimmel, "Maybe you should be taking eight."
At another point, West ranted, "TMZ is the hospital to fix the world." Kimmel joked, "Wow, healthcare really is in bad shape if TMZ is a hospital. If TMZ is a hospital, it's a mental hospital!"
Kimmel, like many of his audience members, was dumbfounded by West's TMZ Live interview. "Here's the thing: This job, doing this show every night, is hard enough. Keeping up with the White House on a daily basis is exhausting. I can't handle Donald Trump and Kanye West at the same time. It's too much. It's like being a single mother with twins. I can't do it!" he said. "One of you is gonna have to stop—I'll let you decide between yourselves which one it's going to be."

Of course, Kimmel has quite a history with West.
In the fall of 2013, West went on a Twitter rant after Kimmel aired a sketch involving kids re-enacting the rapper's interview with BBC Radio 1, where he dubbed himself "the biggest rock star on the planet." After some back and forth, Kimmel invited West to appear on his late-night talk show to clear the air. Though he apologized, he added, "A lot of people think you're a jerk." To his credit, the rapper acknowledged he's known to be "weird and inappropriate sometimes."

"I do think somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you're coming from," Kimmel said. "Correct?" The rapper gave him a one-word answer, replying, "Yeah." But West became more animated as the interview progressed. "I've never done a publicity stunt in my life. I don't follow rules of, like, a normal celebrity," he said. "I don't do publicity stunts. Period."
Five years later, Kimmel reflected on their beef in GQ. "I live for moments like that. When I got in a Twitter battle with Kanye, I was so happy. My wife makes fun of me. She's like, 'You are so happy right now,'" he said. "I'm absolutely beaming. I feel very confident in a situation like that."

Arnold Really Could Have Done Better With His Celebrity Apprentice Catchphrase
At least it's more clever than "You're fired."
By Matt Miller	
Jan 3, 2017
Now that Donald Trump has moved onto yet another important position that he's vastly unqualified for, NBC has conveniently rebooted Celebrity Apprentice starring another famous strongman (this one physically strong rather than strong in an authoritarian way) who also once managed to secure a political office. But you can rest easy knowing that Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot be President of the United States, as he was born in Austria. (That's how it's currently written in the Constitution, anyway.) His birthplace, however, has not stopped him from following Trump's footsteps in the hallowed grounds of reality television, which means, like any good showman, he needs a catchphrase.
While he shouldn't get any points for creativity, Trump did manage to weave the phrase "You're fired" into the cultural lexicon in a way that doesn't only fill you with terror and uncertainty for your future and personal finances. "You're fired" stands alongside "You are the weakest link" and "Is that your final answer?" as the most memorable turn-of-the-century reality TV catchphrases.
On Monday night, Schwarzenegger revealed his own catchphrase to some confusion. At the end of the first boardroom meeting, he told Carrie Keagan, "Carrie, you're terminated. Now, get to da choppa." But then at the second boardroom firing, he said to Carnie Wilson, "You're terminated. Hasta la vista, baby!" Get it?! Like from his movies!
But a catchphrase isn't about ungracefully shoving a series of unrelated movie references into a TV show about celebrities doing your bidding. Even Donald Trump knew that—and Donald Trump can't even spell! A catchphrase should be simple, and repetition is key! You can't change it every damn time! Is it going to be one from Kindergarten Cop next week? "If you don't stop screwing around back there, this is what I'm gonna do with you." [Breaks pencil]
Or, you know, come up with something original like, "What would you say you do here?"
Side note: Donald "Conflict of Interest" Trump's name appears as executive producer in the show's credits.
Welp. Trump's name did appear in the credits of the season premier of Celebrity Apprentice tonight... pic.twitter.com/AdJtEmAZlx

HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang, the country's second in command after the Communist party's leader, died Friday of a serious illness, the government said. He was 61.
The website statement said Quang passed away despite "utmost efforts to treat him by Vietnamese and foreign professors and doctors and care by the Party and State leaders." It said he died at the 108 Military Hospital in Hanoi but did not elaborate on his illness.
Quang hosted President Donald Trump during his first state visit to the communist country last year where Trump attended a summit of Pacific Rim leaders.
His last public appearance was at a Politburo meeting of the ruling Communist Party and a reception for a Chinese delegation on Wednesday. He looked frail on the state-run Vietnam Television broadcast.

Quang did not appear in public for more than a month last year, raising speculation about his health.
Born in northern Ninh Binh province, Quang attended a police college and rose through the ranks at various positions at the Ministry of Public Security before being appointed minister in 2011.
A career security officer and four-star general, Quang was elected president in April 2016 by the Communist-dominated National Assembly, effectively becoming the second most powerful man in the country after General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong.
The National Assembly is scheduled to convene a session next month and expected to elect a new president.

WATCH: Disney Pixar's new movie Inside Out reveals the chaotic mind of an eleven-year-old
DISNEY PIXAR'S latest blockbuster promises to introduce us to all the little voices that control our brains.

And if the latest clip is anything to go by, things can get pretty chaotic in the noggin of an eleven-year-old child… ESPECIALLY on the first day of school.
The minute long trailer show's Joy (Amy Poehler) micro-managing all the other emotions in main character Riley's brain.
Under her leadership Fear (Bill Hader) ensures he's ready for the worst possible outcome, Disgust (Mindy Kaling) makes sure Riley stands out from the crowd and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is given one important job – to stay inside the circle of sadness.
The film is set in the buzzing control centre of Riley's mind. When Riley's family relocates to a scary new city, the Emotions are on the job, eager to help guide her through the difficult transition.
DISNEY
Inside Out is set in the mind of eleven-year-old Riley
But when Joy and Sadness are inadvertently swept into the far reaches of Riley’s mind—taking some of her core memories with them—Fear, Anger and Disgust are left reluctantly in charge.
Joy and Sadness must venture through unfamiliar places—Long Term Memory, Imagination Land, Abstract Thought and Dream Productions—in a desperate effort to get back to Headquarters, and Riley.
Academy Award winning Pete Docter reunited with his team from Up for the film, which is set to premiere at he 68th annual Cannes Film Festival.
Speaking of the World Premiere, Pete said: "We are overjoyed at being included in this year's official selection at Cannes.
"With Inside Out, we spent years imagining – and then building – never-before-seen settings and characters within the mind. It was an incredible, fun and exciting challenge and now we can’t wait to share it with the world."

New guide to help businesses slash energy costs
 By Corporate Waste Solutions  2 June 2017
The Energy Efficiency Council (EEC) has launched a new guide that will help Australia’s manufacturers and commercial building owners take control of their energy costs.
The new ‘Quick Reference Guide to Energy Auditing’ gives businesses the information they need to work with energy efficiency experts to find ways of slashing their gas and electricity bills.
The Energy Efficiency Council is Australia’s peak body for energy efficiency, cogeneration and demand management. Formed in 2009, the Council is a not-for-profit membership association which exists to make sensible, cost effective energy efficiency measures standard practice across the Australian economy. It works on behalf of its members to promote stable government policy, provide clear information to energy users and drive the quality of energy efficiency products and services.
The EEC’s chief executive officer, Luke Menzel, says the launch of the guide is timely. “Businesses are grappling with massive energy price hikes, reliability issues and huge volatility in gas and electricity markets.”
“These price shocks pose an existential threat to energy intensive industries, and the market needs to be fixed. But in the meantime, taking advantage of cost effective energy productivity opportunities can give energy users some breathing space,” he says.
The Guide, launched at the Energy Users Association of Australia National Conference in Brisbane this week, was developed in partnership with the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. It is the first guide to step energy users though Australia’s new energy audit standard, released by Standards Australia in 2014.
Menzel says energy users had welcomed the Guide. “Businesses understand that getting more out of every unit of energy behind the meter is a way of reducing their exposure to the craziness playing out on the other side.”
“The ‘Quick Reference Guide to Energy Auditing’ will help them get the information they need to assess and invest in measures that quickly cut energy costs, and mitigate the risk of future price rises,” concludes Menzel.

Description
Although the signifi cance of the Internet has been widely discussed in previous studies, the research of e-commerce has focused primarily on organizational and business perspectives (Sigala 2004). The growing number of Internet users allows a better understanding of online tourists who seek travel information and book or purchase travel products. The levels of Internet innovativeness also must be understood, since research indicated that 79 percent of Internet users have had four or more years of online experience (The Pew Internet & American Life Project 2005). In this study, 273 respondents were classified as innovators, early adopters, or late adopters by the time element of the Internet diffusion process and compared based on their travel information search behaviors, booking/purchasing of travel products, intentions of using various types of travel information sources, and perceptions and current usage of Information Technology. There were differences among the groups in terms of general information seeking and booking/purchasing, and perceptions of information technologies, whereas similarities were found in certain types of tourism products sought and booked/purchased and actual usage of information technologies.

FTC Halts Cross Border Domain Name Registration Scam
FTC Halts Cross Border Domain Name Registration Scam
Thousands of Small Businesses and Non-profits Billed for Bogus Renewal Fees

Consumer Protection
The Federal Trade Commission has permanently halted the operations of Canadian con artists who allegedly posed as domain name registrars and convinced thousands of U.S. consumers, small businesses and non-profit organizations to pay bogus bills by leading them to believe they would lose their Web site addresses unless they paid. Settlement and default judgment orders signed by the court will bar the deceptive practices in the future.
In June 2008, the FTC charged Toronto-based Internet Listing Service with sending fake invoices to small businesses and others, listing the existing domain name of the consumer’s Web site or a slight variation on the domain name, such as substituting “.org” for “.com.” The invoices appeared to come from the businesses’ existing domain name registrar and instructed them to pay for an annual “WEBSITE ADDRESS LISTING.” The invoices also claimed to include a search engine optimization service. Most consumers who received the “invoices” were led to believe that they had to pay them to maintain their registrations of domain names. Other consumers were induced to pay based on Internet Listing Service’s claims that its “Search Optimization” service would “direct mass traffic” to their sites and that their “proven search engine listing service” would result in “a substantial increase in traffic.”
The FTC’s complaint charged that most consumers who paid the defendants’ invoices did not receive any domain name registration services and that the “search optimization” service did not result in increased traffic to the consumers’ Web sites.
A federal district court judge in Chicago, Robert M. Dow, Jr., ordered a temporary halt to the deceptive claims and froze the defendants’ assets, pending trial. The settlement and default judgment orders announced today end that litigation.
The orders bar the defendants from misrepresenting: that they have a preexisting business relationship with consumers; that consumers owe them money; that they will provide domain name registration; and that they will provide “search optimization services” that will substantially increase traffic to consumers’ Web sites. The defendants are also required to disclose any material restrictions or aspects of any goods or services they provide.
The settlement order, entered against defendants Isaac Benlolo, Kirk Mulveney, Pearl Keslassy, and 1646153 Ontario Inc., includes a suspended judgment of $4,261,876, the total amount of consumer injury caused by the illegal activities. Based on the inability of the settling defendants to pay, they will turn over $10,000 to satisfy the judgment. The default judgment order was entered against defendant Steven E. Dale and includes a judgment in the amount of $4,261,876.
Charges against Ari Balabanian and Data Business Solutions were dismissed by the court at the FTC’s request.
NOTE: Stipulated orders are for settlement purposes only and do not necessarily constitute an admission by the defendants of a law violation. Stipulated orders have the full force of law when signed by the judge.
The Federal Trade Commission works for the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, click http://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov or call 1-877-382-4357. The FTC enters Internet, telemarketing, identity theft, and other fraud-related complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to more than 1,800 civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. For free information on a variety of consumer topics, click http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/consumer.shtm.

When it comes to the security of a company’s website, most people think that the responsibility relies solely on the IT department. This couldn’t be further from the truth. In reality, every single person who has a login for your site, from admins to authors, all have a part to play in website security.
You don’t have to be a technology expert or a seasoned software coder to keep your website safe. Just by using the following tips, every team member who contributes to your website can assist with strengthening its security, no matter what their job role is in the organization.

I know, I know. You’ve already been preached to on the importance of a strong password. That hasn’t stopped people from using passwords like “123456,” “qwerty,” or any variant of “Pa$$w0rd!” So I’ll say it again, a strong password is vital.
Writing your password down on a piece of paper stuck to the back of the monitor is a no-no, too. But you knew that already, right?
“I’ll never remember a really long, complicated password,” is an argument I’ve heard several times. I have two recommendations to get around this.
Invest in a password manager. Consider setting up accounts with Last Pass, or my personal favorite, 1Password. With a password manager, having a 30+ character random password for a website is no problem. When it comes time to log in, you simply copy/paste it from your password manager rather than having to recall it from memory.
Use a passphrase. Maybe you prefer to keep your password memorized. That’s fine. But I urge you to consider using a passphrase. I tend to use full sentences comprised of song lyrics or a quote from a movie. For example, “Carry on my wayward son. For there’ll be peace when you are done.” or “You want the truth? You can’t handle the truth!”

Staying Protected While Using Public WIFI
When we travel, or even if we’re just working from the local coffee shop, we typically don’t think twice about connecting to the free WIFI and diving into work. While you may think it’s far fetched, having your login credentials stolen while on public WIFI is a very real possibility. And while there’s no way to 100% guarantee it’s not going to happen, one thing you can do to limit the risk of hacking is to make sure you are connected to your site using a secure connection.
In the screenshot above, the Chrome browser has displayed the word “Secure,” and the URL starts with https://. This lets us know that the website we’re browsing has a Secure certificate, and the data passed between the browser and the website’s server is being encrypted prior to being sent. If you do not see the word “Secure” and the URL starts with http://, data passed between the two is being done in plain text. If that’s the case, I would think twice about logging in over public WIFI, and encourage your IT team to set up an SSL Certificate right away.
Another option for those who frequently use public WIFI, you might want to consider investing in a VPN (Virtual Private Network).
Question Everything
Criminals, hackers, and ne’er-do-wells are always looking for new ways to steal sensitive data.
I’m sure you’ve heard the term phishing, and if you’re like me, you probably think that you’re too smart to fall for a phishing attack. But under the right set of circumstances, I don’t care how careful you are, it can happen to any one of us. Don’t think so? Check out this post and let me know if this makes you think otherwise.

Not all security attacks happen online. In one of my favorite books, The Art of Deception, the author explains the art of Social Engineering and how it can be used to trick somebody into simply handing over their login credentials. Again I say, if you don’t think it can happen to you, I strongly suggest you read the book.
Keeping your website safe and secure is a team effort. Staying on your toes and always being alert is the key!

Furnaces and Heating
Griffin Heating & Air Conditioning technicians are experienced with heating and furnace systems in Salisbury, NC. Are you looking to purchase a new furnace or upgrade your current heating system to run more efficiently? We can determine which furnace is right for your home. This is very important, as a furnace that is too small or too large won’t operate at an efficient level, placing extra strain on the unit and costing you money!

Indoor Air Quality
Between work and home life, the average person spends about 90% of their time indoors! Indoor air can be 2 to 5 times more polluted than outside air. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency ranked indoor air quality as a top 5 environmental danger.
A well-insulated home can help with your energy bills by keeping a constant temperature but that also leads to the same air being recycled through your home each time your air conditioner or furnace run. Be sure you have proper filtration in place to prevent allergens and bacteria from circulating around your air.
Griffin Heating & Air Conditioning can help you breathe easy. Call us today at 704-873-1749 and we can put together a plan for your home!
Learn more about Indoor Air Quality.
Humidifiers and Dehumidifiers
The comfort of your home not only depends on the air temperature but also the amount of moisture in the air. Cold weather typically means dry, uncomfortable air. Dry air can cause respiratory problems as well as damage wooden furniture. Whole home humidifiers emit water vapor to increase the humidity in your home.
On the other hand, hot weather can mean thick, humid air. This can lead to condensation on your windows, mold spots on walls or ceilings, blistering paint or peeling wallpaper, just to list a few issues. A whole home dehumidifier removes excess moisture from the air in your home.
Let the professionals at Griffin Heating & Air Conditioning help you decide what’s best for your home!
Learn more about Humidifiers and Dehumidifiers.
Water Heaters
Griffin Heating & Air Conditioning is happy to offer our Salisbury, NC customers two options when it comes to water heaters.
Many people are familiar with the traditional water heater. It works by storing water in a tank and keeping it heated to a preset temperature.
Tankless water heaters are a new idea to many people. How does it work? As the name implies, there is no tank to store water. Instead, water is heated on an as-needed basis. A couple of the key benefits of a tankless water heater are that you are not heating water until it’s needed and you won’t run out of hot water.
Let the water heater professionals at Griffin Heating & Air Conditioning help you determine which type of water heater is best for your situation.
Learn more about Water Heaters.
Air Ducts
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Star program, leaky ducts in attics or crawlspaces can account for 20% or more of a home’s heating and cooling energy losses. This makes it difficult to keep your house comfortable and it can result in higher utility bills.
Some signs that you may have leaky ducts include:
High summer and winter utility bills
Rooms that are difficult to heat and cool
Stuffy rooms that never seem to feel comfortable
Ducts are located in an attic, crawlspace, or the garage
Tangled or kinked flexible ducts in your system
Learn more about how you can prevent, detect, and fix air duct issues with the help of the professionals at Griffin Heating & Air Conditioning. Find out more about duct testing, duct insulation, and duct sizing as they relate to and impact indoor air quality.
Contact us 704-873-1749 or request service online today.
Learn more about Air Ducts.

Hillary Clinton, The OG Nasty Woman, Finally Sports A Nasty Woman T-Shirt
The shirt promotes Samantha Bee's Planned Parenthood fundraiser.
By Lauren Alexis Fisher	
Jul 11 2017, 3:48 pm EDT
Twitter @HillaryClinton	
Unless you just woke up from a year-long coma (in which case, go back to sleep), you probably remember last October when Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman" at the third and final presidential debate. Sparking a movement across the globe as a call-to-action, the derogatory comment was instantly embraced and turned into T-shirts raising money for Planned Parenthood. Now, Clinton herself is officially sporting the "Nasty Woman" T-shirt, too.
The original Nasty Woman took to Twitter today to show off her new tee supporting Samantha Bee's fundraiser for Planned Parenthood.
Support Samantha Bee & Planned Parenthood & buy a Nasty Woman t-shirt!https://t.co/I9qd3M3cFq pic.twitter.com/XDpBcFqF7k
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 11, 2017
Proceeds from the black and white T-shirt, which retails for $25, go towards Planned Parenthood Advocacy Project Los Angeles County, protecting women's rights and access to healthcare.
In the midst of the latest Trump drama unraveling at the moment, a picture of Clinton in a "Nasty Woman" shirt is the welcome escape we've been waiting for.

Michael Cohen Speaks: Trump Exec Admits Russia Dealings Were Gross, But Not Illegal
Plus: The three times he spoke with Trump about a potential Moscow deal.
By Vicky Ward
Michael Cohen isn’t really supposed to be talking to reporters. The former executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization, who also serves as the personal attorney to the president, sat in the back of the bustling Hampton Coffee Company in the tony beach town of Water Mill, New York, on Tuesday, nursing a large black coffee. His two cellphones beeped every few seconds. Eventually he looked down at the offending devices. “There goes CNN again,” he said. “Friends and my attorney have recommended I not appear on air until after my testimony.”
There was certainly good reason for his lawyers to advise caution. This week has seen Cohen, 51, take another star turn in the ongoing Russia investigation. Cohen (and President Donald Trump) have insisted for more than a year that the Trump Organization has had no business dealings in Russia. Cohen has been one of the president’s most dogged defenders in the media on that point, taking his case to TV, Twitter ― anywhere, basically. Speaking to the Financial Times in December, he dismissed the idea of “any connection with Russia” as “yet another example of the press’s liberal bias towards Mr. Trump.”

Attorney Michael Cohen arrives at Trump Tower in New York, Jan. 12, 2017.
But earlier this week, details of a planned business deal with Russia emerged in the press, partly because Cohen’s lawyer filed a two-page statement ahead of Cohen’s upcoming appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. (The hearing, originally scheduled for Sept. 5, has been postponed.) The statement reveals that in 2015 and 2016, Cohen was pursuing a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The deal was brought to him by Felix Sater, a freelance Russian-American broker, convicted criminal and former FBI informant who’d worked with the Trump Organization on several previous projects.
Sater said he could lasso a Russian partner for the proposed Moscow deal, and he pursued one with customary brio. In a November 2015 email, Sater told Cohen, who he has known for 30 years, that he would “get all of Putins [sic] team to buy in on this.” He added, “Our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it.”
But that wasn’t all. According to his statement, Cohen talked about the proposed project with Trump himself on three separate occasions during the course of the campaign. Cohen also admitted that in mid-January 2016, he sent an email to Dmitry Peskov, a senior member of the Kremlin, asking where the government stood on approvals for the tower. He said he didn’t hear back, and the project never got off the ground.
This goes against Cohen’s earlier claim that Trump had no connection to Russia “altogether,” not to mention Trump’s own blanket denial from February: “I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person I deal with does.”
I asked Cohen how it feels to be caught in a contradiction. “I feel great,” he said. “Which picture did The Wall Street Journal use of me? Was it good?” He continued: “I am in many respects just like the president. Nothing seems to rattle me, no matter how bad the hate.”
As Cohen sees it, he is simply “collateral damage,” a victim of the general ill will toward Trump supporters like himself. As proof, he showed me an email on one of his phones from someone claiming to be an entertainment executive in Los Angeles. “Your a dick,” the email began, and escalated from there, with the sender threatening to molest Cohen’s girlfriend. (Cohen is married.)
He told me that he gets a lot of emails and calls like this. Still, his mood lightened when a man at the coffee shop approached us. The man said that he and Cohen grew up in the same neighborhood, and praised Cohen’s TV appearances. “You are Howard Stern meets Tony Robbins meets Ari from ‘Entourage,’” the man said. Cohen chuckled. “You can write that if you want,” he told me.
I showed him a tweet from John Podhoretz, editor of the magazine Commentary: “Nothing illegal about Trump & people kissing up to Putin while running for Prez, even if for biz reasons. Gross but not illegal.”
“Well, he’s right,” Cohen replied calmly. “Though I would argue that neither I nor Trump were kissing up to Putin for either political or business benefits. The Trump Moscow project was a proposal that came to me through Felix from a Russian real estate developer. The fact that it needed government approval from the Kremlin is irrelevant. Putin was not the partner. He is the president of the country.”
But if Trump needed the Kremlin to approve a major deal, wouldn’t that have created the possibility of undue influence? “No,” Cohen said. “Their system is different from ours. The Kremlin has to approve buildings in Moscow. That’s not undue influence. That’s just the way it is.”
I point out that for many people, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between Trump’s business interests and his political ones. And yet Cohen told me that during the campaign there had been no internal conversations at the Trump Organization about how to avoid potential conflicts of interest. “Everything was being characterized as a potential conflict,” he said. “On CNN, they argued that unless Trump sold everything, there would be a conflict of interest. My comment [to them] was that even if he sold every asset, they’d attack the buyer as having undue influence over him. It’s the epitome of Catch-22.”
Did the Trump Organization’s stance change when reports started to emerge that Russia was attempting to interfere with the election? “No,” Cohen said, “because we had no involvement in it. We had the same information as the public.”
How, then, does he explain Sater’s email gloating that the Moscow deal would help “our boy” with the campaign? “Trump getting elected would have just been a bonus [of the deal] in my mind,” Cohen said. “Felix knew that. He was selling me. What Felix was referring to was that [the tower] would distinguish Trump from the other 16 candidates by showing his ability to get along with foreign leaders who have not been well received by the previous administration.”
Later, he added: “I think it’s essential that the U.S. and Russia work together as superpowers in order to bring stability to the world. This is why the U.S. people elected Donald Trump.”
Throughout our conversation, Cohen maintained that Trump was barely aware of the details of what would have been a “very, very lucrative” project, if it had gone ahead. He gave me an account of the precise numbers of minutes, and even words, that Trump expended on the effort. According to Cohen, when he first brought up the Moscow deal to his boss, he received a two-word response: “He said: ’OK, great.”
The second conversation, Cohen said, was in the fall of 2015, when he asked Trump to sign a nonbinding letter of intent to go out to potential Russian partners. “This meeting lasted approximately two minutes,” Cohen said. The third exchange happened in January 2016: “I stated to Mr. Trump, while talking about something else, that I terminated the agreement. His response was another two words ― ‘Too bad.’”
And so, Cohen concluded, “the entire duration of our conversations on Trump Tower Moscow, if you added them all up, lasted four minutes.”
I told him it’s difficult to understand why Cohen and Trump had denied having any dealings in Russia, if all these conversations were so innocuous. Cohen nodded. Some of it, he said, has to do with lawyers wanting to control the narrative. And some of it, he said, is just plain absurd. He claims that when he sent the email to Peskov, he had little idea whom he was actually reaching out to. By his account, he wanted to find whether the Russian government had authorized the Moscow tower. At Sater’s suggestion, he says, he looked Peskov up. “I sent my email addressed to Peskov to a general mailbox ― not his personal email, which I never had. I did not hear back from him.”
Cohen characterizes this contact as “tantamount to sending an email to [White House chief of staff] General [John] Kelly by sending the communication to ‘info@WH.org.’ It is certainly not in the Spy 101 Handbook for Stealth.”
This wasn’t the only episode that Cohen attempted to justify with an explanation that might have been a plot out of “Monty Python.” There was also his alleged effort, in February, to help broker peace in Ukraine with politician Andrey Artemenko. This was controversial because Artemenko said that he had won Putin’s backing for his plan, and Cohen allegedly delivered the proposal to Michael Flynn, who was fired from his post as national security adviser one week later.
Cohen claims that this encounter was blown out of proportion. “Felix asked that I meet him for a cup of coffee, as he wanted to introduce me to a friend,” he said, referring to Artemenko. Cohen suggested the Loews Regency near New York’s Central Park “because it is two blocks from my house and they have good coffee.”
There, Cohen said, Artemenko told him that he was going to run for president of Ukraine and that he knew how to solve the conflict between Russia and Crimea. “His plan, which was one that is not novel nor unique, was for the Ukraine to lease Crimea to Russia for 100 years. That was the whole plan,” Cohen said. “He asked if I could deliver a paper to either the president or General Flynn. He gave me a long brown envelope containing one or two pages. I never opened it and I never delivered it to either General Flynn or the president. I told him to send it to General Flynn at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He asked me to take a copy in case I saw them... But I didn’t deliver it, because I had no interest in what he was selling.”
So, why the conflicting accounts about his role? Cohen raised his hands. “I really don’t want to go into it,” he said, “except Reince Priebus later confirmed no document was ever given.” (Priebus, Trump’s former chief of staff, did not respond to requests for comment.)
“The whole thing is so stupid,” he continued. “When was the last time you saw a peace proposal on one piece of paper? SAT computations for algebraic equations take at least two pages or more. I truly hope at the end of all this nonsense that some L.A. screenwriter elects to turn this into a Netflix miniseries or movie called ‘Sheer Nonsense.’”
He waited a beat. “And I really hope Tom Cruise plays me.”

Astrologers Say Celestial Charts Favor Obama Over Mitt Romney
Reuters
By Kathy Finn
NEWS ORLEANS, May 29 (Reuters) - The votes are in and it is unanimous: Barack Obama will win re-election to the U.S. presidency in November, according to five astrologers who offered predictions at their convention on Tuesday.
Each of the five astrologers on the presidential panel explained how they came to their assessments, with most relying on studies of celestial charts pertinent to both Obama and presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney for the date of either the election itself or the next presidential inauguration.
For Chicago astrologist and corporate lawyer Nina Gryphon, it was her study of the Aries ingress - the exact time when the Sun enters the sign of Aries - that clinched the decision. "It's obvious," she said. "Obama stays where he is without a change in status."
Billed as a meeting of the world's top astrologers, the conference in New Orleans drew some 1,500 people who participated in workshops and panel discussions.
Not to be confused with astronomy, the scientific study of the physical universe, astrology uses non-scientific methods to predict how the relative positions of celestial bodies may influence human behavior and future events.
Denver astrologer Chris Brennan said his chart study focused on public profiles of the two presidential candidates, both of whom "are entering into peak periods of eminence in the next few months." But he said there was a key difference: "Obama's peak period stays consistent throughout the election, whereas Romney's seems to falter a few weeks before the election," he said.
Most of the panelists placed a high degree of certainty on their forecast, but a few pointed to potential difficulties Obama may face after his predicted re-election.
"The ingress of Saturn into Scorpio may trouble him," Brennan said. "It won't cost him the election, but it may indicate difficulties in the first half of his second term."
Brennan could not specify the potential problem, but "it pertains to his career and his reputation," he said.
As to the election itself, Brennan raised the possibility of the contested 2000 election being revisited.
"We should all be aware of the Mercury retrograde that will occur on election day," he said, referring to an optical illusion that can make a planet appear to reverse direction temporarily.
"Most astrologers are pretty certain that this could cause problems similar to what happened in the 2000 election," Brennan said, referring to the contested Florida vote that was settled only when the Supreme Court ruled that George W. Bush should be president rather than Al Gore.
The retrograde, Brennan said, "seems to imply that there's something up in the air about the election until sometime later in the month."
"It's possible it won't be finished for Romney until the last week of November," he said.
Two of the panelists participated in a similar session four years ago when the panel also gave a unanimous thumbs-up to Obama.	(Reporting By Greg McCune; Editing by Eric Walsh)

Assistant Professor of Sociology, Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs
Jennifer Karas Montez received her PhD in Sociology with a Demography specialization at the University of Texas at Austin in 2011. Afterwards she spent two years at the Harvard School of Public Health as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholar, and then two years at Case Western Reserve University as an Assistant Professor of Sociology. Her research examines the large and growing inequalities in adult mortality across education levels and geographic areas within the United States. She is particularly interested in why the growing inequalities have been most troublesome among women. Her current work on this topic blends perspectives from social demography and feminist geography to investigate the role of U.S. states in shaping women’s and men’s mortality in unique ways. In another line of research she examines whether and why experiences in childhood, such as poverty and abuse, have enduring consequences for health during later life.

Putin as Energy Tsar: Russian Gas Outflanks U.S. Missiles
09/14/2008 05:12 am ET Updated May 25, 2011
"This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, where Russia can threaten a neighbor, occupy a capital, overthrow a government and get away with it." Condoleezza Rice, August 13, 2008.
Oh really? What will Rice do to make sure Russia does not get away with it? And who in the media will call Condi's bluff? After squandering so much in terms of lives, treasure, and credibility, this administration has turned America into a paper tiger. Our country lacks the resources to stand up to Russian aggression. While Russia has the resources to bend its neighbors to its will.
The rest of the world gets it. Russia is the world's largest oil and gas producer by far. Its combined oil and natural gas production, on an energy-equivalent basis, is almost twice as large as Saudi Arabia's. More to the point, Russia produces 30% of all natural gas in the eastern hemisphere. And Putin is more than willing to use natural gas as a political weapon.
This is why France and Germany opposed the U.S. proposal to admit the Ukraine or Georgia into NATO last spring. And that is why the rest of the world has been muted in its criticism of Russia's actions against Georgia.
Putin regrets the breakup of the former Soviet Union, and he is strengthening Russia's energy alliance with its neighbors and with Iran. Together, the former Soviet Union and Iran represent 45% of all natural gas production in the eastern hemisphere.
In January 2006, Russia suddenly stopped selling gas to the Ukraine, which had elected a government less friendly to Russia. The three-day impasse had regional implications because most of Russia's gas destined for western Europe must be shipped through a pipeline that crosses the Ukraine, and gas shortages were felt throughout the EU.
But soon, Russia will be able to punish the Ukraine without inflicting collateral damage on itself or others. Russia will then have a chokehold over Europe's natural gas that compares to the Standard Oil monopoly of the late 19th century. By 20011, the Nordstream Pipeline, which will move gas under the Baltic from Russia to Germany, and the Blue Stream Pipeline which will move gas under the Black Sea from Russia to Turkey, are both scheduled to be completed. Like John D. Rockefeller 120 years earlier, Russia will soon be in a position to tell anyone, "We can do without you, but you can't do without us."
We've already seen how Russia uses its resources to thwart U.S. moves against Iran. A few weeks ago, after Shell and Total announced they would not move forward with new investments in Iran's South Pars field, Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, announced that it wished to expand its oil and gas development in Iran.
Last October, Putin met with his neighbors to sort a longstanding impasse over mineral rights underneath the Caspian Sea, where an estimated 257 trillion cubic feet in natural gas reserves have yet to be developed. Prior to 1991, those claims were divided 50/50 between the Soviet Union and Iran. Today three new countries, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan also touch the Caspian.
At the meeting, held in Teheran, Putin sent a message aimed, not only at the United States, but also at Turkmenistan which allows U.S. military transport planes to refuel en route to Afghanistan, and Azerbaijan where the U.S. financed improvements to a former Soviet airfield. "We should not even think of making use of force in this region," said Putin. All five nations agreed that none would allow their territories to be used as a base for military strikes against any of the others. Putin also told Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that he desired for deeper relations between the countries.
This November, ministers from the major gas exporting countries will meet in Moscow to discuss the formation of a gas OPEC, an idea that Iran has been promoting for years.

Burrito Boyz Serves Hot Meals To Homeless People In San Diego
They've provided more than 132,000 meals to people in need.
By Kimberly Yam
Here’s an initiative that’s stuffed with compassion.
Every week, kids, teens and young adults gather together to make hundreds of burritos for the homeless in San Diego, as part of organization Burrito Boyz.
Burrito Boyz
Since starting the group in 2010, they’ve served over 132,000 meals. Michael Johnson, who founded the organization with his family, told The Huffington Post that the initiative aims to extend a caring hand to a community while teaching gratitude and empathy in the process.
“It’s just bringing hope, dignity and respect to a community that gets very little of it,” Johnson explained. “And by working with the community ... it makes every person that comes and volunteers with us, a little more appreciative of what they have.”

The original crew of Burrito Boyz.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, San Diego has the fourth largest homeless population among major cities in the countries. It’s this community that the Burrito Boyz tries to serve and help.
Johnson told HuffPost that the burrito-making process starts as early as 4:30 a.m. every Sunday, with him throwing potatoes into the oven to cook. Other adults come in at different intervals to prepare ingredients and just before 7 a.m., the kids and young adults, who are mostly between the ages of 10 and 18, arrive to assemble the egg, cheese and potato burritos.
Each Sunday session yields over 600 burritos and Johnson explained that by serving burritos, the group is able to provide hot food to those in need.
Burrito Boyz’s generosity doesn’t stop with the cooking, either. The group drives and sets up shop in two areas downtown to distribute the food. In addition to the burritos, they also provide feminine hygiene products, toiletries, pet food, healthy snacks for kids, books and even a resource guide that describes different programs and services available for people in need.
While the group does a lot to give back, there’s also another awesome byproduct of their work. Johnson noted that their Sunday activities have brought about lasting, meaningful connections. In fact, some of those who have benefited from the Burrito Boyz’s service have come back to help with the volunteer efforts after getting off the streets.
“[Serving] the burrito is like when you have guests over to your house for a meal ― that’s how you start relationships,”Johnson said. “The meal allows the relationships to happen.”

Why Is CNN Giving Steve Bannon A 60-Minute Infomercial?

When Fareed Zakaria announced via Twitter on Thursday night, “CNN Exclusive – A Fareed Zakaria Special: The Steve Bannon Interview,” the hype machine went into full gear. CNN began teasing excerpts of the interview, to air the following night in primetime for an entire hour, promising Bannon’s perspective on everything from Donald Trump to Robert Mueller to the midterm elections.
My first thought was, “This must be one explosive interview.” Why else would CNN devote an entire hour to an interview with someone who has been in exile abroad since his very public break with both the president and Breitbart News in January? Would Bannon turn on Trump? Would he renew his crusade against the Washington political establishment? Did he have a new venture to announce that would thrust him back into the center of the national political conversation?
I watched the interview from the CNN bureau in Washington. I had been booked to appear on “CNN Tonight” with Don Lemon after the Bannon interview aired to give reaction and analysis. The more I watched, the more agitated I became. This wasn’t an interview, it was an infomercial.
Bannon declared that the president of the United States is also the country’s “chief law enforcement officer” and should consider firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He praised Trump as “great,” and while he “respectfully” disagreed with the president on his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he heaped effusive praise on his former boss’ approach to trade and immigration. Bannon even suggested that Trump would shut down the government in the fall over funding for the border wall.
One thing was clear, Bannon wasn’t going to break with Trump. This interview had one purpose for an audience of one. It’s an obvious strategy. Trump hate-watches CNN but also craves acceptance from the “mainstream media.” Trump’s entire decision-making process often seems solely based on what he watches on television. Trump believes there are not enough voices on cable TV defending him. Steve Bannon appears on “fake news” CNN, knowing Trump is watching, and offers a spirited defense of his presidency, all the while hoping the appearance helps him return to Trump’s good graces.
It makes a lot of sense if you’re Steve Bannon. It makes zero sense for CNN.
The entire time I’m watching this infomercial, I’m wondering, “Why the hell is CNN giving Steve Bannon an hour to try and rehabilitate his relationship with Donald Trump?” It makes even less sense than repeatedly inviting Kellyanne Conway on air to give blatantly misleading or meaningless explanations of administration policy (most of us call them lies). The reality is, reporters and producers play a tangible role in elevating and empowering different voices to shape the national discourse in this country. How the media chooses to wield that power is incredibly consequential.
If there is a path for Bannon to return to prominence and influence, it runs through the media. Past experience and the ascension of Donald Trump makes Bannon believe the media will do his work for him. He doesn’t believe that any reporter or booking producer would ever turn down a quote or interview opportunity with him.
I always felt that the worst thing you could do to Steve Bannon and Donald Trump is to not talk about them. To not give them additional oxygen to fuel their venom. Silence is their true fear. For all the bluster about “fake news” and media bias, Bannon and Trump would be nothing without them. Now Bannon is relying on the media to try and give him yet another lease on life. The only question is, will the media be a willing accomplice to Bannon’s rehabilitation effort?
If what we saw on CNN Friday night is any indication, the answer is clearly a resounding yes.

Robert Scheer has built a reputation for strong social and political writing over his 30 years as a journalist.
Robert Rosenthal: Investigative Journalism Must Embrace Tech
08/05/2017 03:33 pm ET Updated Aug 05, 2017

Robert Rosenthal knows groundbreaking journalism. The award-winning reporter, now the executive director of The Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR), was working at The New York Times when it published the Pentagon Papers, and he tells Robert Scheer about his experience with leaks and “fake news” in this week’s episode of KCRW’s “Scheer Intelligence.”
“The adversarial relationship between journalism in this country and power has existed [for decades],” he tells Scheer, “and governments will use, abuse and spin information and hope they don’t get caught.”
The interview begins with a discussion of Rosenthal’s long history in journalism. He became interested in the field at a young age because his father was a renowned journalism professor. Rosenthal later worked as executive editor for The Philadelphia Inquirer and then as managing editor for the San Francisco Chronicle. He explains how, after years at various publications, he became “fed up with corporate media and the inability to really, I think, grab the opportunity of the internet.”
This led Rosenthal to The Center for Investigative Reporting, where he became executive director in 2008. He says he is proud of the CIR for helping to “create a new model” of storytelling on the internet.
“The simple way I describe it is, if you think of a wheel ... in the center of that wheel is the story. But build a news organization where every spoke is a different platform, a different way to tell a story,” he tells Scheer. “So you embrace the technology, and deliver storytelling to people in ways they’re most comfortable with.”
The two discuss the need for more successful business models for investigative journalism, as well as the rise of fake news. “There’s great reporting being done, and yet,” Scheer says, “the basic journalistic model is broken.”
Rosenthal agrees, noting that there is a vast difference “between media and journalism.”
“Whether you want to call it fake news, propaganda, distortion,” Rosenthal says, “these are all very dangerous tools that really are accelerated and weaponized in the age of the internet.”
After Scheer notes that more media outlets are finally beginning to challenge White House narratives now that Donald Trump is in office, Rosenthal responds: “The best journalists challenge that. But they’ve also been part of that system. ... It’s quite seductive to be covering the president of the United States. ... there’s a coziness that I’ve always thought was uncomfortable.”

Evacuation of Superdome continues amid tension, chaos | Idaho Statesman
Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a total evacuation of New Orleans and proclaimed the legendary Southern city uninhabitable after Katrina stormed across the Gulf Coast on Monday with winds up to 145 mph. Nagin predicted the death toll could reach into the thousands.
In a statement read on CNN, Nagin issued a "desperate SOS" for more food and buses.
"Right now we are out of resources at the (Ernest N. Morial) Convention Center and don't anticipate enough buses," he said, speaking of another place sheltering refugees. "Currently the Convention Center is unsanitary and unsafe and we are running out of supplies for 15,000 to 25,000 people."
Thousands left New Orleans before the storm, but as many as 100,000 stayed behind, including some 15,000 to 25,000 mostly poor residents who sought refuge in the Superdome.
In neighboring Texas, Gov. Rick Perry offered to house 25,000 refugees in Houston, 25,000 in Dallas-Fort Worth and 25,000 in San Antonio. Arrangements were still in flux for accommodations in Dallas, but San Antonio officials were readying the Joe Freeman Coliseum, an air-conditioned arena near the SBC Center, home of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team. Officials estimated that refugees had taken up 45,000 Houston-area hotel rooms in addition to the Astrodome.
Evacuees from the Superdome, including many who'd arrived at the shelter on Sunday, walked Thursday from the building through an adjacent mall and then through the ground-floor concourse of a downtown hotel. Then they walked through a foot of water to get on buses that would take them to the Astrodome.
"Where are we going?" Denise Honore asked, her arms wrapped around the waists of her 8- and 15-year-old daughters.
People grew frantic in the morning heat as they waited on the elevated plaza. They raised their hands, hoping that their families would be chosen to go next. Soldiers and police passed out bottles of water and small containers of chocolate pudding, which children scooped out with their fingers.
Most people were wearing and carrying their only remaining possessions, some in tattered cardboard boxes on the tops of their heads.
"We'll go wherever they can bring us," said Jane Seaton, who was one of 17 people who'd been rescued from the roof of her home after the storm. "I'm a nurse, I can work anywhere."
The buses left almost as quickly as they arrived. They filled and left so fast that Louisiana Army National Guard Col. Thomas Beron and the officials overseeing the evacuation weren't sure how many had left by midafternoon.
But with 40 people on each bus, the flow was a mere trickle.
Conditions were so bad in the Superdome that most people milled around the exterior concourse, waiting to get out. Someone had started a small fire inside, and the smoke puffed out in an odious fog. Feces and garbage littered the area around the dome. People sat on the ground, leaning against stinking piles of trash bags.
The toilets inside had stopped working days ago, and people had nowhere to go to the bathroom outside. The National Guard allowed a few elderly people to squat over bedpans behind one of their trucks. Mothers had to ration diapers by letting them reach maximum saturation before changing them.
Some people didn't wait for the buses. Keith Berry, 42, and a friend left the Superdome around 8 a.m. and waded through 3 feet of water to see whether they could exit a parking garage nearby, where they'd been storing a car. They found a clear route out to Loyola Street, the same exit route the evacuation buses were using.
Some, such as Vonsheila Smith, said they'd given up on their hometown and hoped to begin a new life in Houston—or somewhere else.
"Wherever we go, we're going with nothing and we're starting over," Smith said. "We know we're not coming back."
Throngs of residents, all bearing tales of desperation, crowded a Mississippi River bridge as they fled their stricken city on foot. Others struggled to reach the Superdome and one of the buses that could carry them to safety.
"Our roof caved in four days ago. We've got mosquitoes, roaches, rats, everything. It's crazy," said Charles Burton, 23, who was accompanying his pregnant 17-year-old sister. "The police passed by us—they say we're supposed to evacuate. How? We don't have a car."
W.C. Clanton, 67, a former postal worker, had fled his home in the Gentilly section of New Orleans on Tuesday when the water began rising. His destination? "Wherever," he said. "I just want to get out of Dodge."
Throughout the day, large touring buses spilled into the parking lots of Houston's Astrodome. Only 2,000 cots had been arrayed on the Astrodome floor, leaving many without a place to lie down. But most of the newcomers, still shaken by the catastrophe to the east, welcomed their new accommodations.
"There's so much chaos down there," said James Hollins, a resident of New Orleans who took his pregnant girlfriend and 3-year-old daughter through waist-high water from their home to the Superdome. "You imagine it would be bad—just not this bad."

This is a legal agreement between you and I Say Organic Pvt. Ltd. (ISOPL), i.e. the company which is the licensed owner of the brand “I Say Organic” and the website www.ISayOrganic.com".
1) Membership Eligibility
Use of the Website is limited to persons who can form legally binding contracts under Indian Contract Act, 1872. Persons who are "incompetent to contract" within the meaning of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 including minors, un-discharged insolvents etc. are not eligible to use the Website. If you are a minor, i.e. under the age of 18 years, and wish to use or transact on the Site, such use must be made with the consent and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these terms and conditions, and transactions must be made by your legal guardian or parents on the Site.
2) ISOPL Service
The ISOPL Service is a transaction, information and communication service available to authorized users ("customers") who access ISayOrganic.com. ISayOrganic.com currently provides an online shopping and delivery service for organic vegetable, fruits, and other groceries, and may in the future provide additional shopping and related services.
ISOPL’s employees, agents or designees will deliver the orders placed on the Site, or through another medium like telephone. ISOPL sells products under the “I Say Organic” brand, and may also in future sell products of other companies sold under their respective brand. Prices of the “I Say Organic” branded products, which includes all fresh produce i.e. fruits and vegetables, sold on the Site are set by ISOPL. Prices of products of other companies will be sold at MRP unless otherwise specified. Delivery will be made to the delivery address that you specify when you confirm your order. Prices for products you place in your cart will be guaranteed for the transaction. Payment for your order and delivery fees, if any, is due at the time of delivery, if not already paid for through an online payment. You are responsible for ensuring that someone is present at the delivery address to receive and pay for deliveries at the specified time of delivery. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive and pay for the order. If ISOPL cannot deliver your order, or must make an additional delivery because no one is at the delivery address to receive and pay for the order at the specified time, or wrong address / details given to us by you, you might be assessed an additional fee. If you are not satisfied for any reason with an item purchased through the ISOPL Service, you may email feedback@ISayOrganic.com or call customer service on 011-41087447 at the time of receiving your order. ISOPL's liability for missing a delivery is limited to delivery at a later agreed time at no additional charge.
(a) Pricing: All the products listed on ISayOrganic.com will be sold at MRP unless otherwise specified. The prices mentioned at the time of placing an order are the applicable prices. Prices of non perishable products do not fluctuate on a daily basis but those of many perishables can change on a daily basis which would be updated almost immediately on the portal.
(b) Cancellation Policy: You as a customer can cancel your order anytime up to the cut-off time of the slot for which you have placed an order by calling our customer service. In such a case we will refund any payments already made by you for the order. If we suspect any fraudulent transaction by any customer or any transaction which defies the terms & conditions of using the website, we at our sole discretion could cancel such orders. We will maintain a negative list of all fraudulent transactions and customers and would deny access to them or cancel any orders placed by them. However, if there are changes in the delivery slot time you requested or need to add more products, you need to edit your order by logging into your account on the Site, or call customer care on 011-41087447.
(c) Return & Refunds: At the time of delivery, you can return whatever you are not happy with and we will make the necessary adjustments to your order value. However, please note, if a product is returned due to a change in mind and your order value goes below our minimum order requirement, you will be assessed an additional delivery fee. In case you have already paid for the returned item previously (through an online transaction, or subscription), a credit will be offered for future transactions. For a particular item, a partial return is not possible. For instance, if you are unhappy with 2 pieces of cucumber out of 5, you will have to return all 5 pieces.
For complaints we receive after the delivery pertaining to quality issues, a credit will be offered for the next delivery. Complaints received after 3 days of delivery for fresh produce (fruits and vegetables) will be handled on a case by case basis. This is because some more perishable or tender vegetables don't have a shelf life greater than that. We guarantee freshness at the time of delivery, so we encourage people to send in complaints ideally at the time of delivery, or else soon after, so that refunds/credits can be easily processed.
There are a few characteristics of organic produce that need to be accepted by customers. In cases where a customer does not acknowledge this, he/she has the option of returning the products at the time of delivery, however refunds or credit after payment will not be accepted. The following are some examples:
Produce might be unevenly shaped, might not be very shiny or big. But it should be good inside. Organic is not about perfect looks, and doesn't rely on artificial growth promoters or chemicals to enhance physical appeal. The vegetables look like nature intended them to. This might be very apparent in cases of things like apples, which otherwise are infamous for heavy chemical and wax use (to make them look pretty), while in some cases the vegetables will look no different than a chemically grown vegetable There might be slight variations in color, size, and taste over the season of the vegetable. Again, it is because the characteristics of the vegetable can change with the weather.
On rare occasions, customers find a bug or 2 inside a vegetable. We are not referring to a big bug that has eaten a chunk of a vegetable, but a small bug inside a cucumber, or a piece of okra or brinjal. This is actually proof it is organic! A simple solution is to cut away the infested part and use the rest. To be safe, you can boil the vegetable well.

Protected Areas as Solutions for Climate Change
Fri, 16 Oct 2009
Protected area systems provide powerful tools to combat climate change; with commitment and planning they could do even more in the future. This story is shared with CEC by Nigel Dudley and Trevor Sandwith of the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas.

Global climate change strategies identify the need to halt deforestation and to use natural ecosystems for sequestering carbon, as well as to help society adapt to the changes that are occurring. Protected areas can play a key role; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes: “Synergies between mitigation and adaptation can exist, e.g. properly designed biomass production, formation of protected areas…” (our emphasis). Recognition of ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will give important support for this strategy.
Protected areas can help in two ways: mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon in organic matter and adapting to impacts of climate change by maintaining ecosystem functioning and the services upon which millions of people depend.
Over 312 gigatonnes of carbon is already stored in protected areas according to the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), or 15 per cent of global carbon stocks. This may prove to be an underestimate, as we learn more about sequestration in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Protected areas are important particularly where habitat destruction would otherwise cause carbon loss. Economists can calculate the value of carbon: research by The Nature Conservancy found that carbon in protected areas in Bolivia, Venezuela and Mexico was worth US$39-87 billion in global damage costs avoided.
As climate change progresses, healthy natural ecosystems can help buffer human societies. Natural disasters are growing in number and severity, from about 100 major disasters per decade in the 1940s to almost 2,800 in the 1990s, because extreme climatic events are increasing and land shortages are forcing people onto disaster-prone areas like floodplains. The World Bank suggests that every dollar invested in effective disaster reduction saves seven dollars in costs of disasters. Protected mountain forests, coastal reefs, mangroves and other ecosystems buffer human communities against potentially disastrous events like avalanches, flooding and tidal surges.
Agricultural systems, water supplies and health services are also under pressure. Protected areas provide a suite of services, such as pure water (a third of the world’s hundred largest cities draw drinking water from forest protected areas), genetic material for crop breeding to meet changing environmental conditions, pharmaceuticals for emerging diseases and nursery grounds for marine and freshwater fisheries.
But protected areas are not a panacea. Many still leak carbon due to illegal logging, land clearance and poorly-managed fires. UNEP-WCMC studied several tropical protected areas and found forest loss much lower than elsewhere but still significant, perhaps as much as 3 per cent of the emissions from tropical deforestation.
Protected areas themselves face important new pressures due to climate change, with a risk that the solutions they offer will be lost if they decline in quality. Managers need to develop additional conservation strategies, such as building connectivity, providing routes for species to move as climate shifts, addressing extreme weather events and maintaining ecological integrity. A big challenge will be management in the face of increased uncertainly, for example to deal with changing rates of invasion by alien species or increased frequency of fires. Many management responses require new skills and new tools. In a crowded planet, any expansion of protection needs careful social safeguards and more stakeholders involved in decision-making than in the past. Protected area systems that recognise and involve local communities, indigenous peoples, the private sector and other conservation stewards in a mosaic of conservation actions are more likely to increase the resilience of ecosystems and people in a changing world.
Meeting the challenges will require careful coordination. In particular, the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity must work closely together to maximise opportunities from protected areas. Key meetings of the UNFCCC in 2009 and the CBD in 2010 provide forums for agreement. IUCN has a critical role in ensuring that the potential of protected areas is fully realised. PACT 2020 (Protected Areas and Climate Turnaround) is a major initiative co-ordinated by IUCN across its secretariat, regions and commissions. It aims to increase awareness and understanding of the role of protected areas in climate change mitigation and adaptation; to influence policy to ensure that protected area systems play an appropriate role in national and regional responses; and to provide tools and guidance to integrate protected area systems into national strategies for climate change. An authoritative publication is being prepared for a Protected Areas and Climate Change Summit hosted in Andalucia in November 2009, which will send a strong message to Copenhagen in December.
If you have information regarding the role of protected area systems in climate change mitigation or adaptation, please contact Nigel Dudley (nigel@equilibriumresearch.com). For further information on PACT 2020 please contact Trevor Sandwith (tsandwith@tnc.org) or Pedro Rosabal (pedro.rosabal@iucn.org).

Moricetown Chiefs do not represent Wet’suwet’en clans and houses.
Posted on March 11, 2019 by JLS	
No we are not referring to a baseball team, the Witset Chiefs the “Wet’suwet’en Five” do not represent Wet’suwet’en clans and houses. Let’s set the record straight, the “Wet’suwet’en Five” can say what they want to but it does not make them chief of the majority of Wet’suwet’en citizens. The Read More

Wet’suwet’en Land Claims Overlap
Posted on March 6, 2019 by JLS	
Corrected (March 8th 2019) The Office of the Wet’suwet’en have not been honest about a major impediment in settling land claims. They are refusing to concede or even negotiate land that other First Nations are claiming. There are by legal definition two Wet’suwet’en claims in progress, the “Office of the Read More

Warner Naziel is not Chief Smogelgem
Posted on March 5, 2019 by JLS	
Updated; Mar 11th 2013 New reader submitted photos. Our intention here is to prove and end the debate over who the present day Smogelgem is, and who it is not. This debate has gone on far to long and its time for the Laksamshu to come clean on the truth. Read More

Office of Wet’suwet’en – Blockades on the horizon?
Posted on March 1, 2019 by JLS

In defense of the Wet’suwet’en Matrilineal Coalition
Posted on February 27, 2019 by JLS	
UPDATED (evidence supporting the title of Smogelgem ) Wet’suwet’en women are being denied the right to exercise the roles they were sworn into for purely sexist reasons. If the male Wet’suwet’en are the only ones allowed to negotiate on behalf of their people, then their mistake was to allow Wet’suwet’en Read More

Wet’suwet’en Strong – The Symbol of Male Dominance over women.
Posted on February 22, 2019 by JLS	
The slogan “Wet’suwet’en Strong” with the fist raised is symbolic of male dominance and aggression against its own women, hereditary chiefs included. In this article we will show you what they have been hiding from the public. All too many times we have seen the “Wet’suwet’en Five” aka as the Read More

Wet’suwet’en Fact Check
Are you supporting aboriginal rights that deny other aboriginals of their rights?
The Unist’ot’en anarchists would have you believe it’s their land they defend, when the truth is the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council also claim the same land. Are you being duped into sending anarchists support and cash?
The anarchists and their Chiefs represent less that 15% of the Wet’suwet’en people.
Learn more, read and challenge your knowledge of the facts, or, challenge them to prove their claims, as opposed to taking their word for it.
See Map for Proof
We might not get our message out there as fast as mainstream media, but over time the world will see that there are two sides to every coin, and that the pen is mightier than the sword. We will make a difference to those who seek out the truth.
For very one person that reads what we have to say, they can influence many around them.
Flag Counter
We stared this flag counter
Jan 3rd 2016 – but this website has been on line since 2002.
The problem with the accuracy of flag counter is that many ad blocker programs prevent counts from external counters. We know we lose some of our count that way, but that’s ok, it’s all in fun.
….. and the good part is that we cannot manipulate the count, so what your seeing really did happen.

Leave this field empty if you’re human:
Before you comment, be aware that we will not tolerate any disrespect towards our local aboriginal brothers, sisters and neighbors. They should not bear the cross for what anarchist aboriginals are doing. They cause us all hurt and grief so be respectful in regards to our innocent neighbors.
On the issue of blockades in the Houston BC area, we will only allow comments from people living in the Bulkley Valley or by Wet’suwet’en members, if we can confirm they are such.
If your living on the pipeline path outside of our area, we will consider your comments, and post them if we feel they are appropriate.

New IRS rules, no increased funding in appropriations bill

IRS Practice and Procedure
Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, H.R. 244, on Thursday, and it will go to President Donald Trump for his signature. The bill funds the federal government through the rest of its fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. It passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday on a 309–118 vote and passed the Senate on Thursday on a 79–18 vote.
Included in the bill is $11.2 billion in funding for the IRS.
The bill appropriates $2.2 billion for IRS taxpayer services, of which $8.9 million is to be spent on the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program, $12 million is earmarked for low-income taxpayer clinic grants, and $15 million for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance grants. The Taxpayer Advocate Program receives $206 million, with $5 million of that earmarked for identity theft case work. Another $290 million is earmarked to improve customer service, identification and prevention of refund fraud and identity theft, and cybersecurity. To receive the additional money, the IRS commissioner must submit to the House and Senate appropriations committees spending plans for the use of those funds.
The bill appropriates $4.9 billion for IRS tax enforcement activities, $3.6 billion for operations support, and $290 million for business systems modernization. The bill also forbids the Treasury Department from using any of the $3 million appropriated for development and acquisition of “automatic data processing equipment, software, and services and for repairs and renovations to buildings” to pay for IRS operations support or IRS business systems modernization.
The bill also imposes rules on IRS conduct. It forbids the IRS from paying bonuses or from rehiring former employees without considering their conduct and tax compliance status.
The IRS is also forbidden from using moneys to pay for any videos, unless the Service-Wide Video Editorial Board determines ahead of time that the video is “appropriate.” Moneys cannot be spent on conferences unless the conference adheres to the “procedures, verification processes, documentation requirements, and policies issued by the Chief Financial Officer, Human Capital Office, and Agency-Wide Shared Services.” These rules are a response to reports from 2013 by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) that the agency had been wastefully spending money on conferences and on Star Trek-themed and dance videos (TIGTA, Review of the August 2010 Small Business/Self-Employed Division’s Conference in Anaheim, California, Rep’t No. 2013-10-037 (May 31, 2013)).
The bill also forbids the IRS from targeting an organization based on its “ideological beliefs”—perhaps in response to another 2013 scandal, in which the IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review applications for tax-exempt status from organizations based upon their names or policy positions instead of focusing on the activities of the organizations and whether they met the requirements under the law for tax-exempt status (TIGTA, Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review, Rep’t No. 2013-10-053 (May 14, 2013)). The bill also prohibits the White House from ordering the IRS to determine an organization’s tax-exempt status.

The suspect in Friday's officer-involved shooting in Cedar Bluff has been booked into the Knox County jail and denied bond.

According to arrest records, Maples was wanted for a pair of aggravated robberies allegedly committed at the Delta Express gas stations at 7001 Kingston Pike and 7301 Middlebrook Pike on Feb. 23 and 24, respectively.
When three deputies attempted to arrest Maples Friday at about 1:20 p.m., he drove his car toward them, almost hitting one of them, according to arrest records, prompting the deputies to shoot at him.

TNTT talks to children about traffic safety
Designed for children in kindergarten through 7th grades and their parents, this class focuses on pedestrian, bicycle and auto safety.
For grades kindergarten through 2nd, we accentuate the positive as much as possible. It is necessary to briefly cover what the brain does, so they can understand how important it is to keep their brain safe. We do this in a fun way by playing a short game of "Simon Says" and discussing what part of the body is essential for playing the game. As the younger grades are very impressionable, they do not need the material to be as hard-hitting as for the older students.
Almost as many children in this younger age group die as a result of being hit by cars as die as passengers in cars. It is very difficult to teach about this, since most of these kids think they know all there is about crossing a street. Because as many as 50 percent of auto/pedestrian incidents happen in crosswalks, we emphasize that defensive pedestrian techniques need to be practiced for street safety. The safest message is that small children should only cross busy streets if an adult is available to help them.
This is also true of driving a bicycle in the street. Bicycles are vehicles and we now use the term bicycle driver to emphasize that in the street, a bicyclist is required to follow all the rules every other vehicle driver follows. A child should not be allowed to drive a bicycle in the street until the he/she is at least nine years old, has taken a bicycle course and has proven on a number of bike rides with an adult that he/she understands and follow the rules of the road. Grades three through five require the message to be tougher than the younger grades. Boys, especially at this age, may be engaging in reckless behavior and may think the message is sissy stuff. We have found, however, that once the presentation is under way, they pay close attention to what is said and shown.
Grades six through nine usually involve major school transitions and are at risk for involvement with alcohol and other drugs, so we also talk about what these risks can cause in any recreational activity. We also place more emphasis on motor vehicle use and abuse. Even though they may not be driving, they may still be in situations where they are tempted to ride with someone who is driving in an unsafe manner.

We Dive Deep
Matters of personal finance vary widely by country making them confusing for newcomers. We want to help them navigate their new home, so we wrote the ultimate guide to American personal finance for new immigrants.
It’s All Greek
Personal finance is like languages, each country has its own and while it may share things in common with other systems, there are aspects that are individual to each country. Personal finance for new immigrants might be the most confusing aspect of their new country.
Yes, Americans and Britians speak the same language, but fanny in each language means two very different things (It’s dirty, so I’m not gonna write it, you’ll have to look it up).
At LMM we want everyone to have a solid understanding of personal finance. But we write under the assumption that everyone has at least some basics. And most of you do because you were born in America or have lived here long enough to understand the basics of our personal finance system.
But without meaning to, we have left out a big chunk of people who may need more help than anyone.
We are going to correct that with this article. At LMM, everyone is welcome. Welcome to listen to the podcast, read our site, and join our community.
If you’re new to America, welcome, this is for you.
Bank Accounts
First thing’s first. Opening a bank account will make a lot of the other things on this list easier to accomplish.
Banks are Safe
Not every country has a safe banking system but putting your money in a U.S. bank is 100% safe. A bank can fail, but if that were to happen, you wouldn’t lose the money you had in that bank.
The reason for this is the FDIC. The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It was created in 1933 in response to bank failures during the Great Depression. The FDIC is a government agency that protects the money consumers deposit into banks.
Nearly all U.S. banks are FDIC insured. You can check here to find out if a bank you’re considering doing business with is insured. Each checking and savings account is insured for up to $250,000. If you keep more than that in a bank account, you can open more than one account and divide the money between them.
Accounts
Most people have two types of banks accounts, a checking, and a savings account. A checking account is where people store the money they use to pay bills. A savings account is where people store money they are saving such as their emergency fund.
Some banks charge various fees, but there are plenty of banks that don’t charge for things like not keeping a certain amount of money in your account and a monthly fee just for having an account. When you’re shopping for a bank, choose one that offers free checking.
Banks typically pay interest on the money you have deposited with them.
For example, if you have $100 in a checking account that pays 1% interest, you will earn $1 per year. Most banks offer less than 1% though so the amount of money you make is negligible.
If you’re choosing between a bank that offers free checking and one that has a higher rate of interest, choose the one with free checking. You’ll save more in fees than you will earn in interest.
Online banks typically have fewer fees than brick and mortar banks, but it’s complicated and maybe impossible for non-residents to bank with them.
You don’t have to have both a checking and a savings account. Of the two, checking is more important. You can keep the money you’re saving in your checking account. The reason some people choose to have a savings account in addition to checking is to make it a little less accessible. If it’s harder to get to, it’s harder to spend.
Checking Accounts are Convenient
You don’t have to have a checking account, but it makes life more convenient. Many employers pay via direct deposit. This means rather than giving you a paper check to deposit or cash; the money is just automatically deposited into your checking account.
If you don’t have a checking account, you will have to take your paper check to a check cashing business, and they charge a fee to cash a check.
Most Americans pay their bills from their checking account. There are other ways to do it but like money orders but they’re a hassle and often cost a fee. You’ll have access to a debit card; we cover that in detail next. Unlike cash, when you pay a bill from a checking account, you have proof of the transaction should it be disputed for some reason.
Debit Cards
When you open a checking account, most banks will provide you with a debit card. A debit card acts like cash. If you have $5,000 in your account, you can access $5,000 on the debit card. Debit cards are typically branded with a Visa or MasterCard logo.
This doesn’t make them credit cards, but it does make them an acceptable form of payment in any establishment that accepts those credit cards.
It may take you longer to get a credit card than it takes to get a bank account, so the attached debit card is a convenient way to pay for things.
It’s not convenient to carry cash, and if it were lost or stolen, you have no way of replacing it. You can also use a debit card to get cash from an ATM, automatic teller machine and at certain retail outlets like grocery and drug stores.
You can find ATMs in lots of places, in banks, in stores, in bars, and in restaurants. When you receive your debit card from your bank, you will choose a PIN, a personal identification number. This is usually a four-digit number. You can insert the card into an ATM and withdraw cash, usually in denominations of $20.
If you use an ATM affiliated with your bank, there is no charge to take out cash, and when you get cash back during a transaction at a store, there is no fee.
If you use an ATM not affiliated with your bank, you will be charged a fee to do so, usually around $3. The machine will make you aware of the fee, and if you don’t wish to pay for it, you can cancel the transaction.
Checks
Your bank will give you a few checks which you can use to pay your bills. The check will have two sets of numbers at the bottom.
The first is the bank’s routing number. This is used to identify the bank. The next is your checking account number. This identifies your account.
Each check will also have a number in the top right corner. This is the check number to identify that particular check and the checks are numbered sequentially.
Checks are pretty out of date in the U.S. though. I don’t use checks for a single bill or expense I have. If you prefer checks, you can order more from your bank.
Establishing Credit
While a bank account doesn’t directly help you build credit, having one does establish a relationship with a bank, and you’ll need that if you want to borrow money in the future for something like a mortgage or car loan. We’re going to fully cover how to establish credit in the U.S.
Requirements to Open a Bank Account
It’s legal for non-citizens to open a bank account (for now anyway). That said, banks do have a responsibility to verify the identity of their customers so you will have to provide some documentation to open an account.
Name and Date of Birth: You can present a valid passport, your birth certificate, a U.S. or foreign driver’s license or identification card, or a consular identification card.
Identification Number: Documents with an acceptable ID number include a valid passport, driver’s license or ID card, a Social Security card, an alien identification card, or an ITIN, an individual taxpayer identification number.
ITINs can be issued to non-resident aliens not eligible for a Social Security number who file a U.S. tax return. This explains the process to apply for an ITIN. The process takes 6-8 weeks.
A Street Address: You can prove your address with your lease, a utility bill, or a driver’s license.

Establishing Credit
American personal finance relies heavily on credit and credit history is something that doesn’t follow you to a new country. As a new immigrant, you should start working on establishing credit as soon as you can.
What is a Credit Report?
A credit report is a summary of how you handle credit and debt accounts. It includes information about how much debt you have, if you pay your bills on time, and if you’ve ever had a bankruptcy.
It also covers any financial judgment against you, if you’ve had a home that was foreclosed on or an automobile that has been repossessed (the bank that loaned you money for these things took them back because you failed to make the payments.)
This information is sent to credit bureaus, there are three major ones in the U.S. and is what makes up your credit report. Your credit score is a number calculated using this information. Once you have established some credit, you can see both your credit report and your credit score for free at Credit Karma.
Why You Need a Credit Score
Not only do you need a credit score, you need a good credit score. Anytime you do something like renting an apartment, apply for credit or borrow money from a bank or an online lender, your credit report and score will be pulled.
This shows how likely you are to pay your rent on time and pay back borrowed money.
The higher your score, the better your credit. The better your credit, the lower the interest rate when you borrow money. The lower your interest rate, the cheaper the loan. If you borrow $100 and your interest rate is 5%, you have to pay back $105.
A Thin File
If you don’t have much or any credit history in the U.S. it doesn’t mean you have “bad” credit, but your credit file is “thin.” A thin file can make it hard to get credit so you need to build your file.
Credit Cards
This is a card that works like the debit card that we discussed earlier. The difference is, a debit card is tied to your checking account. You can only spend as much money as you have in your checking account on a debit card.
A credit card is not tied to your checking account. It comes with a pre-set limit partly determined by your credit score and a fixed rate of interest.
The interest isn’t determined by your credit score. The average interest rate on a credit card is about 15% but it can go much higher, and your set rate may go up if you miss or make late payments.
Ideally, you pay off the entire balance on your cards each month. If you don’t, you’re charged interest on the balance. This is how many, many people get into financial trouble.
Credit cards are not free money. If you can’t pay the balance every month and run up the balance, it can take years to pay off the card, and you will have paid hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest alone.
We wrote an entire article about how to use a credit card responsibly.
Secured Credit Cards
That warning issued, credit cards are a good way to build credit. Because your credit file is thin, you may not qualify for a traditional credit card. But you may be able to get a secured credit card.
It works like a debit card, you pay a deposit to the company that issued the card and that is your credit limit.
You still make a payment each month but if you don’t, the issuer has your money. The issuer will report your payments to one or more of the credit bureaus and boom, you have a credit history! Not all cards report so make sure you choose on that does. It takes about six months to establish a credit score.
Also, read the fine print, some secured cards come with a lot of fees. You can research cards at Credit Karma and choose the one that sounds best to you. Discover, and Capital One are both reputable companies that offer secured credit cards.
Authorized User
If you are close to someone who already has a credit card who is willing, they can make you an authorized user on their card. A card is issued in your name but under their account. They are responsible for any charges you make.
You can pay the balance each month or just don’t use the card. As long as the owner uses and pays the card, it will help you build a good credit score. The account holder doesn’t even have to give you a card if their nervous about this arrangement.
Not all cards report authorized user’s information to the credit bureaus though so be sure to choose one that does.
A Traditional Credit Card
Once you have established a credit file through your secured card which you paid off each month on time, you can apply for a traditional credit card. The best way to do this is to contact the company that issued your secured card and ask if they will transition you to a traditional card.
If that’s not possible, you can apply online for a traditional card. Credit Karma again is a good way to research cards. Each time you apply for a credit card, your credit score takes a small, temporary hit so you don’t want to apply for a card you”re unlikely to be approved for.
Credit Karma will show you a list of cards you’re more likely to get.
If you weren’t able to move from a secured card to a traditional one with the same company, don’t close the secured card. It will hurt your credit score. Leave it open, make one small charge on it a month and pay it off on the due date.
Your Rent
Some landlords and management companies will report your rent payments to a credit bureau. If yours does, sign up for the program. This is a great way to build your credit score with something you’re doing anyway, paying your rent!
Housing
Renting an apartment can be hard for U.S. citizens without a credit history or poor credit so recent immigrants will face even more significant hurdles.
How Much To Spend
Housing is the biggest expense for most Americans, and U.S. housing has become increasingly unaffordable. Ideally, your rent is no more than 30% of your take home (after tax) income. This can be tough but the closer you can stay to 30%, the easier your financial life will be.
Where To Look
There are all kinds of sites online to find apartments. Some of the biggest are Craig’s List, Nextdoor, Zillow, Walk Score, and local Facebook groups dedicated to housing.
You can also work with a real estate broker. You explain what you’re looking for in an apartment and your price range and it’s their job to find apartments that meet your criteria and show them to you.
In some cities, brokers charge for this service, and it can be a lot. In New York City, they charge up to 12% of the year’s rent, and they want the money up front. It’s a disgusting practice, and the brokers who charge that much are vultures whom I have nothing but contempt for.
If brokers in your new city charge huge fees, avoid using them at all costs. The service they provide in no way justifies their fees.
Lots of Documentation
This is what you’re going to need to rent an apartment on your own. You’ll need to verify your identity as you did when you opened your bank account. You’ll need a bank account, and that’s why we went over that first! Bring your bank statement showing your balance.
You will need proof of employment and something showing what your salary is. This can be pay stubs from your paycheck or a letter from your employer. If you rented in your home country, bring contact information from your previous landlords. That allows the potential landlord to contact them as a reference.
The landlord or management company will pull your credit report. If they charge for this, offer to bring the report yourself. You can get a free report at Credit Karma and so can the landlord, so there is no reason to pay a fee for this.
First and Last
Many apartments require first and last months rent at the time the lease is signed. Some may require an additional month as a security deposit. So long as there has been no damage to the apartment, you should get the deposit back at the end of the lease.
Most apartments rent for one year at a time, but you can sometimes find six-month leases.
Alternatives
If you’re not able to rent an apartment on your own, there are plenty of alternatives. You can sublet an apartment. A sublet means the original renter has moved out for whatever reason but still leases the apartment. It’s the renter who sublets it, not the landlord.
A sublet will require less documentation. The leaseholder will probably just be interested in how much you have in the bank. The same is likely true of a leaseholder looking for a roommate. Airbnb is another option but will be more temporary than the other two options and probably more expensive.
For all of these options, you likely won’t be required to sign a lease. If you’re unfamiliar with your new city, one of these options is probably better than renting your own apartment. A short-term situation allows you to familiarize yourself with the city and learn what neighborhood is best for you.
These housing situations also give you time to build up your credit history.
Insurance
Health insurance is a huge problem in the U.S. whether you’re a citizen or not. If you’re coming from a country that had national health care, you’re going to be in for a terrible surprise. Socialized healthcare is coming to the U.S. too but for now, we have to pay, pay, pay.
Health Insurance
If you’re lucky in the U.S., your employer provides medical insurance. You may have to contribute, but the amount is less than if you were on your own.
If you don’t have insurance through your employer, you can buy it on the Health Insurance Marketplace, commonly called Obama Care. This is available to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and “lawfully present” immigrants.
If you meet certain income requirements, you are eligible for subsidies. That means part of your monthly cost for your insurance policy will be covered by the government. You may also be eligible for Medicaid which is a free or low-cost medical insurance plan.
If you are not documented, you can still purchase medical insurance, but you will not be eligible for any subsidy.
No hospital can legally turn you away. If you are sick or injured and go to the emergency room, you will be treated. You will receive an enormous bill, but you are entitled to medical care.
Unless your situation is life-threatening, going to an urgent care clinic is often a better solution than going to an emergency room. The wait time will be less as will the cost. Urgent care clinics are not open 24 hours a day, but they do have extended, holiday, and weekend hours.
Auto Insurance
Auto insurance is relatively easy to get if you have a U.S. driver’s license. Currently, about a dozen states issue driver’s licenses to immigrants no matter their legal status. Auto insurance can be bought online.
Investing
Investing is the best way to build wealth. It’s easy for U.S. citizens with a Social Security number, they can open an account with a robo-advisor like Betterment and get started in five minutes. But without that number, it can be tougher.
Never depend on a single income. Make investments to create a second source.
Tweet This
Until you have a Social Security number, you will have a hard time investing in the set it and forget it way we recommend at LMM. This is why so many new immigrants start their own business because it provides them with a job and an investment.
In the meantime, we can give you the basics of investing.
Taxes
Immigrants to the U.S., all of them here legally or not, pay taxes. Billions of dollars worth of taxes. Those authorized to work pay taxes just like any citizen and those not authorized often pay using their Individual Tax Identification Number.
The best estimates come from research by the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, DC, think tank, which suggests that about half of undocumented workers in the United States file income tax returns. The most recent IRS data, from 2015, shows that the agency received 4.4 million income tax returns from workers who don’t have Social Security numbers, which includes a large number of undocumented immigrants. That year, they paid $23.6 billion in income taxes.
Tax returns must be filed around April 15th each year. Employers provide W-2 statements to employees, this form shows the amount of money you’ve earned for the previous year as well as federal, state, and other taxes withheld from your paycheck.
Many Americans do their own taxes using software that walks you through the process. But it can be intimidating for first-timers. There is a program, The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), that helps those who make under $54,000, have a disability, or have limited English, prepare and file their tax returns for free. You can find a location near you here.
If you’re unsure of your tax status, the IRS has a page that explains it.
We Dive Deep
Personal finance for immigrants and for everyone else is why LMM exists. We want everyone to have the information they need to make good financial decisions. Because this is an article and not a book or a volume of encyclopedias, we’ve only skimmed each subject.
But LMM has dived deep on every subject; each link contains more in-depth information on the subject each section discusses. We have a toolbox that contains all of the stuff we use to manage our money.
We also have a robust, smart, and friendly Facebook community. Everyone is welcome, and you can ask your personal finance questions there or just get some support if you’re struggling with your finances.
America is a country built by immigrants. Whether your relatives came over on the Mayflower hundreds of years ago or you arrived yesterday, welcome to America.

Libertarian Party of Nevada (LPN) Condemns Cuban Government for Arresting Libertarian Activists
by Zachary Foster
114LC
on February 10, 2017
See official copy here.
For immediate release...
Las Vegas, Nevada (10 February 2017) – The Libertarian Party of Nevada condemns the Cuban government’s arrest of two libertarian activists and calls for their immediate release. Ubaldo Herrera Hernandez and Manuel Velasquez Visea were arrested 2 February 2017 by plainclothes secret policemen. Both activists are still detained on trumped up charges.
Mises Cuba, the independent Cuban think tank based on Auburn, Alabama’s Ludwig von Mises Institute, confirmed their ongoing detention. Both men were specifically targeted for their peaceful activism promoting limited government and free markets. They are political prisoners whose actions have harmed no one and damaged no property.
“The arrest of the libertarian activists in Cuba is a jarring reminder of both the Obama administration’s willingness to sacrifice Cuban refugees on the altar of realpolitik, and the Trump administration’s open hostility toward civil liberties and the rule of law,” says LPN Vice Chairman David Colborne. “I call on all liberty-minded political leaders in the U.S. to chart a new course by demanding the immediate and safe release of these Cuban libertarian activists.”
LPN Chairman Jason Smith expresses his condolences to the families of Herrera and Velasquez, and wants political leaders to “heed the judicial messages sent to our own President this week as a warning of what can happen to a country controlled by fear and too much government. What happened to these two activists could easily happen here in America, especially given the authoritarian streaks of Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions.”
The Libertarian Party of Nevada calls on the 49 other Libertarian state parties, our National Chairman Nicholas Sarwark, all Libertarian parties in Latin America, and all concerned citizens to:
1) Condemn the Cuban government and the Communist Party of Cuba, and demand the safe release of the libertarian prisoners,
2) Ask the US State Department to place diplomatic pressure on Cuba for their release,
3) Call Senators, Congressmen, Governors, and State Legislators to make their own statements of support for these political prisoners.
Tyranny must be stopped wherever it threatens lives and freedom, whether in the US or in Cuba. The Libertarian Party of Nevada stands in solidarity with all Cuban libertarians.

The Spartans as Lacedaemonians
The region of the Peloponnese which held the Spartan people was called Lacedaemon (now Laconia) and the Spartans were known as the Lacedaemonians from at least the fifth century B.C. By that time, Lacedaemon was used interchangeably with Sparta when referring to the political entity. What happened before that time?
In the Iliad, the land ruled by Menelaus is referred to as “a hollow” which is “scarred with ravines”, certainly an apt description of the Spartan lands as they look today. But if the setting of the Iliad was the Mycenaean Age, the residence of Menelaus would have been a castle. Where was it? Toynbee speculates that the original “Sparta” may have been at Therapne or Amyklai, nearby towns that date back to the Mycenaean time.
Sparta originally meant “sown land” and represented part of the cultivated area of the Eurotos Valley. Later, at some point, the land became the town when the Spartans relocated there. They may have called themselves Lacedaemonians from the time their territory encompassed more than one or two villages, but Spartans only when they needed to distinguish themselves from the Perioeci and the Messenians.
The city of Sparta consisted of four settlements: Pitane, Limnai, Kynosoura, and Messoa. The tombs of the Agiadai kings were located in Pitane, while the tombs of the Eurypontidai were located in Limnai. This suggests that the two royal houses originated from these towns and their combination occurred voluntarily. How Kynosaura and Messoa may have joined the Spartan community is obscure.
It appears that the foundation of Sparta must have occurred no earlier than the beginning of the ninth century B.C. because there is no evidence of Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean culture there. The earliest that Spartan kings can be dated is through independent evidence is ~ 730 B.C. when Polydoros and Theopompos reigned. This was also the time of the First Messenian War, when Messenian names ceased to be listed among the winners at the Olympic Games.
Although we don’t know the origin of the Lacedaemonians, the Spartans and Messenians of the fifth century were speaking the same dialect of Northwest Greek as the Dorian invaders who attacked the entire Peloponnese and destroyed Mycenae. The fertile plain of Sparta and whatever wealth existed there as a result of the Mycenaean culture would have been attractive to the invaders sweeping down from the north. After the invasion, the newcomers combined with the natives to form what would become the Lacedaemonian people.

‘’because there is no evidence of Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean culture there’’ – There is no evidence in the Eurotas valley but there is in the Menelaion site.
‘’ and the Spartans were known as the Lacedaemonians from at least the fifth century B.C’’ – There is few of the inscribed monumets in Olympia,dedicated by Spartans(Akmatidas and Gorgos for example),one winning the pentathlon and one probably being one of the judges..both dated from 6th BC. So Lakedaimonioi is the term archeology knows much before 5th BC, Spartans is the term only used rarely,and in the context of Spartan citizens (while Lakedaimonioi is used in the very same context by Spartans themselves).

From rectal feeding to threats aimed at children, the horrific practices outlined by the Senate Intelligence Committee’s torture report have provoked widespread condemnation of the CIA. As if these torture methods weren’t enough to swallow in one news cycle, a number of talking heads were quick to applaud the torturers. Andrea Tantaros of—surpriser!—Fox News and her unbelievable “America is awesome” rant is just one example.
Last night, Jon Stewart showed he’s just as disgusted with these responses as the rest of us. Watch below:
TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
The Mueller report might not say it, but David Corn will. So amid the swirling headlines and cable chatter, David provides a clear and honest assessment of what we really know about Trump's actions: “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia's Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”
Even though Mueller may be done with his investigation, Mother Jones is not. David and his team in Washington have been digging deep on the Russian connections and other corruption scandals since before the 2016 election, and we're not stopping now. If you agree there's more to dig into and expose, please help our team do it with a tax-deductible donation today.

Vandals target Ditchfield Gardens benches	
March 30, 2016 /1 Comment/in Community facilities, Town centre /by My Westhoughton
Vandals have ripped benches out of the ground in Westhoughton’s Ditchfield Gardens.
The town centre haven has been blighted by vandals in recent weeks.
Westhoughton town councillor David Wilkinson has secured the repair of the benches and has reported the anti-social behaviour to the police.
Bolton Council confirmed today that they would fix the benches.
Councillor Wilkinson said: “It is a shame that some people treat our town centre gardens in this way.
“Hopefully we can get these benches repaired as quickly as possible.
“I hope that the police can take some action to put a stop to the anti-social behaviour.”

Wall Street Sees Lower Open as Oil Slides, Traders Eye Progress on Trump Tax Cuts
March 22, 2017, 09:11:47 AM EDT By MT Newswires, MT Newswires

U.S. stocks were pointing to a lower open on Wednesday following similar declines in the oil market as investors grew increasingly worried about president Donald Trump's capability to follow through on his promised fiscal policies.
Oil prices were lower with global benchmark Brent crude down 1.51% recently, and U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate down 1.49% as the commodity continued to face heavy pressure after industry data showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose higher than expected.
Date released at 9:00 a.m. showed the FHFA house price index turned in flat in January compared to the sizable 0.5% gain seen by forecasters, according to data compiled by Econoday.
At 10:00 a.m., forecasters see existing home sales for February falling 2.4% to 5.555 million annualized pace.
In equities, UniPixel ( UNXL ) shares were 21.1% higher pre-bell after the company said that it has secured a long-term supply contract for its XTouch touch screen sensors for a major U.S.-based PC maker.

In this Monday, Jan. 7, 2019, file photo, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton waves to well-wishers following an appearance at Barnard College with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in New York. Clinton says she won’t run for president in 2020, but vows she’s “not going anywhere.”
Hillary Clinton says she won't run for president in 2020, but vows she's "not going anywhere."
The former secretary of state, senator and first lady ruled out another campaign during an interview posted Monday by New York TV station News12.
Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump, says, "I'm going to keep on working and speaking and standing up for what I believe."
She says, "What's at stake in our country, the kind of things that are happening right now are deeply troubling to me."
Trump on Mueller Probe: ‘We Can Never Let This Happen to Another President’
President Donald Trump addressed the media about the summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump presidential campaign during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu Monday.
(Published Monday, March 25, 2019)
She says she has spoken with several of the candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and has told them, "Don't take anything for granted, even though we have a long list of real problems and broken promises" from the Trump administration.

China Fund Managers Slash ZTE Valuation After US Sanction

Chinese funds have slashed valuations of ZTE Corp. after the United States banned American companies from selling components to the telecoms equipment maker for seven years, a move ZTE said threatened its very survival.
The U.S. action last week was sparked by ZTE's violation of an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran. American companies are estimated to provide 25-30 percent of the components used in ZTE's equipment.
Chinese mutual fund managers cut the value of the stock in their portfolios by 20-30 percent in a spate of announcements over the weekend, a blow to ZTE that suspended trading in its mainland and Hong Kong shares on April 17.
Around 40 Chinese mutual funds have adjusted the valuation of ZTE in their portfolios since it suspended trading. In the latest batch, five fund managers revalued the stock on Saturday.
Huatai-PineBridege and GTJA Allianz cut their valuation of ZTE's mainland shares to 25.05 yuan, 20 percent lower than its last trading price. JT Asset Management - the most pessimistic - slashed the valuation to around 30 percent below ZTE's last close of 31.31 yuan ($4.98).
Several funds with exposure to ZTE's Hong Kong shares, including HuaAn Fund and Harvest Fund, cut valuations to about 20 percent below the last trading price of HK$25.60 ($3.26).
ZTE, which had a market capitalisation of about $20 billion before trading in its shares was suspended, did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.
The valuation adjustment by mutual funds could be just preliminary, as the real impact of the U.S. sanctions needs to be assessed continuously as the incident unfolds, said Reagan Li, investment manager at private fund house Shanghai V-Invest.
On Sunday, ZTE said it was "making active communications with relevant parties and seeking a solution to the U.S. export denial order." Earlier, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would allow ZTE to submit more evidence related to the matter.
The threat to ZTE's business has triggered a broad sell-off in technology shares as investors fear the sector could suffer from the fallout, or that other firms could be targeted by the United States amid escalating trade tensions.
Shares in display maker BOE Technology slumped as much as 6 percent on Monday, even after the firm said it had not received any official information regarding U.S. sanctions in response to rumors in the market that it would be targeted.
The CSI Information Technology index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed tech firms fell 2 percent.
"Investors are asking: who will be next on the U.S. sanction list?" fund manager Li said.

The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened in September as exports hit a five-month low, suggesting slowing global demand could undercut economic growth in the final three months of the year.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap increased 7.6 percent to $43.03 billion. Economists had forecast the shortfall at $40.00 billion in September.
"The disappointing performance in export activity suggests that the loss of export competitiveness from the strong dollar and the weak global backdrop are becoming a net drag on U.S. economic activity," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The trade deficit was bigger than the $38.1 billion gap that the government had assumed in its advance gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter published last week.
This suggests the 3.5 percent annual growth pace it estimated will probably be trimmed by as much as 0.3 percentage point when the government publishes its revisions later this month. Trade was reported to have contributed 1.32 percentage points to GDP growth.
The trade report adds to September construction spending data published on Monday that also pointed to a downward revision to the third-quarter growth estimate.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the trade data.
Exports in September fell 1.5 percent to $195.59 billion, the lowest since April, a sign that weakening demand in key markets such as China and the eurozone was starting to weigh.
Exports are likely to weaken further after a survey of U.S. manufacturers published on Monday showed a decline in a gauge of export order growth.
STRENGTHENING DOLLAR
Apart from slowing global demand, export growth is seen crimped by a strong dollar, which so far this year has strengthened by about 4 percent against the currencies of the country's main trading partners.
The decline in exports in September was broad-based, with the exception of food and beverages, which rose.
Exports to the European Union fell 6.5 percent in September, while those to China slipped 3.2 percent. Exports to Japan tumbled 14.7 percent. There were also declines in exports to Mexico and Brazil.
Overall imports were unchanged in September as petroleum imports hit their lowest level since November 2009. A domestic energy boom has seen the United States reduce its dependence on foreign oil, helping to temper the trade deficit.
Declining crude oil prices, which hit a seven-month low in September, are also helping to put downward pressure on the value of petroleum imports.
Consumer goods imports, however, were the highest on record, as were non-petroleum imports. Imports from China also hit an all-time high, leaving the politically sensitive trade gap at $35.6 billion, the highest on record.
Imports from Canada were the highest since July 2008.

CBO: Debt Remains High Under President’s Budget
Jul 13, 2017
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently released its analysis of the president’s fiscal year 2018 budget. Using its own economic and technical assumptions, CBO finds that the budget would not reach balance in 2027 as the administration projects — but instead the deficit would grow from $693 billion in 2017 to $720 billion in 2027. CBO estimates that nearly all of the difference between the administration and CBO arises because the administration projects “higher revenue collections — stemming mainly from a projection of faster economic growth.” While the president’s policies would reduce 10-year deficits from their current-law levels, the budget does not address the most significant drivers of our long-term debt — growing spending on Social Security and Medicare, combined with inadequate revenues.
Key findings from CBO’s report:
Over the next 10 years, CBO predicts that the economy will grow by slightly less than 2.0% each year, on average. By contrast, the administration assumes that GDP will grow by slightly less than 3.0% each year, on average.
The president’s proposals would reduce budget deficits by $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years, with spending cuts of $4.2 trillion that are partially offset by revenue reductions of $0.9 trillion.
More than 85% of the president’s proposed spending cuts come from repealing the Affordable Care Act, making additional reductions to Medicaid, and cutting spending on non-defense discretionary programs.
Although federal debt would be relatively constant over the next 10 years at approximately 80% of GDP, it would remain at a very high level historically — double its level over the past 50 years.
In coming years, our budget will be under enormous strain as the large baby boom generation retires, people continue to live longer, healthcare costs continue to outpace GDP growth, and our tax system is unable to keep up. The deficits that result from these pressures threaten our economy and our future. The president and Congress should work together to find durable, bipartisan solutions to our long-term fiscal challenges.
Economic assumptions. CBO estimates slower economic growth than the Administration projects. Over the next 10 years, the Administration assumes that GDP will grow, on average, by slightly less than 3.0% each year. By contrast, CBO predicts that the economy will grow, on average, by slightly less than 2.0% each year1.
CBO’s economic projections are much more in line with private-sector forecasts. They are also more consistent with existing demographic trends, including the retirement of the baby boom generation, which will slow the growth of the labor force — and the economy — over the next ten years. Although the economy grew at a faster pace between 1960 and 1990 than what CBO now projects, economic growth during those earlier years was boosted by baby boomers and women entering the workforce. Baby boomers are now beginning to retire and the growth of women’s participation in the labor market has leveled off.
The budget will not reach balance by 2027. In May, the administration predicted that the president’s policies would produce a balanced budget by 2027. However, the administration’s optimistic economic assumptions are a significant driver of its projections about the budget deficit. Under more realistic economic assumptions, CBO estimates that deficits would grow from $693 billion in 2017 to $720 billion in 2027.
Debt will remain at historically high levels under the president’s budget. CBO estimates that federal debt would remain at approximately 80% of GDP in 2027. Historically, that is a very high level — double the average over the past 50 years. Since 1790, there have only been six years in which the debt was higher than it is today, and those were during and just after World War II. After the war, debt began to fall sharply as a share of GDP as the economy grew and some debt was paid down.
The president’s policies reduce revenues and spending. Over the next 10 years, the president’s budget would reduce spending by $4.2 trillion, while lowering revenues by $0.9 trillion. The revenue reductions stem from the proposed elimination of taxes that were imposed by the Affordable Care Act. The president also calls for a major overhaul of the tax system, but because the administration did not provide enough details about the reform, CBO was unable to score its costs or assess its effects.
The spending cuts are concentrated. More than 85% of the reductions come from repealing the Affordable Care Act, making additional reductions in Medicaid, and cutting spending on non-defense discretionary programs. These reductions will affect a wide range of programs for low- and middle-income families.
The president’s policies would push non-defense discretionary spending to historically low levels. Non-defense discretionary spending funds a wide range of governmental activities including education, infrastructure, R&D, homeland security, food safety, disaster assistance, environmental protection, public housing, federal law enforcement and the courts, and a host of other programs. Under the president’s budget, spending on those programs will decline from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2017 to 1.6 percent in 2027. At that level, non-defense discretionary spending would be more than 50 percent below its 20-year historical average.
Long-term fiscal challenges remain. Addressing our long-term fiscal challenges is critical for ensuring that America has adequate resources for investing in our future, protecting critically important programs, and creating robust economic growth and opportunity for future generations. The president’s budget does not resolve these fundamental structural challenges. The president and Congress should work together and across party lines to find common ground in order to achieve durable policy solutions for the long-term fiscal health of the nation.
1 This growth figure includes CBO’s estimate of the economic effects of the president’s budget.

Rail Transit Politics Continue In Houston
Harris County District Attorney rules that the anti-rail group Texans for True Mobility violated no state campaign laws.

"Texans for True Mobility violated no state campaign laws when it concealed the identity of contributors who underwrote advertisements bashing Metro's transit expansion plan before the Nov. 4 referendum, Harris County District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal said Friday." The DA claims that the group was educating the public rather than calling for a "no" vote on the referendum. The DA received contributions from group members for his election campaign in 2000 and his re-election campaign this year. A civil court lawsuit and a complaint to the Texas Ethics Commission are still pending against the group.

The West Wing has a preferred distillation of the president’s foreign-policy doctrine.
'Don't do stupid sh--' (stuff)
By MIKE ALLEN
06/01/2014 02:43 PM EDT
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Forget The New Yorker’s “leading from behind,” and even President Barack Obama’s own “singles … doubles.” The West Wing has a preferred, authorized distillation of the president’s foreign-policy doctrine: “Don’t do stupid shi*t.”
The phrase has appeared in The New York Times three times in the past four days. So, if the White House’s aim was to get the phrase in circulation, mission accomplished!
Story Continued Below
The phrase – as “Don’t do stupid stuff,” with a demure disclaimer that the actual wording was saltier and spicier than “stuff” — appeared in the Los Angeles Times at the end of Obama’s Asia trip this spring, was reprised in the lead story of Thursday’s New York Times.
( Also on POLITICO Magazine: Moneyballing Obama's foreign policy)
But the West Wing hit the jackpot Sunday when it was used twice in The New York Times — once in the news columns, and once in a column by Thomas L. Friedman, who had been part of an off-the-record roundtable with Obama on Tuesday.
The Columbian newspaper of Vancouver, Washington, actually had the scoop, when it reported in February that it kept selling out of mugs that are emblazoned: “Don’t Do Stupid Stuff.” http://goo.gl/9oQ8d3
Here is a timeline of the phrase’s propagation in the press:
— Christi Parsons, Kathleen Hennessey and Paul Richter in the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune of April 29: “The president’s aides have scrambled to put things in simpler terms. ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is the polite-company version of a phrase they use to describe the president’s foreign policy.” http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-obama-military-20140429-story.html
( Also on POLITICO: Clinton's chapter on Benghazi)
— Christi Parsons and Kathleen Hennessey in the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune on May 25: “Privately, White House officials have described the working label for Obama’s doctrine as ‘Don’t do stupid stuff.’ Within the tight circle of foreign policy aides in the White House, the shorthand captured Obama’s resistance to a rigid catch-all doctrine, as well as his aversion to what he once called the ‘dumb war’ in Iraq.” http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-obama-foreign-policy-20140525-story.html
— Mark Landler, in the lead story of Thursday’s New York Times: “In private conversations, the president has used a saltier variation of the phrase, ‘don’t do stupid stuff’ — brushing aside as reckless those who say the United States should consider enforcing a no-fly zone in Syria or supplying arms to Ukrainian troops.” http://goo.gl/WG20of
— Steve Chapman of the Chicago Tribune editorial board, in Thursday’s paper: “Instead of trying to do great things, he’s settled for a policy that his aides summarize as ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ — though they use a different word than ‘stuff.’” http://goo.gl/bPPaS6
— Mark Landler on page 4 of Sunday’s New York Times, “White House Memo: In Obama’s Speeches, a Shifting Tone on Terror”: “In his second term, a time that presidents typically set about cementing their legacies as statesmen, Mr. Obama has instead settled on a minimalist foreign policy — one that he laid out at West Point and sums up with a saltier version of the phrase, ‘don’t do stupid stuff.’ ‘There is a fundamental and profound distinction between this speech and the earlier speeches,’ said David J. Rothkopf, the publisher of Foreign Policy magazine. ‘The Nobel Prize speech was infused with hope, ambition, and the desire to better the world. This speech is built around the idea of not doing stupid stuff.’” http://goo.gl/ZUbKcM
— Thomas L. Friedman writing from Sulaimaniya, Iraq, in the Sunday Review section of The New York Times, “Obama’s Foreign Policy Book: Here are a few working titles for the president’s consideration”: “When President Obama sits down to write his foreign policy memoir he may be tempted to use as his book title the four words he reportedly uses privately to summarize the Obama doctrine: ‘Don’t Do Stupid Stuff’ (with ‘stuff’ sometimes defined more spicily).” http://goo.gl/GCHKjT

Donald Trump: 28 Days Later
So far, Trump has signed at least 23 executive actions, signed five bills into law, seen 12 members of his Cabinet confirmed and sent 168 (undeleted) tweets.

Donald Trump will hit the four-week-mark Friday on a presidency that has begun like no other — full of big promises, constant controversy, the ever-present encroaching of major scandal, and zero regard for the previous norms of American politics.
Beneath the noise, however, there has been a march, however halting and disorganized, toward Trump’s promised radical remaking of American policy, foreign and domestic. The border wall his critics said he’d never build has been ordered, his promised rollback of regulations is in full swing, his Supreme Court pick that will likely sit on the bench for decades, and even the “Muslim ban” he promised during the Republican primary was put in place, however briefly, in altered form.
Story Continued Below
The dual track is familiar to those who watched his campaign, during which a series of controversies and scandals garnered mass attention while few foresaw Trump’s success in building a winning coalition. But a presidency is a longer race than even the campaign, and it remains to be seen whether Trump can outrun his missteps the way he did last fall.
So far, Trump has signed at least 23 executive actions, signed five bills into law, seen 12 members of his Cabinet confirmed, nominated one justice to the Supreme Court, sent 168 (undeleted) tweets, fired one acting attorney general and demanded one resignation: that of his own national security adviser.
It has been 28 days. Here they are.

Key moments from the Presidential Inauguration
01/20/17 02:02 PM EST
Inauguration Day: Jan. 20
Where things went according to plan:
The speech: In a short address, Trump stuck to the themes that won him the election, painting a scene of current “American carnage” — claims of economic decay and rising crime that are contradicted by a considerable volume of statistical evidence — as well as his own promise to usher in a new American glory.
First executive actions: Trump signed an executive order that allowed for the delay or waiver of certain Affordable Care Act provisions, and another that froze pending regulations until they won approval from the White House or a newly appointed agency head — early moves toward core promises of his campaign.
Cabinet confirmations kick off: Two of Trump’s best-received Cabinet picks, retired Marine Gens. James Mattis for Defense Secretary and John Kelly for Homeland Security, both won easy confirmation in the Senate. Vice President Mike Pence swore them in that evening.
Where things went off the rails:
The crowd size: The crowds for the inauguration and ensuing parade were bested by the audience that attended former President Barack Obama’s first inauguration, a disparity unveiled both by Metro rail ridership numbers and, more immediately, by aerial photographs.

Day 2: Jan. 21
According to plan:
First foreign leader visit is announced: Press secretary Sean Spicer announced the first visit from a foreign leader, with the Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom scheduled to visit Trump at the White House during his first week in office.
Off the rails:
The Women’s March: Hundreds of thousands of protesters descended on Washington and cities around the nation (as well as internationally) in massive numbers to demonstrate against the new president, opening questions about whether his election would galvanize progressives into a more politically effective resistance.
The CIA speech: Trump visited the CIA headquarters to show his support for their work, but while standing before the Agency’s wall honoring the 117 CIA officers who died in service, he delivered a campaign-style address that stepped on his message.
Sean Spicer: The new press secretary called a news conference, but instead of taking questions, he offered a searing critique of the news media’s accuracy while delivering no fewer than five demonstrably (at times even obviously) false statements in five minutes. The appearance won Spicer widespread mockery as his inaccuracy became the subject of a short-lived but widely shared meme.
Day 3: Jan. 22
According to plan:
Conversation with Netanyahu: Trump spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, extending the invitation for him to visit the United States in February and taking an early step toward a promise of warmer U.S.-Israeli relations.
Trump’s second response to the Women’s March: After initially complaining about the protests (see below), Trump took a more measured tone in a follow-up tweet: “Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.”
Off the Rails:
“Alternative facts”: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer’s Saturday night falsehoods by telling NBC’s Chuck Todd that Spicer was simple presenting “alternative facts.” The phrase was widely mocked and cast further doubt on White House credibility just days into the administration.
The beginning of the end of Flynn: Sunday night, The Wall Street Journal published an article with an eyebrow-raising lede: “U.S. counterintelligence agents have investigated communications that President Donald Trump’s national security adviser had with Russian officials, according to people familiar with the matter.” The problem would not go away quietly.
Day 4: Jan. 23
According to plan:
More executive actions: Trump signed three more executive actions aimed at fulfilling campaign promises on what the White House billed as the first work day of the administration. The orders officially withdrew the U.S. from negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, froze federal hiring (except for the military and in certain security situations) and barred federal funds from going to international groups that provide abortions. The move on trade was the final nail in the coffin for U.S. participation in TPP, which had been slowly careening toward doom during the presidential campaign in which Trump and Clinton both voiced opposition to it. The hiring and abortion orders represented two more boxes checked on the conservative wish list.
Spicer, take 2: Spicer’s much-anticipated Monday briefing was mostly drama-free, and the press secretary pledged the administration’s “intention is never to lie to you.”
Tillerson on the move: Rex Tillerson won a party line vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to advance his nomination for secretary of state. His prospects were uncertain after a rocky confirmation hearing and doubts voiced by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who ended up supporting the former ExxonMobil CEO nonetheless.
Off the Rails:
Trump’s meeting with lawmakers: In a meeting with bipartisan congressional leadership at the White House, Trump repeated his false claim that widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote in the general election.
Conway on tax returns: Conway walked back a claim she made Sunday — in which she seemed to indicate Trump never had any intention of releasing his tax returns — and returned to the line repeated throughout the campaign, that his returns would be released after the completion of an audit.
Day 5: Jan. 24
According to plan:
More executive orders: Trump signed five more executive actions: Two encouraged the construction of pipelines, one sought to expedite the approval of infrastructure projects, one called for material used to build pipelines to be made in America “to the maximum extent possible,” and another called for swifter permitting for domestic manufacturers.
Nikki Haley: Trump’s pick for ambassador to the United Nations, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, was confirmed by the Senate 96-4.
Off the Rails:
Spicer on voter fraud: Spicer defended Trump’s voter fraud claims by incorrectly citing a widely debunked study. He did not say whether he agreed with Trump’s claim, though he claimed that Trump had based his belief on “studies and evidence.”
I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017
Day 6: Jan. 25
According to plan:
Immigration orders, Part 1: Trump signed two orders on immigration. One included a call for the beginning of planning and construction of the border wall and the hiring of 5,000 more border patrol agents, another pushed for the hiring of 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and aimed to cut off federal funding to “sanctuary cities.”
Paul Ryan’s Philly speech: In a speech at congressional Republicans’ retreat in Philadelphia, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the Republican-led Congress would replace Obamacare, cut taxes and fund Trump’s border wall by August. It’s usually the White House making grand predictions and Congress coming in with the cold water, but Ryan’s statements represented a show of unity.
Off the Rails:
Voter fraud tweet: While his administration worked to steer the conversation toward Trump’s policy, the president himself — possibly still upset over focus on his loss in the popular vote — couldn’t resist relitigating the election. “I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and.... even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!”
Day 7: Jan. 26
According to plan:
Bannon bashes the press: From the campaign trail into the White House, Trump and his team have grown fond of attacking the news media — a move that seems always to rile up their base. Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon added his voice to the chorus, telling The New York Times that the media is “the opposition party” and that the press should “keep its mouth shut and just listen for awhile.” Trump would later repeat the “opposition party” phrase to describe the press.
Off the Rails:
Spicer, again: On a flight back from Philadelphia, where Trump addressed the Republican congressional retreat, Spicer suggested a 20 percent tax on imports from countries “like Mexico” could be used to pay for the border wall. But Spicer quickly walked back the proposal, saying it was not a policy proposal but rather “one idea” for how the wall could be paid for. The idea was out there long enough to get panned by some Republicans, including Sens. Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham.
Mexico responds: Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned visit to the U.S. in response to Trump’s Jan. 25 executive actions.

Day 8: Jan. 27
According to plan:
March for Life: The March for Life came to Washington with anti-abortion activists feeling a sense of renewed vigor now that Trump has been elected. Pence, in particular, won plaudits by being the first sitting vice president to address the annual event — a hometown crowd for him if there ever was one.
First presidential presser: Donald Trump welcomed British Prime Minister Theresa May, an event that went smoothly and showcased a tight partnership between the two nations. Trump answered his first questions from reporters as president.
Off the Rails:
Refugee executive order stumbles out of the gate: Trump signed a far-reaching executive order that temporarily halted the admission of new refugees into the United States, imposed an indefinite ban on the entry of refugees from Syria, and suspended the entry of citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. The executive order, signed late on a Friday afternoon, prompted immediate confusion about its enforcement, including chaos at points of U.S. entry. And, within hours, it met resistance in court, including legal challenges that would eventually succeed in putting the order on ice.
Holocaust Remembrance Day statement: The White House released a statement to honor International Holocaust Remembrance Day, but made no explicit mention Jewish people. Later in the weekend, two Republican groups joined in criticism of the statement. The White House later called criticism of its statement “pathetic.”
Senate pushback: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell felt compelled to warn Donald Trump not to lift sanctions on Russia, ahead of a scheduled Saturday morning call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Day 9, Jan. 28
According to plan:
Executive orders: Trump signed three executive actions — a reorganization of the National Security Council; a five-year ban on lobbying for administration appointees and a lifetime ban on lobbying the government for other countries; and an order tasking the Department of Defense with coming up with a plan to defeat the Islamic State within 30 days. The NSC order proved the most significant, as it moved Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, onto the principals committee of the National Security Council.
Putin on the line: Trump’s first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was “positive,” the White House said, and involved discussions of how the nations could cooperate to combat terrorism. The White House made no announcement regarding election interference-related sanctions after the call, assuaging the fears of some who worried Trump would roll back the sanctions.
Off the Rails:
Travel ban fallout rulings: A series of rulings from federal courts Saturday night significantly curtailed Trump’s order. A judge in Brooklyn suspended deportations, a Boston judge issued a temporary restraining order on the action and a Virginia judge blocked the deportation of green-card holders.
Travel ban fallout optics: As some travelers from the seven affected countries found themselves detained at American airports — even if they had valid visas — and government officials scrambled to make sense of the order, civil liberties lawyers, protesters and Democratic politicians descended on airports. The backlash marked a spontaneous rebuke to Trump’s order and raised questions about how much planning went into the sweeping action.
Australia calling: Trump’s phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull went off the rails after Trump bragged about his election win, expressed anger over a deal to take refugees from Australia and told Turnbull it was his “worst call by far” of the day. Details of the contentious conversation emerged in a Washington Post report a few days later.
Day 10, Jan. 29
According to plan:
Order rewrite: The Department of Homeland Security attempted to modify the travel order by saying it no longer applied to green-card holders from the seven targeted countries. That portion of the ban had been especially troubling to the courts.
Clarification: Trump posted a statement on Facebook defending his travel ban, saying the order was “not a Muslim ban,” and stressing the temporary nature of it.
Off the Rails:
Yemen raid: A special operations raid ordered by Trump in Yemen resulted in the death of a U.S. service member, Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens, the wounding of three others and significant civilian casualties. The White House argued that the raid, which targeted fighters from a branch of Al Qaeda, was successful because 14 militants were killed and intelligence was gathered.
Continued protests: Protesters continued to rally against the travel ban with protests in cities and at airports around the country, and at a large, impromptu march from the White House to the Capitol.
ACLU money haul: The American Civil Liberties Union, a nonprofit spearheading legal challenges to Trump’s immigration ban, raised more than $24 million in online donations over the weekend — about six times what they typically receive annually in online donations.
Day 11, Jan. 30
According to plan:
One in, two out: Rolling ahead with executive orders to fulfill campaign promises, Trump signed an order decreeing that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be repealed. Conservative groups cheered the move.
You’re fired: Trump took authoritative action Monday night in defense of his travel ban, firing acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend it. Trump also swiftly replaced Yates, an Obama administration appointee, with Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Virginia, ensuring essential functions of the Justice Department remained intact.
Off the Rails:
‘Betrayal’ attack: The White House statement on Yates’ firing was inflected with personal attacks and sounded less like a presidential statement than a piece of campaign rhetoric. “"The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration."
Spicer vs. State: As State Department employees registered dissent with the travel ban, Spicer announced from the White House that career employees who disagree with the new administration “can go.”
Behind the scenes: A Monday night report revealed Hill staffers had aided the drafting of the controversial immigration order — but without informing party leadership, explaining some of the initial confusion and crossed wires after the order dropped.

Day 12, Jan. 31
According to plan:
LGBT order: Making good on another campaign theme, Trump pledged to keep in place an Obama order barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Trump ran as the most outspoken supporter of LGBT rights to win the Republican nomination.
Gorsuch for SCOTUS: In a crowning moment for Trump and the conservative movement — not to mention Sen. Mitch McConnell, who made it possible — the president announced Neil Gorsuch as his pick for the Supreme Court in a prime-time unveiling from the White House. For many Republicans who disliked Trump but voted for him anyway with the Supreme Court in mind, this was a moment of vindication. The announcement went off without a hitch, and Gorsuch was quickly the recipient of praise, at least some of it bipartisan.
Off the Rails:
A ban, or not a ban?: Spicer told the press that the travel ban — which both he and the president had referred to previously as a “ban” — was not, in fact, a ban. His attempted explanation would later be mocked on “Saturday Night Live.”
Wisconsin trip nixed: Trump’s planned trip to the Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee was canceled in part over concerns about protests, CNN reported. Trump ended up hosting Harley-Davidson executives at the White House later, instead.
Day 13, Feb. 1
According to plan:
Tillerson gets in: Rex Tillerson, among the more controversial of Trump’s Cabinet picks due to allegations of excessive coziness with the Putin regime, was confirmed as secretary of state by the Senate in a 56-43 vote.
Saber rattling: Trump ran on taking a tougher stance against Iran, and his White House made good on the pledge. National security adviser Michael Flynn announced the White House was officially putting Iran “on notice” for recent provocative behavior, and senior officials later would not rule out military action in response.
Getting to know you: Paul Ryan and Trump’s son-in-law/senior adviser Jared Kushner dined together at the Capitol Hill Club.
Off the Rails:
DeVos by a thread: Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, announced they would oppose Trump’s pick to lead the Education Department, Betsy DeVos. With Democrats unanimously opposed to the Michigan billionaire, that left DeVos headed for a 50-50 vote if the status quo held. The White House voiced confidence that she would be confirmed, which she later was with Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.

Trump's top moments at the National Prayer Breakfast
President Trump delivers remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.
02/02/17 01:15 PM EST
Day 14, Feb. 2
According to plan:
On message: Trump told the National Prayer Breakfast that he would “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment, which restricts political activity by religious groups. The message was one he and Pence trumpeted often on the campaign trail, and it went over well with the Prayer Breakfast crowd.
Off the Rails:
Bowling Green outrage: Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway cites a fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” in an interview on on MSNBC’s “Hardball” as she presses the case for Trump’s immigration ban, an attack she said “most people” weren’t aware of “because it didn’t get covered.” The next day, after the Internet had a lot to say about it, Conway apologized saying she got her facts scrambled.
Talking Arnold: In a move that struck some as tone deaf, Trump used a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast to mock the ratings of The Celebrity Apprentice ratings with its new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Uber out: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit Trump’s business council after some questioned whether his presence with the group represented an endorsement of Trump’s policies.
Day 15, Feb. 3
According to plan:
Dodd-Frank pull back: Trump signed an executive order that backed sweeping changes to U.S. financial regulations, in what was viewed as a first step toward undoing Obama’s signature financial regulatory reforms. Trump also moved to revamp a controversial conflict-of-interest rule for financial advisers.
Court victory: Trump’s travel ban won a legal battle — albeit a fleeting one. A 21-page decision from U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel Gorton offered preliminary backup for the ban, concluding that Trump’s executive order was legally sound.
Off the Rails:
Judge halts ban: Late Friday, U.S. District Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, granted a temporary restraining order that halted Trump’s travel ban and restrictions on a nationwide basis, setting up a protracted legal fight. Robart rejected arguments from Justice Department attorneys who said the ban was within the president’s national-security powers.
Viola drops out: Vincent Viola, Trump’s pick to serve as Army secretary abruptly quit, saying he was concerned he couldn’t disentangle extensive financial ties. Viola, who had been nominated in mid-December, said he concluded he couldn’t clear all of his conflicts. He is the founder of trading firm Virtu Financial and owner of the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers.

Playback: Melissa McCarthy spoofs Sean Spicer on ‘SNL'
The best of the weekend's late-night TV: Melissa McCarthy satirized White House press secretary Sean Spicer on ‘Saturday Night Live.’
02/06/17 10:49 AM EST
Day 16, Feb. 4
According to plan:
Ukraine promise: In a call with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Trump promised that the U.S. would work to restore peace on the border between the Ukraine and Russia, according to a readout released by the White House. "We will work with Ukraine, Russia, and all other parties involved to help them restore peace along the border," Trump said during the 5 p.m. call, which was described by the White House as "a very good call."
Off the Rails:
Judge assault: Reacting to a court ruling late on Friday night, Trump assailed a federal judge who issued a broad block on his executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. In a series of tweets, Trump called the ruling from Robart “ridiculous” and lashed out at him. “The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” Trump tweeted.
‘Saturday Night Live’ hits: A pair of skits that focused on the Trump White House quickly went viral with their scathing portrayals of Trump’s relationship with world leaders (and top aide Steve Bannon) and White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Spicer, played by Melissa McCarthy, is lampooned as a combative, inarticulate press basher. In another skit, Trump, portrayed by Alec Baldwin, calls world leaders as Steve Bannon, dressed as the Grim Reaper, coaches him — before relegating Trump to a child’s desk.
Day 17, Feb. 5
Off the Rails:
Putin problem: Trump shook up an otherwise quiet day when, in an interview with Fox News' Bill O’Reilly, he seemed to equate Russian President Vladimir Putin with American leadership. O’Reilly said to Trump: “Putin’s a killer.” And Trump responded, “A lot of killers. We got a lot of killers. What, you think our country’s so innocent?” Critics, including GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, pounced on Trump’s apparent moral equivalence.
More judge attacks: Trump took to Twitter on Sunday afternoon to rip a federal judge and warn that he would be at fault if the U.S. was attacked. "Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"
Day 18, Feb. 6
According to plan:
Hearing set: The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals gave the Trump administration hope — ultimately short-lived — that the travel ban could resume. The court agreed to hear arguments for and against a stay on Trump’s executive action that temporarily halted entry by refugees, including those from Syria, and banned travel from seven Muslim-majority nations.
Off the Rails:
Media cover-up speech: Speaking to U.S. troops at Central Command in Tampa, Florida, Trump delivered an overtly political address that accused the news media of covering up terrorist attacks. Later, Spicer told reporters on a flight back to Washington that Trump was merely suggesting some attacks don’t receive the coverage they deserve, and that things like protests receive too much coverage.
Terror pushback: The White House released a list of 78 terrorist attacks later that night that it said had been underreported by the U.S. media. The list was riddled with misspellings and typos, and included dozens of attacks that received significant, in some cases, blanket U.S. media coverage. Among the “under covered” attacks cited: A shooting at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub that left dozens dead; an attack in San Bernardino, California, and large-scale attacks in Paris and Brussels.
Bowling Green continued: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway came under fire after news emerged she cited the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” in at least two previous interviews. In interviews with Cosmopolitan and “TMZ” Conway made reference to fictitious events in Bowling Green.
Melania lawsuit: A lawyer for first lady Melania Trump argued in a lawsuit filed Monday that an article falsely alleging she once worked for an escort service hurt her chance to establish “multimillion dollar business relationships” during the years in which she would be “one of the most photographed women in the world.”
Day 19, Feb. 7
According to plan:
DeVos confirmed: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos won Senate confirmation by the narrowest possible margin, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the deciding vote. Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine voted against DeVos, who faced criticism for past comments and lack of background in public education, and had a rocky confirmation hearing. Pence’s vote was the first time a vice president was called upon to help confirm a member of the Cabinet.
Off the Rails:
Teleconference in court: The Trump administration was able to argue the merits of the travel ban on a teleconference with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. A Justice Department lawyer argued that presidents have broad authority when it comes to decisions involving national security.
Murder claims: Trump held two listening sessions at the White House to kick off the day, one with county sheriffs and one with veterans’ advocates. But the message was stepped on by Trump’s false claim that the U.S. murder rate is at its highest level in more than four decades and by his offer to help “destroy” the career of a Texas state lawmaker who opposes asset forfeiture.
Kelly regrets: Testifying on Capitol Hill, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he should have delayed the implementation of the travel ban.
Yemen fallout: Yemen withdrew permission for American special operations forces to conduct ground operations in the country, The New York Times reported. The move came in the aftermath of a U.S. raid — the first commando raid ordered by Trump — that resulted in the death of one U.S. service member and significant civilian casualties.
Faux pas avec la France: Word leaked of a rocky phone call between Trump and French President Francois Hollande, with Trump veering into rants about the U.S. getting shaken down by other countries.
My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017
Day 20, Feb. 8
According to plan:
Sessions in: Trump’s pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, won confirmation by a 52-47 vote.
Off the Rails:
Nevertheless, she persisted: In another galvanizing event for Democratic critics of Trump and Republicans, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was reprimanded and told to sit down and be quiet during debate on Sessions after reading a letter critical of sessions written by Coretta Scott King. Mitch McConnell said that Warren was warned but “nevertheless, she persisted,” a phrase that spawned thousands of Facebook posts and tweets, T-shirts and more.
Supreme discontent: In a meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch lambasted the president's pointed criticisms of a federal judge who put a stay on his travel ban. Gorsuch said Trump's remarks were "disheartening" and "demoralizing." The comments marked an extraordinary break between a top White House nominee and the president.
Nordstrom attack: President Trump used Twitter to blast luxury retail store Nordstrom for dropping the clothing line of his daughter Ivanka Trump from its stores. Ethics experts and others immediately criticized Trump for using his Twitter account (and the bully pulpit) to attack an individual business. Nordstrom had previously announced it was dropping Ivanka Trump’s clothing line due to poor sales numbers.
Day 21, Feb. 9
Off the Rails:
Flynn in free fall: The Washington Post published a report citing nine sources stating Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions in a phone call with the Russian ambassador, contrary to Flynn’s and the administration’s statements about the call.
Ban on ban upheld: A federal appeals court unanimously rejected the Trump administration’s request to reinstate a travel ban that blocked refugees from entering the U.S. as well as citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. Trump responded to the ruling by tweeting, in all caps, “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!”
Nordstrom problems: House adviser Kellyanne Conway came under fire for encouraging people to buy Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, a likely violation of ethics rules that bar such advocacy from White House officials.

Day 22, Feb. 10
According to plan:
Diplomatic display: Trump held a joint news conference and met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Keeping options open: After legal setbacks for his travel and refugee ban, Trump alluded to future action on the issue: Twice during the day, Trump suggested that the White House would try to redraft the order in order to strengthen it against legal challenges.
Off the Rails:
Flynn fallout: Vice President Mike Pence became entangled in reports that national security adviser Mike Flynn discussed sanctions with Russia before President Trump was sworn in. Pence had denied on national television that sanctions had been discussed. The Pence camp insists Pence was speaking based on what Flynn told him — raising the possibility that Flynn had lied to the vice president.
Abrams tanked: President Trump blocked Elliott Abrams' appointment to a top post at the State Department because of his criticisms of Trump during the campaign. Newly sworn-in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had favored Abrams, a veteran Republican foreign policy hand, for the role because of his breadth of knowledge.
Conspiracy theorist: Reports emerged that Trump once again espoused conspiracy theories about illegal voters — with no evidence. In a closed-door meeting with congressional leaders, Trump asserted that he, and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, would have won in New Hampshire without illegal votes.
Day 23, Feb. 11
According to plan:
Getting in a round: Trump continued a diplomatic visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by hitting the links with him in Palm Beach, Florida.
Diplomatic partnership: Trump and Abe showcased a tight, on-message partnership in the face of an apparent missile test by North Korea. The two worked closely together to craft a denunciation of the launch. Appearing with Trump at a hastily called news conference at in Florida, Abe called the attack “intolerable.”
Off the Rails:
North Korea problem: North Korea’s decision to test the missile is another implicit challenge to Trump — and seemed designed to rattle Trump and Abe’s otherwise feel-good meeting.
Public diplomacy: Trump and Abe came under fire for apparently reacting to the launch in public view at Mar-a-Lago. Members took pictures of the two world leaders, huddled over documents lit by cellphone flashlights, in plain view of diners at the Trump-owned property. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called for a review of the security protocols at Mar-a-Lago after images popped up on Facebook and elsewhere.
Day 24, Feb. 12
According to plan:
Quiet-ish day: After a day of golf and a night of diplomatic crisis the night before, Trump avoided much spectacle. He met with his Treasury nominee, Steve Mnuchin, and casino magnate Steve Wynn at Mar-a-Lago before flying back to Washington.
Miller impresses the boss: White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller did a round of Sunday shows — which Trump cheered on, via Twitter.
Off the Rails:
But Miller fails with others: Miller was ripped as shaky and dissembling on Twitter and faced sharp questions from his Sunday-morning show inquisitors, including this back-and-forth with NBC’s Chuck Todd about national security adviser Michael Flynn: TODD: "Let me ask you this, if you were caught misleading the vice president of the United States, would that be considered a fireable offense in the Trump White House?" MILLER: "It's not for me to answer hypothetical. It wouldn't be responsible. It's a sensitive matter.” But Trump was satisfied with the performance.
Tweeting the morning away: Trump started his Sunday with a rapid-fire string of tweets targeting critics and got into a back and forth with fellow billionaire Mark Cuban. "I know Mark Cuban well,” Trump tweeted. “He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!" Notably, Cuban campaigned for former Secretary of State Hillary Clintonand aided her campaign.

Day 25, Feb. 13
According to plan:
Welcome, neighbor: Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a productive meeting, reaffirming the warm relations between the U.S. and Canada. Trudeau talked about the two nations’ common ground and avoided talk of Trump’s controversial travel ban. Trump said that U.S. trade issues with Canada are less egregious than those with Mexico.
Growing Cabinet: Trump's pick for Veterans Affairs secretary, David Shulkin, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. His pick to lead the Treasury Department, Steven Mnuchin, was confirmed in a 53-47 vote.
Off the Rails:
Out like Flynn: As night fell in Washington, so did the ax on Flynn, who resigned over reports he misled Pence about his discussions of sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
Lingering questions: Flynn’s ouster didn’t end the story. There were an array of questions: Who knew what, and when? Why did Trump wait weeks after he learned about his calls with the Russian ambassador to relieve him of his post? And will Flynn eventually be asked to testify to Congress about his tenure?
Pudzer problems: Problems continued to emerge for Trump’s embattled Labor nominee, Andy Puzder. Talk show host Oprah Winfrey gave the Senate committee considering his nomination a 1990 tape of a show in which Puzder’s wife, in disguise, discussing allegations of domestic violence.
Day 26, Feb. 14
According to plan:
Regulatory blow: In a tangible strike at regulations, Trump signed a bill that killed SEC regulations requiring companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments.
Off the Rails:
Bombshells: The New York Times reported that members of Trump’s campaign staff had regular contacts with Russian security officials. About an hour later, CNN largely matches the development. The stories come hours after Spicer denied that Trump’s campaign had any contact with Russians.
Conway conflict: The Office of Government Ethics said it wanted White House lawyers to investigate Conway after she called on people to buy Ivanka Trump’s clothing line during a television appearance.
President Donald Trump (L) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hold a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 15. | Getty
Day 27, Feb. 15
According to plan:
Netanyahu’s visit: Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had an amiable meeting and a joint news conference. Trump also seemed to affirm his commitment to the Jewish State’s conservative governing coalition by abandoning the U.S. commitment to the two-state solution.
Shifting the conversation: Trump took to Twitter in response to allegations his associates had been in contact with the Russians during the campaign, writing: “The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” Conservative media outlets added their voice to the argument, slamming leakers within the government.
Off the Rails:
Puzder pulls out: Andy Puzder, Trump’s pick for Labor secretary, withdrew from consideration after POLITICO published a tape of his ex-wife discussing abuse allegations on “Oprah” and a number of Senate Republicans urged his withdrawal.

Key moments from Trump's news conference
President Donald Trump held a press conference on Thursday.
02/16/17 03:40 PM EST
Day 28, Feb. 16
According to plan:
The accomplishment-touting part of the presser: At his first solo news conference as president, Trump ticked through his accomplishments so far, touting his first four weeks in the White House as the most productive of any presidency.
The media-bashing part of the presser: Trump’s base loves when he attacks the media, and he served up the red meat at his news conference, deploying his favorite insults for the press: “fake news” and “dishonest people.”
Signing a bill into law: Trump signed into law a bill nullifying a Department of Interior rule, much loathed by Republicans, aimed at protecting streams.
Off the Rails:
The rest of the presser: Trump warned about the dangers of “nuclear holocaust.” He asked a black reporter if she was “friends” with the Congressional Black Caucus, and if she could set up a meeting with its members. He bragged, falsely, about the historic margin of his election win, only to be corrected on the spot — then blamed his staff for giving him bad information. And he said never instructed Flynn to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador but said that he would have.
At one point in the presser, Trump said he didn’t think “there's ever been a president who in a short period of time has done what we've done."

Splits remain over EU policy on emissions tax
Simon CossWHILE the trend in the EU is towards being ‘seen to be green’, persuading people to contribute more of their hard-earned ecu towards supporting eco-friendly policies is another matter altogether.
European Voice
5/27/98, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 3:23 AM CET
The fact that tax hikes and electoral popularity rarely go hand in hand has meant attempts by the European Commission to persuade EU governments to increase levies on energy products have so far been less than successful.
The institution first floated the idea of introducing taxes on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 1992, to coincide with the Rio Earth Summit. But the plan was unceremoniously dumped two years later by EU leaders at their meeting in Essen.
The Commission has since opted for a less ambitious approach. In March last year, Taxation Commissioner Mario Monti came forward with a new plan to extend harmonised minimum excise duties to coal, natural gas and electricity while still allowing governments to introduce rebates for environmentally friendly energy production.
However, even this relatively modest plan appears to have come up against a brick wall in the Council of Ministers. Member states are currently so divided over the proposals that they have not even been discussed at ministerial level.
National officials are theoretically involved in negotiating the precise figures and products which should be covered by a possible directive. But cynics claim these 'negotiations' are little more than delaying tactics.
Last December, the energy tax issue gained an added sense of urgency when the EU agreed at the Kyoto climate change talks to cut its emissions of six greenhouse gases to 8% below 1990 levels by the year 2012.
Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard argues it will not be possible for Union governments to meet that commitment without energy taxes.

How can I obtain the Ecodial software package.
Unfortunately the Ecodial software package is not available in the UK.
The reason we do not support the software in the UK is that it does not calculate cable sizes in accordance with BS7671 (IEE Wiring Regulations)

Woman fought with bus driver, causing bus to fall in China river; 15 feared dead

BEIJING — A fight between a bus driver and a passenger who missed her stop caused the bus to plunge off a high bridge into China’s Yangtze River, police said Friday. All 15 people onboard are presumed dead.
An eight-second surveillance video released by Chongqing city police on its Weibo social media account shows the two arguing and grappling with each other in the moments before the bus suddenly veered across oncoming traffic and off the bridge Sunday morning.
Buses in China often have surveillance cameras.
A statement from Wanzhou district police said the 48-year-old female passenger asked the driver to pull over after she missed her stop, but he didn’t. She walked up to the driver’s seat and scolded him. The driver turned his head back several times arguing.

As the quarrel escalated, the statement said, the woman hit the driver on the head with her cellphone. The driver took his right arm off the steering wheel and fought back. He grabbed her arm when she attacked him again, then hastily steered to the left, sending the bus out of control.
The Chongqing police also posted dashcam video from a nearby car showing the bus colliding with an oncoming vehicle before smashing through a guardrail and falling into the Yangtze, a major river in southwestern China.
The Wanzhou police statement said the behavior of the driver and the passenger seriously endangered public safety and violated the law.
Rescuers lifted the wreck of the bus from the river Wednesday night. Thirteen bodies have been found and two remain missing, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

AG Warns of Pain Relief Cream Scams
Home / News / AG Warns of Pain Relief Cream Scams
February 13, 2018
It may seem like it’s your lucky day. Someone calls (or you receive a robocall) to tell you there’s an available prescription pain relief cream that will relieve you of any joint or back pain. Better yet, it won’t cost you anything (or at least no more than your standard co-pay/deductible) because your insurance provider will pay for it.
Don’t fall for it. The caller may be trying to overcharge your insurer or steal your personal information. Read this story from a state attorney general. If you have questions about health care schemes, contact your local Senior Medicare Patrol.

Tennessee Eastman Company/eastman Kodak - Kingsport, Tennessee
Did you or someone you know work at Tennessee Eastman Company/eastman Kodak in Kingsport, Tennessee? If so, you should be aware that asbestos was present at that facility for some time, putting employees and anyone else who frequently visited the location in Kingsport at an increased risk for health concerns.
Asbestos Exposure
While asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral, it was once used in thousands of consumer, industrial and construction products. Despite its uses, asbestos is a known human carcinogen and the National Cancer Institute suggests that there is no safe level of asbestos exposure.

Stereophile: the Next Generation
Stereophile Staff | Mar 1, 2019
Today, Stereophile announces its first major Editorial changes in decades, with an expansion of the Editorial team and a change in leadership.
Since 1986, through many generations of corporate ownership, John Atkinson (right, above) has been the Editor and bedrock of the magazine. After nearly 331/3 years, JA has decided to relinquish daily responsibility for producing the magazine and as of April 1 will take on a new (and newly established) position: Technical Editor. Stepping into his shoes as Editor will be long-time Stereophile contributor Jim Austin (left, above). Deputy Editor Art Dudley will continue to do what he does best (and what he prefers to do): writing columns and reviews and editing the prose of Stereophile's other contributors, while managing an expanded suite of responsibilities. Richard Lehnert, who began his association with Stereophile in 1984 as our long-time Copy Editor and was the magazine's Music Editor 19871996, has also chosen this time to retire from the magazine that bears the stamp of his influence; Lehnert will be replaced by a new copyeditor, Linda Felaco. These changes will be effective as of the July issue of Stereophile.
"I'm deeply honored to become only the third Editor in Stereophile's distinguished history," says Austin, who has been writing for Stereophile for some 15 years. "It's a major responsibility to follow in the footsteps of audio legends like J. Gordon Holt and John Atkinson, and to hold the reins of the world's most important high-end audio magazine. It's an opportunity I relish, though. It's hard to even imagine a job I'd enjoy more."
As a teenager, Jim spent many hours at the Sound Shack, the audio boutique in his home town of Ft. Pierce, Florida. That's where he bought his first serious pair of loudspeakers, Polk Audio Model 7Bs, which he paired with a succession of Japanese receivers and Technics turntables. Later, he earned a PhD in physics and worked for a while as a research scientist, applying methods from nuclear physics to study of semiconductors and other materials. "It was nothing to do with music," Austin says, "but I was an experimental physicist and I learned a lot about electronics and craft." Still later he became an Editor at Science magazine, where he worked for 14 years, rising to the rank of Senior Editor while contributing to Stereophile on the side.
Despite the change in leadership, major editorial changes are not envisioned at the magazine. "Stereophile is a successful magazine," Jim says, "which is remarkable when you consider all the titles that folded or today exist only online. I intend to look for opportunities to make Stereophile better: more engaging, more relevant, more entertaining, with the best, most insightful writing about music and audio.
"My main objective, though, is to steer a steady courseto keep Stereophile pointed in the direction it has been pointed in for decades. In particular, Stereophile has always been a subjectivist audio journal. Its main concern has always been with how music sounds through the equipment we review and how it affects us, the listeners. But for 30 years Stereophile has been built upon the edifice of John Atkinson's measurements, which examine whether the components we review are thoughtfully and solidly engineered. Under my watch, we'll continue to do both those things, with, I hope, renewed vigor."
John Atkinson adds: At last fall's Rocky Mountain Audio Fest I asked a young Stereophile reader how he had discovered us. "I started reading my Dad's copy," he explained. "He used to read you in Hi-Fi News magazine in the 1980s."
I blanched. But yes, approaching 71 years old, I am long in the tooth. The June issue of Stereophile will be my 390th and though my hearing is still good, I decided it was time to hand the reins over to a new and, more importantly, a younger man.
As Jim noted, I will still be on Stereophile's masthead as Technical Editor. But having worked with Jim for the past 15 years, I know as Editor he will succeed in taking J. Gordon Holt's and my magazine to even greater heights. You have the conn, Jim.

Submitted by cgh on March 1, 2019 - 4:38pm
I find this interesting. First, let me congratulate both men - JA, I was 9 years old when you took over and you arguably shaped many of my current beliefs about sound and many of my considerable spending decisions through the years; and JA2, whose conclusions I haven't always shared, but whose articles I have always read from beginning to end with interest. I've viewed JA's "quant" a welcome counter to the pages of "qual", which has always been Stereophile's yin to TAS's yang. In this regard JA2's appointment is a continuation of something that I have always regarded as a quality that made Stereophile the absolute best... "TAB". I have hired many people that I feel counter the norm, or my own personal beliefs, on the hope they'd create a diversity of thought that hedge the downside risk of groupthink and hivemind; in that regard I think this change ensures Stereophile's relevance for years to come, albeit with some turnover in staff given what I suspect is a strong personality. I say this in a positive sense. I don't know JA2, but my inference from his articles and comments is that he will kick the tires at every turn! Congratulations to both of you!

As the bad-boy of planetary-geology who's had his fair-share of AAAS rejections (and one success!), I too had no idea that JA (Austin, that is) was a rocket scientist!
In communications with Jim, I've found him to be enthusiastic, searching, experienced, and knowledgeable -- perfect material for the job. Had I not disposed of my vinyl collection and STD/Hadcock/Nytech set-up back in 1983 to go to university, I would have trod an audio career path. Schmuck that I am, now I'm re-buying it all again. Heigh-ho...
The best to both JAs

Scientific Rigor ?
Submitted by johnnythunder on March 2, 2019 - 6:50pm
You're joking. The magazine has it already. It's called the measurements section of the review. Keep Stereophile exactly as it is. This is not Scientific American. It is art and magic and it cannot be explained with measurements or algorithms. If you can't accept that by now after 50 years of Stereophile and TAS, you're in the wrong hobby.

"Double Blind Tests" PROVE that all vodkas taste the same and that a Stradivarius is indistinguishable from a student violin. Actually those stupid results prove double blind tests though useful for many things are often not. And then as I found out when challenged to a double blind amplifier test that didn't go the way the test designer wished (to prove all amps that measure the same are sonically indistinguishable), excuses are made and "outlier" results (like when I got all identifications correct) get tossed.

Submitted by Anton on March 4, 2019 - 12:13pm
I love DBT (usually SBT and I get to play with the volume) but I know what you mean.
I have an acquaintance who did the "Brita" challenge at a science meeting neurology conference with a good vodka compared to cheap vodka that had been filtered through a Brita. There were six different Brita samples, corresponding to "one filtration," "two filtrations," etc.
He nailed the good vodka, the cheap vodka, and identified each filter sample by how many times it had been filtered.
Amazing.
Getting the test criteria straight would help with other DBT.
At some point, someone skilled enough should be able to rise above the terrible deafness caused by DBT and be able to tell things apart, like you did with the amps!
Also, what's true for an amp driving a complex thing like a speaker may not apply to other things, like fuses, "wires," etc. Still lots to flesh out!
I was just perusing the Hi Fi News site and they actually published measurements of wires, fascinating!
As a reader, I would love to see JCA (technical editor) compare and contrast an array of findings with these more subtle devices.
Both sides of the "makes a difference / no it doesn't" crowd need to find some room for common discussion.
Transparent measurements, listening trials, all part of the fun.
Our local club does blind comparisons and nobody gets butt hurt about challenging our listening skills.
In a recent club challenge, a plain over the counter fuse won the day vs. fuses costing up to 120 bucks per fuse! So, it seemed we had the ability to hear what was up, but the challenge was won by the little guy.
We did the same thing with passive preamps at a THE Show and a 400 dollar unit KILLED the 15,000 dollar and 2,000 dollar competition. (This was on a fancy system with King's Audio electrostats, etc.)
It's like when the 6 dollar bottle of wine beats the 120 dollar bottle, good for us!
I digress...instead of feeling threatened by DBT (actually, SBT and not instantaneous would be fine,) we should start the party and see how golden our ears really are.
Man, in the realm of measurements, how about comparing the differences between "broken in" and not for equipment, and see what may change!
Everyone is so afraid of being wrong, or having their perceptions "judged" that we poo poo a very fun thing!
In wine competitions, tasting is done blind and we get feedback on our perceptions, for better or worse. Hi Fi should be able to emulate that and see what happens.

In your opinion, which DBT's are ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:43am
... "useful" and which are "stupid"?
Are the "useful" ones those with whose outcomes you agree and the "stupid" ones those with whose outcomes you disagree?
A given test doesn't prove that all vodkas taste the same.
It does demonstrate that a particular group of tasters could not reliably distinguish among the particular group of samples they tasted. If you're open-minded, you might consider conducting your own blind taste test to see if you reach the same conclusion, or not.
Likewise, outlier results shouldn't be tossed out of hand.
Rather, the test should be repeated to determine if those results can be confirmed.

Question: If the only way to "test" equipment is by using your own equipment in your home, how do you shop?
I listen in stores and at shows, as well. Otherwise, it would be almost impossible to survey the marketplace!

I've been reading Stereophile since right before the digest to large format switch over and I have always loved it. Of course, back in those days, getting your CD player and a simple DAC figured out was a priority for me, anyway. By my calculations, that's right after your (JA) takeover, so I'm pretty accustomed to your editorial style. While I do miss the old cast of characters (J10, Corey, Sam and the late Mr. Reina), I'm sure with JA2 in the drivers seat, the course will stay true. Thanks for the great ride, so far.

I had a Vinyl Audio Shop which failed when 33.3 died. My Sales continued because the Monster Cable Accessories Full Line sold quite well. I've subsequently discovered that P&A ( parts & accessories ) are the most profitable part of Businesses like mine. So, especially today, a Line ( Range if you're Brit. ) of eBay garments and accessories could be viable and exciting.
You might be in an ideal position to be Stereophile's Official OEM for all such items. You Could do Swiss Army Knives with Silver Inlayed Logos, Embroidered Hats, Silk Screened shirts and all manner of other desirable Desk Top trinket items. Your Local Speciality Sales Co. can and will provide endless useful suggestions. It could be a great business for you, you'd even be able to supply a wide range of Audio Manufacturers with High Quality Products and fulfillment.

We're about to have 5th Gen. Phones, PS Audio is converting PCM to DSD.
Fossil Based everything is being replaced with the "Green New Deal".
A few Old Timers clinging to 33.3 Collecting doesn't move anyone's Needle.

ps. of course, I still own a substantial Vinyl collection including the rather rare Wilson vinyls ( I was a Wilson Dealer ) which I'll eBay in 2020 as I settle down in Venice Florida where 8-Tracks are understood and cherished parts of the Mustang Classic Car Group.

Last time I checked, I was not dead! Believe it or not I'm a (horror of horrors) vinyl listener and I can count many acquaintances/friends as the same, and most are NOT old-timers! Of course we all listen to digital as well, but why can't the 2 co-exist? Apparently not in your (place appropriate superlative here) world.

I was referring to my Vinyl Business in the 1980s not You and your acquaintances.
The Audio Business continued, Redbook replaced 33.3, the Automotive Market bloomed into the Dominant Component of the 2 Channel Audio Industry with Billions of Dollars in Sales ( hidden in the New Car Window Sticker). The Movie Industry migrated from Magnetic Tape to 5.1 & 7.1 etc.
I attempt to be fair in saying it isn't 33.3 Vinyl's fault that it's number of proponents has tapered off to a very few committed & dedicated collectors.
Vinyl's largest problems are:
1). Prohibitively High Price of admission. ( New Playback Gear is Pricy )
and
2). Millennials ( the next generation of audiophiles ) are struggling with Tuition Debt as they complete their Diplomaed Education. They no longer have disposable income for Pricy Vinyl Audio gear in addition to the Digital Gear they are already able to access.
Vinyl's smaller problems include :
3). The amount of Support Gear needed
and
4). The Volume of Cubic Footage needed for the Record Storage Systems. ( what family is tolerant of the Vinyl Audiophile's 10,000 Record Collection.?)
So, you see, Vinyl has problems.
The Remaining 75,000 or so Vinyl playing people might be HighEnd Audio's smallest Minority, while Chad Kassem remains their Wonderful Higher Authority.
Where would Vinyl be without Chad breathing life into it?

What is your definition of ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:50pm
... "pricy" (or pricey) in regard to vinyl playback gear?
The first turntable and cartridge I bought (a few years before the introduction of CDs) would cost the equivalent of about $1,000 as adjusted for inflation.
At that price level, today, you can buy decent turntables from Audio-Technica, Pioneer, Pro-Ject and Rega, along with a moving-magnet cartridge from Audio-Technica, Nagaoka or Ortofon.
Or, for that same amount you could buy a complete system.
For example, an Audio-Technica AT-LP5 turntable (with cartridge included), plus a Yamaha R-N303 receiver (which also has a DAC and a network interface for streaming) and a pair of ELAC Debut 2.0 bookshelf speakers.
Such a system ought to be sufficient to tide over most millennials until they are able to afford something significantly more expensive.

Definition of Pricy:
Submitted by tonykaz on March 5, 2019 - 3:04pm
Vinyl playback is an extraordinarily pricy Hobby by comparison!
I'm talking HighEnd.
A VPI Avenger ( Comic Book Name? ) begins around $30,000! VPI is the finest turntable line I ever represented.
Arm price around $10,000
Phono Cart around $10,000 ( I'd think KOETSU )
Special Cables $ ?
Phono RIAA pre-amp $10,000 - up
A suitable stand for the Player $500 +
Vinyl record cleaning systems $ 500 +
Vinyl Record Storage Systems for 10,000 Records and the square footage to house them $100 per sq.ft. for 10 x 10 Room = $10,000
Buying Audiophile Vinyl $30/$50 each
A Vinyl System compared to a PS Audio DAC $5,000 playing Acoustic Sounds DSD downloads is far less expensive and far easier to maintain.
Committed Collectors, like the Vinyl Junkie, have lifetime collections to maintain.
New Millennials, starting fresh, may be vinyl curious but Digital presents a far wider mainstream Access to Glorious Music reproduction throughout 21st Century Life Environs.
There is a difference between Vinyl and the various Designers DACs: CHORD, PS Audio's Direct Stream, Schiit's Multibit, MSB's Analog DAC, etc. but the difference is small and the price differential is huge.
Price differential aside, Digital is an elegant solution to a complex problem.

I saw an angry old rich white guy who appeared to be an audiophile. He was pacing back and forth with a tiki torch while muttering about this new fangled "pink noise" threatening to replace the far superior "white noise." He was wearing a hat that said "MAGA" on it.
The lightbulb went off for me, right then!
Make Audio Great Again!
I think I could find y'all some of those Audio hats and you could parade around in them to the adulation of your audiophile friends!
They only come in red, however.
We could get some Polo shirts, pop the collars, and parade around audio shows. People would love us!

It would coincide with analog's resurgence in recent years, while the use of a tiki torch by some MAGA-cap wearers is probably meant to symbolize "old school" technology.

Thanks, Ortofan,

I enjoyed that video. And I do believe what Paul is saying.
However, as far as my own experience is concerned, when it comes to mid-priced equipment — the category of equipment I can afford — rather than the megabuck stuff, I feel more inner peace and long term satisfaction listening to a vinyl setup than I do a digital one, regardless of whether the former may exhibit more measurable distortion than the latter.
As good as mid-priced digital can be, from what I've heard (and there's a lot out there I haven't heard, especially when it comes to the latest generation of DACs), I still hear a blueish-grayish tint of mechanical artificiality that overlays the music, an effect that keeps me from becoming completely engaged in the music.
The mid-priced LP setup has other problems, but I still find that it sounds more natural overall than does its digital counterpart.
As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)

mid-priced vinyl rigs do sound better than their megalomaniac counterparts due to inevitable format limitations; nothing really special about megabuck digital either since digital holds no big secrets anyway. Delusions of grandeur might be a function of big money amongst others but good sound thankfully not.

"As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)"
I know it's said with a smiley-face, but I've always found it rather strange that "megabuck" price gets attached to "killer" sound quality.
Let's be honest that of course companies want (perhaps even need) this association to be made. However, I think audiophiles are recognizing that this is often not the case at all.

I meant killer in the sense...
Submitted by rschryer on March 8, 2019 - 10:31am
...of the cream of the crop, which, like anything else in life, comes at a premium.
This doesn't mean that all digital attached to a hefty price tag is going to be killer, and I wholeheartedly agree that there's some great-sounding digital out there that doesn't require mortgaging your house to own. But there's also a reason why Michael Fremer and Jason Victor Serinus bought uber-expensive gear from DCS rather than the $2500.00 offerings from Benchmark or Schitt, as good as the latter companies' goods are. Why else would these professional audio reviewers and lifelong music lovers choose to pay the big bucks?
I haven't heard DCS gear, but I trust MF's and JVS's hearing and their buying decisions.
That's the kind of "killer" I was referring to.

As someone who began reading Stereophile just before the transition from JGH to JA, I have experienced almost the whole range of John Atkinson's editorship (a short lapse during child rearing years). I have appreciated his deft hand on the tiller of Stereophile. I can only hope Jim Austin has as much success during his tenure.
Also since I began reading Stereophile in the first year of my career, I can't begrudge John the chance to step back as I will have been retired for 3 years in June.

Jim Austin. And thank heavens for that. I was recently contemplating that Atkinson must be getting ready to hand over the reigns, and was worried what with the amount of copy he seems to get these days that the successor was going to be named JVS. Don't get me wrong. JVS is a very good writer, but cut him back a little or the magazine will become the JVS Journal.

Companies reshoring manufacturing production

China is the world's manufacturing leader, but it is losing its cost advantage for American companies. While there are obstacles to bringing production back the U.S., many countries are beginning to consider it as a favorable option, according to Global Sources. Manufacturing costs may be a reason for American firms to reshore production.
China built up infrastructure and development areas and its population shifted to areas with more jobs as global demand increased, but this resulted in Chinese goods costing more, Packaging World stated. U.S. companies are no longer saving enough money to counter the impact of the delay for goods to reach stores, and this can create problems with cash flow. Reshoring shortens the length of time between production and sale. Labor costs in China will continue to increase between 15 to 20 percent per year, which will significantly reduce the cost advantage, Global Sources said. Labor only represents a fraction of manufacturing costs, and considering the price of long-distance shipping, companies may not be saving as much money through offshoring as they thought.
Reshoring challenges
Bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. is not an easy task either, though it may ultimately result in cost savings. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that by 2020, reshoring will bring between 2.5 million and 5 million jobs back to the U.S., according to Global Sources. Companies could face a shortage of skilled workers because the manufacturing industry declined in North America as production moved to Asia. Fewer young workers are pursuing factory jobs, and many workers are retiring. Reshoring experts believe the gap can be filled as organizations move stateside.
Because much of the production of American goods occurs in other countries, there can be a shortage of suppliers if companies move production back to North America, Global Sources said. Manufacturers need to determine whether their supply chains can be reconfigured before relocating production.

Supply chain risk management important to business success
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, April 30, 2013 1
As a business attempts to become more efficient, it may make its supply chain increasingly vulnerable to risk. Businesses use strategies such as outsourcing, supplier consolidation and low cost sourcing to improve efficiency, but these practices can add risk and a supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, Supply Management stated. Risk analysis in strategic sourcing is crucial, and failure to identify and minimize risks can lead to profit loss.
Ninety percent of firms fail to perform a risk assessment before outsourcing, Supply Management found. Some organizations fail to do anything more than create an annual risk register, which is usually for their insurance companies. Annual risk registers are a static assessment of risk when there are many dynamic factors at work in a global operation. The longer a supply chain is, the more vulnerable it can be to risk. Businesses often seek risk mitigation as impeding their profit strategies.
The best way to be adequately prepared for risk is to develop a proactive strategy. Dr. David Simchi-Levi of Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a new tool for supply chain management called the Risk Exposure Index. It allows managers to quantify risks in a way traditional methods did not allow, according to Supply Chain Digest. An important part of the approach involves time to recovery, a measurement of how long it would take a particular node of the supply chain to fully recover after a large disruption. Older approaches to risk mitigation did not account for completely unexpected events, like natural disasters. Understanding the impact of a major disruption to a link in a supply chain can allow businesses to be better prepared.
Procurement teams are often focused on waste reduction, supply chain performance and cost reduction, but risk preparedness can reduce total costs and protect an organization from the huge profit loss that can occur from a supply chain disruption.

Supply chains can decrease e-waste
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, April 30, 2013 0
Rapidly evolving technology has generated a great deal of electronic waste. The U.S. generates 2.5 million tons of e-waste per year and most of it is exported to other countries, according to EBN. Though plastic, glass and metal elements can be recycled, it can be a costly process, so many developed nations send old electronics to other countries where it costs less for workers to break e-waste down. The entire electronics supply chain can have a role in reducing e-waste.
Most states have laws preventing obsolete devices from being dumped in landfills, but only one-quarter of the disposed e-waste gets recycled, Bloomberg Businessweek stated. It can be difficult to properly recycle e-waste because there are toxic chemicals like lead and mercury. Developing nations have fewer regulations, and workers may not know the personal risks of handling dangerous materials. Firms that practice improper use could add to harmful pollution.
How to improve e-waste recycling
When businesses need to dispose of old devices, they must ensure they are using a certified recycler, Businessweek said. Small- and mid-size businesses are more likely to improperly dispose of electronics.
Electronics manufacturers can also reduce the amount of e-waste created each year by creating efforts to extend the lifespan of electronic components, EBN reported. If existing equipment is used longer, it will reduce churn and allow recyclers to find better ways of breaking down e-waste. Some electronics manufacturers have created refurbishment programs to rehabilitate old computers and servers, according to Businessweek.
Equipment leased to businesses is repaired and resold, preventing devices to contribute to e-waste. IBM handles 38,000 pieces of old equipment per week and is able to refurbish about 90 percent. The majority of the components are able to be reused in new devices, and only 1 percent ends up in landfills, IBM reported to Businessweek. In addition to being environmentally sound, this practice can reduce manufacturing costs.

US diesel truck emissions decreased significantly
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, April 30, 2013 0
In less than 20 years, the trucking industry has managed to cut diesel truck and heavy equipment emissions by more than 95 percent, according to new research from Randall-Reilly, a trucking marketing company. Since 1996, stricter Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations have decreased the maximum allowable diesel exhaust, changing the logistics industry. The gas releases fine particulate matter into the air, which can cause smog and public health concerns, EPA research stated.
By 2014, all off-road diesel equipment will be required to meet the stricter policies, reducing emissions in this category by 96 percent. When the new regulations are completely implemented, trucks and off-road equipment will have decreased nitrogen oxide emissions by 738,000 tons and 129,000 tons of particulate matter per year.
The regulations have effectively reduced pollution from trucking as the industry has adapted. Virtually all new trucks on the road today meet the new standards. The study said a new 18-wheeler vehicle can travel from Chicago to Baltimore without emitting more air pollution than grilling hamburgers for a family of four. The new trucks are so much cleaner it would take 60 units to match the equivalent of emissions of one from 1988.
The significant decrease in air pollution has been achieved by improving engine technologies in the following ways:
Advanced diesel fuel injection
Computerized engine controls
Improved engine air management
Upgraded exhaust filters to contain particulate matter
Reduction of sulfur levels in diesel fuel
The EPA stated some older diesel trucks are not subject to new regulations and may be on the road for another 25 to 30 years, but they can be retrofitted with pollution controls and cleaner diesel fuel can reduce emissions. Logistics will remain an important industry as manufacturing increases, and providers adapt by moving toward more sustainable practices.

Lower commodity costs could benefit manufacturers
Strategic Sourceror on Monday, April 29, 2013 0
The drop in gold prices and general weakness in commodity prices could be an indication that economic growth is slowing, Forbes reported. China is expressing less demand for raw materials and manufacturing orders have dropped. The European Union is undergoing austerity measures to battle the recession. Recently, the International Monetary Fund reduced its global growth forecast for the year from 3.5 percent to 3.3 percent, citing economic weakness in Europe as an impediment to worldwide growth. In the U.S., inflation predications from producer and consumer price indexes are less than expected.
The relatively low inflation rates have hurt the price of gold and other precious metals. Gold is currently 28 percent away from its record high. Other commodities have suffered as well with crude oil and corn both experiencing significant drops.
Though economists are concerned about the impact the drop in commodity prices will have on the economy's recovery, the lower costs could be beneficial to manufacturers and sourcing companies, according to NBC News. The decrease in commodity costs has affected a wide range of raw materials used in production. Copper, a versatile metal used in electronics and construction, is at an 18 month low because of the reduced demand in China, and iron and steel prices dropped as well. This lowers production costs in many different industries, from steel beams used in buildings to auto parts, the source reported. Food manufacturers and the clothing industry have also benefited from the reduced price of commodities.
While demand for raw materials may not be as be high, U.S. exports to Asia remain strong. The American auto industry is experiencing an increase of exports to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, NBC News stated. Despite economic slowdowns in Europe and China, some economists do not expect U.S. exports to suffer.

Android's Best Feature Hits the iPhone

Google Now is quite possibly Android’s greatest, and creepiest, feature. It provides “context-aware” alerts, meaning it picks up on your patterns and habits better than most loved ones. Within days of using it, Google Now will start alerting you when you need to leave for work, when packages you’ve ordered will arrive, and how quickly you need to leave for your next office meeting. All without you ever telling it anything.
To those who have used Google Now, it has quickly become an indispensable resource, in both their personal lives and their business routines. And it was Android-only, giving Droid users something to hold over Apple iPhone-users heads. Until today.
In an update to the company’s existing Google Search app for the Apple iPhone and iPad, Google has now added in the majority of features of Google Now, including Siri-competing Google voice searching. Some of the more mundane features did not make it over, however. Android users have the ability to display their airline boarding passes, Fandango movie tickets, and a daily activity summary. The iOS version of Google Now does not, though the airline passes and movie tickets can be found in Apple’s own Passbook app. Other low-level functions – local event notifications and recent research topics – didn’t make the Apple cut either, but the big winners; the traffic alerts, the weather, and breaking news stories that you find topical -- all the things designed to make your personal and work life easier -- are definitely there.
If you are graced (cursed?) with an iOS device, head to the iTunes store now to download the new version of Google Search.

Samsung Galaxy S4 experiencing supply chain disruptions
Strategic Sourceror on Monday, April 29, 2013 0
The brand new Samsung Galaxy S4 is encountering higher demand than anticipated. Sprint and T-Mobile announced the smartphones will go on sale later than expected due to delays in shipments, Sky News reported.
Sprint will offer the S4 on its website, and has not announced when the phone will first appear in stores, CNET stated. T-Mobile delayed its launch by five days, and the mobile provider will only be selling the device online. Verizon originally planned to begin offering the S4 on May 30, Sky News said.
Samsung warned the phone may initially be hard to find because of the high level of global demand. The company expects to fulfill demand within a few weeks, according to CNET.
Increased popularity creating new supply problems for Samsung
The new Galaxy model was unveiled in New York last month as Samsung continues to compete with Apple, Sky News said. The South Korean mobile company overtook Apple as the world's largest smartphone provider, boosted by sales of the Galaxy S3. The company reported shipping more than 40 million units of the S3 since its launch last May.
Supply problems have often delayed launches of popular smartphones, especially Apple's iPhone. However, Samsung has traditionally been good about providing adequate inventory before a launch, CNET stated. The Samsung Galaxy line proved to rival the iPhone, and now it is experiencing a similar problem with delays.
"Supply chain management is a core differentiator for our brand," said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America, according to CNET. "It's part of our DNA."
Part of the reason Samsung has historically been more adept at meeting demand than some of its competitors is because many of the components used in its phones are manufactured in house, decreasing reliance on outside suppliers, CNET said.
Nearly every wireless carrier globally committed to selling the S4.

Panama Canal expansion will change shipping industry
Strategic Sourceror on Monday, April 29, 2013 0
The expansion of the Panama Canal will allow higher capacity cargo ships from Asia to travel through the channels, Progressive Railroading stated. The project is scheduled for completion in 2015, and the added capacity will allow more foreign trade.
"In the future, we foresee trade growing between Asia and Latin America, where Panama also has a significant competitive advantage due to its unique geographical position at the nexus of the Americas," Jorge Quijano, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority said to Port Technology. "With East Asia sourcing more and more raw materials out of Latin America, in particular coal and iron ore, the expanded Canal will offer enormous new opportunities."
The expansion could cause a reduction in the number of U.S. air cargo centers with the increase to marine shipping capabilities, Air Cargo World reported. However, the rise in container shipping will lead to upgraded ports and expanded railroads and trucking networks. It will likely create many changes for supply chain management as shipping methods shift from air to sea and land.
Large scale expansion
The project has been focused on the widening and deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific approaches, the addition of new locks and deepening the Culebra cut - the Canal's narrowest point, which required four dry excavation projects, according to Port Technology. The expansion will allow much bigger carriers of up to 13,000 standard 20-foot units (TEUs) to safely pass through the canal, Trucking Info said. The current capability of the waterway is vessels of 5,000 TEU or less.
Quijano added this will enable suppliers to reduce operating costs and carbon emissions, as well as increase speed of delivery because fewer ships will be able to transport greater amounts of cargo. Another objective of the expansion is to cut down use of freshwater.
Implications for North American logistics
Air Cargo World said within three to five years, there will only be six major air cargo hubs in the U.S. Hubs in Southern and mid-Atlantic states will have the advantage to remain significant as inland railroad and trucking networks build up to meet increased shipments to Gulf and East Coast ports. There is potential for development of smaller air cargo centers, and ports with links to air cargo hubs may have an advantage because shipments will not experience delays.
Railroads are collaborating with ports to upgrade before the completion of the canal expansion in 2015. Florida East Coast Railway (FEC), the only rail provider to southern Florida's sea ports, is working with Port Everglades and Port Miami to build on-dock rail facilities as these ports will likely experience an increase of cargo traffic, Progressive Railroading said. The connection of the railroad to Port Miami has been suspended since hurricane damage in 2005.
"By summer 2014, we'll have the on-dock rail facility fully operational, which means that from Port Miami, we can hit 70 percent of the American population in a matter of days," Port Miami director Bill Johnson told Progressive Railroading.
He added Port Miami will have an advantage because the Atlantic exit of the Panama Canal will be deepened to 50 feet, and Miami is the southernmost East Coast port at that depth. Port Miami anticipates an upturn in traffic and profits by the end of 2015.
Expanded sea port shipments will create a demand for increased trucking networks. Trucking Info stated the industry has the capability to adapt to increased demand, and container transport will be dictated by ocean carriers and ports. The trucking industry does not predict there will be difficulties in meeting the rise in shipments. The Panama Canal is expanding to such a degree that it will have a large impact on logistics, but inland networks are working to upgrade.

Bangladesh factory collapse brings manufacturing safety concerns to light
Strategic Sourceror on Friday, April 26, 2013 0
The collapse of an eight-story garment factory in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is drawing attention to unsafe working conditions in Asian facilities. At least 700 factory workers have died in building collapses and fires in the Dhaka region alone in the past decade, CNN reported, and most of these deaths could have been prevented by following safety regulations. Manufacturing costs are much lower in Asia, particularly because Bangladesh has the cheapest labor, but sourcing companies may need to investigate the quality of conditions in their overseas facilities.
Bangladesh boasts a $20 billion garment industry that supplies retailers around the world with low cost clothing. This industry accounts for more than 80 percent of the country's exports and has created four million jobs, BBC said. Garment factories have provided a great deal of employment to women living below the poverty line. Low cost of labor and fiscal advantages such as duty-free import of fabrics have made Bangladesh an attractive manufacturing destination for retail suppliers. However, safety regulations are sometimes ignored as corporations pursue cost savings objectives. North American companies are subject to more safety inspections, according to CNN, but conditions can be more difficult to monitor when production has been sent offshore to Asia.
"In my view, 50 percent of garment factories are located on premises which are not safe," Bangladeshi senior government official Mainuddin Khondker told BBC. He also admit no action has been taken against factory owners or landlords for safety violation or inadequate fire preparation. The garment industry has created so many jobs in Bangladesh that the local government is reluctant to get involved. The most recent major incident before the collapse was a fire in November in a factory with no fire exits, CNN reported.
Demand for low cost clothing remained high, especially during the recession. CNN said businesses need to be responsible for ensuring factory employees in offshore facilities are working in safe conditions.

Google Glass: For Business?
Nicholas Hamner on Friday, April 26, 2013 0

Much has been made of Google Glass in the buildup since they were announced, and the attention has certainly ramped up this week, as the first “Explorer Edition” frames land in the hands of a carefully curated list of users. If you’re unfamiliar, Google Glass is the search giant’s foray into wearable electronics, mashing together a flexible eyeglass frame, a trick Bluetooth earpiece, and a projector aimed square at the wearer’s retina to broadcast data from the user’s smartphone – sort of a PIP for real life.
Whether this technology revolutionizes the market like the Apple iPhone or comes to occupy that impressive-tech-but-extremely-dorky space it will share with the Segway will be fleshed out when the product comes to mass market, but for now, let’s look at what Google is showing and if the device has any forseeable business uses.
Short answer: No. Long answer: Maybe, but probably no.
To explain, here’s a quick rundown of the voice commands you’ll be able to use with Google Glass and their functions:
“Google”: Search for something
“Take a Picture”: Use the built-in 8MP camera on the frame to take a point-of-view (POV) photograph
“Record a Video”: Use the built-in camera to record a 720p video. By default, it will record 10 seconds. To record longer, you manually tap the side of the glasses’ frame.
“Get Directions To”: Use your smartphone’s GPS to plot your course, displaying a 3D map into the glasses’ video window
“Send a Message To”: Use your smartphone to send a text message
“Make a Call To”: Use the built-in earpiece and microphone to voice-dial a person
“Hang Out With”: Tied to Google’s own Google+ social network, this allows you to do a video chat with your contacts in Google+, with their video feed appearing within the glasses’ video window
So, as it stands now, Google Glass is an eye-mounted extension of your smartphone and its current business uses are limited to showing Google Now updates for upcoming meetings. There’s no ability to speak to schedule a new announcement, or capture a photo and instantly email it to someone. There’s not even the ability to surreptitiously watch YouTube cat videos or check ESPN from a drawn–out meeting.
Google has released an API for Google Glass, meaning the code is out there for other developers to produce new features for it, so the day may come where you can stare at a document, your phone will recognize it, and allow you to make edits without ever touching a keyboard or grabbing your phone. Or you might be able to look at a product’s bar code on your shelf and instantly tie in to your company’s inventory system. Or, y’know, the whole cat video thing.
The door is certainly wide open for Google Glass to become an indispensable tool for daily life and work, and it’s absolutely a cool looking piece of equipment (as opposed to, say, the Segway). But it’s work-related uses are pretty limited right now, meaning the $1,500 you have to drop to get one will almost never qualify as a business expense.

Trucking industry to increase natural gas use
Strategic Sourceror on Friday, April 26, 2013 2
Natural gas is becoming more available in the U.S., and the trucking industry is taking note. Many shipping companies are switching from petroleum to natural gas, The New York Times reported. Cummins, a truck engine manufacturer, began shipping new natural gas-powered engines that allow trucks to make longer trips.
Natural gas burns cleaner than conventional fuel, which will allow trucks to meet stricter emissions standards, according to the newspaper. It is less expensive than petroleum, and with the shale boom in the U.S., supply chain managers will be less vulnerable to geopolitical disturbances that can impact the cost of oil. However, many trucking companies have been slow to make the switch because natural gas vehicles are too expensive for suppliers to see immediate cost savings, and many gas stations did not have refueling capabilities. Other truck manufacturers plan to introduce natural gas engines, and Clean Energy Fuels added 70 fill up stations along major truck routes, the news outlet stated.
Large companies like Walmart, Proctor & Gamble and Nike have been adding natural gas trucks to their fleets. The latest major corporation to announce a move toward sustainability, UPS, plans to add 700 new vehicles to its fleet and build four refueling stations by the end of 2014, Reuters said. The project will give UPS one of largest natural gas fleets in the world, and the corporation listed lower greenhouse gas emissions as a motivator, as well as cheaper cost of fuel and accessibility of resources. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions found natural gas vehicles can reduce emissions by as much as 55 percent.
The New York Times reported many experts predict the number of natural gas trucks will continue to increase, particularly in the U.S. where fuel prices are relatively low.

Manufacturing growth slow in April
Strategic Sourceror on Thursday, April 25, 2013 0
Factory activity continues to expand, though it grew at its slowest rate in the past six months, based on preliminary data from the April Markit Flash U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). While economic growth decelerated, manufacturing did increase slightly. The Markit PMI has been in line with other surveys on economic growth.
The slower pace is mostly attributed to a decrease in new domestic orders, though the market for exports rose at a stronger rate than the previous month, according to the report. There was a solid increase in manufacturing employment, but it was the lowest rise since November. Some economists speculate the drop is due to concerns of the impact the government sequester will have on the cost of manufacturing, reported the Chicago Tribune.
"The biggest monthly fall in the PMI since June 2010 raises concerns that the U.S. manufacturing expansion is losing momentum rapidly as businesses and households worry about the impact of tax hikes and government spending cuts," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. "The PMI suggests that output growth has slowed from an annual pace approaching 8 percent earlier in the year to only 2 percent at the start of the second quarter." He added exports were spurring the growth of the manufacturing sector as domestic orders decrease.
The economy still on path to recovery
While some may the stagnation as a negative sign for economic recovery, the housing market has strengthened. The Commerce Department found new home sales increased by 417,000 units in March, the Chicago Tribune stated. The housing sector will likely continue to grow at a slow pace as well. Housing sales have slowed slightly because of a lack of new home availability in many regions. The housing market does not seem to have been as affected by the sequester as the manufacturing industry.

Learning From AMD's Mistakes
Nicholas Hamner on Wednesday, April 24, 2013 0
If you know a little bit about computers, then you’ve probably heard of AMD. Advanced Micro Devices is the #2 producer of computer processors, in terms of scale, and is far behind #1 producer Intel. In an in-depth pair of articles produced earlier this week, Ars Technica chronicled the company’s rise and fall in the technology industry, and some of their failings sound really familiar.
AMD Did Not Control Spending
The article is full of quotes from former execs and analysts who have watched AMD get battered in the marketplace. Atiq Raza, the company’s former president, CTO, and COO is quoted as saying “There’s no control on spending”. Raza left the company after a dispute with AMD founder and then-CEO Jerry Sanders, when the latter decided to build an unneeded fabrication plant in Germany using borrowed money.
The article details how the AMD sales team was adorned in Rolexes and were encouraged to spend loosely, then mentions a New York Times article from 1989 detailing the company’s less-than-thrifty habits. Finally, it lists Raza recounting an early, foreboding discussion with Sanders. Sanders states “I have always spent more than I make”, leading Raza to respond with “I hope you don’t do it at AMD”, then recounting that Sanders, in fact, did.
AMD Did Not Have a Strategic Plan
AMD’s former CFO, Fran Barton, recalled how the company went from one near-disaster to another seemingly every other week. He tells that Mondays would be full of reports citing dropping yield and financial catastrophe, which would be resolved by the end of the week. Each time, he said, Sanders firmly delegated assignments that would lead to the next weeks’ flame ups. In the dust-up that saw the departure of Raza, when the German fabrication plant was ordered, Raza is quoted saying “I told him: don’t do it. I put the orders on hold. He didn’t tell me and accelerated the entire process.”
AMD Was Inefficient
The fab facilities that led to Raza’s departure also cast a heavy weight on the company’s bottom line. Each facility cost billions of dollars, funded on the future sales of processors, and AMD produced over demand and under capacity, costing them money on both ends through excess inventory and less-than-optimized production facilities.
The article lists the problems that accompanied AMD’s acquisition of ATI in 2006. Ian McNaughton, AMD’s former marketing manager, is quoted saying that the ideas of combining processors and graphics companies made sense, but their implementation failed, saying “This was an acquisition treated like a merger. AMD people were AMD people; ATI people were ATI people.”
From poorly managed spending, to poor planning and strategizing, to poor business processes, AMD inflicted a number of ills against itself as reported in the Ars Technica series, and every organization should see a bit of themselves in them and learn a valuable lesson.

Levi's built worker well-being and sustainability into supply chain
Strategic Sourceror on Wednesday, April 24, 2013 1
Levi Straus and Co. has used the trend toward sustainability and listening to the voice of its workers to improve supply chain management, according to GreenBiz.com. Levi's new approach involves improving worker well-being by ensuring they have opportunities for economic empowerment, good health, family security, equality, access to education and a safe working environment.
Companies are beginning to pay attention to how worker satisfaction can impact business profits, GreenBiz stated. If factory employees are dissatisfied, it can lead to turnover, absenteeism and worker strikes, all of which can have a negative impact on the success of a supply chain. Focusing on worker well-being can benefit employees in developing nations, but it can also prevent a loss of profits or disruptions to the supply chain.
Finding sustainable products has become a growing concern for consumers, and Levi's has made efforts to reduce its environmental impact. In 2006, Levi's commissioned an assessment of their products to determine use of resources, said MainStreet. The report found the company was utilizing water inefficiently with 42 liters used in the finishing process alone, so Levi's released a collection of jeans that used the same materials, but 96 percent less water. This initiative has saved 172 million liters of water, according to a blog at Alabama.com.
The move toward sustainability can improve brand image since many consumers seek environmental and social information before purchasing a product. Companies used to see this approach as less profitable, the blog revealed, but 71 percent of consumers consider the environment when shopping and four in five Millennials would switch brands for a good cause. Businesses can educate consumers about sustainability if they speak out about their environmental goals. Large corporations can have a great deal of influence, so they are the ones who can impact global sustainability efforts.

Flooding causes delays in river traffic
Strategic Sourceror on Wednesday, April 24, 2013 0
The U.S. Coast Guard is considering placing shipping restrictions on the Illinois River after severe flooding led to closing of several locks and barge accidents, according to Reuters. The natural disaster occurred three months after the Mississippi River was nearly closed because the water level was at a record low. Dozens of locks along Mississippi and Illinois have been closed until the water levels withdraw.
On Saturday, 114 barges broke free from a fleeting area on the Mississippi River near St. Louis due to the high water levels, and 11 barges filled with coal sank. A section of the river was closed to allow salvage crews to recover the wreckage. On the Illinois River, a loose barge struck a dam, and the damage cannot be assessed until the water recedes, reported Reuters.
"We're looking at all options to get navigation flowing again," said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Colin Fogarty to Reuters. "However, until we can get the surveyors and the salvors out onto the scene it is difficult to say how soon we can get the river back open."
The flooding may continue to impact distribution supply chains and could lead to commodity price increases. Cash offered to grain and soybean farmers dropped because of the barge stoppages, according to Reuters. Sixty percent of the grain grown in the U.S. is shipped along the Mississippi, so suppliers have tried to find alternative methods. Prices for barge shipments from the Gulf of Mexico have risen, and the Coast Guard has no estimate for when river shipping operations may return to normal.
The Mississippi River may rise further before cresting, said the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. More rain is expected, which could continue to affect river closures. Reuters reported some of the locks may be closed until early May.

Procurement Transformation
Strategic Sourcing is Finally Becoming a Household Term
William Dorn on Wednesday, April 24, 2013 0
Everyone is busy! 2012 was a busy year. The first quarter of 2013 hasn't broken the trend; in fact, it seems that activity only continues to increase. Across the board, people are busy, particularly procurement and sourcing groups.
I'm not just making blanket statements to make people feel better about the long hours they've been putting in and the stress they've been dealing with lately. We actually are seeing the direct impact of the increased workload amongst our own staff. If you hadn’t heard, demand for our services are so strong that we recently outgrew our facilities. When I say everyone is busy, I base it on a new trend that we’ve seen in the last 24 months. That new trend is that everyone is asking for help.
Ten years ago, when I started with Source One, I maybe knew about 3 people outside of this company that had ever even heard the term "strategic sourcing" before. As you can imagine, selling a product that people had never heard of before was a challenge. Companies like ours spent time looking for that forward-thinking C-Level executive that "got it" and tried to convince them to push us down into the ranks of individuals controlling spend. That tactic almost universally met resistance. You've got the procurement and sourcing folks that were proud of the results they just negotiated, and felt threatened. You've got the process folks who wanted to tell you how the three-bid process them implemented saved millions, and there was no other way to do it. You had the marketing managers crying that we didn't understand advertising or media buying, the IT directors telling us that you couldn't improve pricing on products that had no competition in the marketplace, the shop floor managers telling us how only X brand filters would fit in their equipment, and the dozens of 20-year veterans that wanted no parts of someone that might ask any questions about how things had been done in the past. The list of complaints and excuses goes on and on.
Things slowly started to change. The term "strategic sourcing" started to become a bit more recognizable. In the mid-2000s, we saw more and more companies begin to adopt their own internal sourcing groups or processes. We saw more companies get focused on vendor relationships and understanding the total cost of a product or service purchase. But, many companies still thought sourcing was a "three bid and a buy", and across the board, most companies still felt challenged by anyone that suggested that there might be a better way of doing things.
Then the recession hit. Companies scrambled. People were let go. Departments, divisions, job functions and responsibilities all consolidated. Globally, companies cut spending, but often blindly, without a future vision.
Companies did what they needed to do to survive, but over time, they eventually started spending again. But beyond just spending, they started to also look at how and why they were spending. Even the companies that didn’t suffer in the recession started to become more aware of the way they handled purchases and procurement, and the way they chose their suppliers. Companies got smarter about sourcing and their overall supply chain. They started to find experts, whether in house or through services like Source One offers, and started to identify ways to reduce costs. Companies started to get serious about looking at how they spend. Companies began to move beyond the three-bid process. Companies began to realize that a software tool or an electronic catalog alone wasn’t going to produce the best-in-class results they needed. Executives started to mandate improvements in terms of hard dollar and soft dollar cost reduction, increases in service levels and improvements in payment terms.
That’s when things really started to get busy. Companies finally became aware of the internal goldmine of savings opportunities that existed and put the pressure on their teams to achieve it. However, it doesn’t always make sense to blindly throw staff into every spend category, nor did it make sense to hire internal staff experts for categories that may only get sourced once every three years.
So a major shift happened; “Strategic Sourcing” became a household term. Those same people that for the last ten years fought the very idea of a consultant involved in their spending now embraced it. I’d love to take credit and say that the book we wrote changed the industry’s perception of sourcing, but that wasn’t it. And it wasn’t purely the fact that executives started throwing challenging or sometimes unrealistic savings targets at department managers and expected them to perform… No, it was that the sourcing function finally started to earn the respect that it deserved for the last 20 years.
So it started to make sense now. Those individuals that fought tooth and nail to keep consultants out of their spend categories didn’t do it because they were lazy, inherently bad at their jobs, or were just waiting for retirement. They did it because they knew, that in almost every case, the work that they HAD been doing was not respected. They knew that the results produced in a collaborative engagement with a consultant would reflect poorly on them; because their own managers and colleagues didn’t understand what it was that they did every day. They knew that working with a consultant would pull them away from the dozens of other high priority projects they had going on, and they knew that would also reflect poorly on them.
But, things have finally changed. Procurement and Sourcing are becoming highly respected within their organization. The shift has been so drastic, that the stigma of working with a consultant has disappeared. In fact, the majority of the phone calls we receive are now coming directly from people that control spend, not from executives trying to force us down into their organizations. Spend managers have been tasked to do more with less. In this case, produce results, but don’t add payroll, and it has caused an absolutely boom in this niche consulting industry.
But the education of the strategic sourcing function still has a ways to go. Some companies are now just starting to understand that strategic sourcing is not just a cost-focused function. Bleeding-edge companies have already started to build out their own Shared Services groups, with sourcing teams playing a critical role. Those same companies are staffing their Shared Services teams with a combination of the right internal people, outsourced resources, tools and market intelligence – regardless of it they are home grown or outsourced. Interestingly, the companies that we see incorporating strategic sourcing into their culture are the companies that are strongly outperforming their competition. They realize strategic sourcing can serve a critical function in identifying the right products, services, partners and suppliers to align themselves with to ensure success. Further, by having the right individuals assisting with market research, sourcing, interviewing and selection of those solutions, they can free their own subject matters up to focus on the job functions that they are best performing. A properly formed Shared Services team takes the best skills from each stakeholder and ultimately delivers a result than no individual person or SME group could have achieved on their own.
While traditionally thought of as a procurement function, the evolution of Strategic Sourcing is a cross-functional team that can appropriately support and improve organizational business needs. It’s an exciting time in our industry now, because more and more companies are starting to “get it”, and those people within your companies that have been fighting for the last 20 years to get their heads above water are starting to finally earn the respect that they deserve.

Facility Management Nearshoring Source One News
Source One Opens New Corporate Headquarters
Alexa Guidone on Tuesday, April 23, 2013 0
Source One Management Services, LLC is proud to announce its relocation to its new corporate headquarters located at 1015 N York Road in Willow Grove, PA. The facility offers the space needed to accommodate the company’s record growth over the past two years.
The new headquarters offers a near doubling of total square footage which manifests in 1.5 times more private offices, a doubling of private workspaces, and a quadrupling of meeting spaces in terms of both conference rooms and shared work spaces for collaboration between Source One’s many teams of sourcing professionals. This collaboration is furthered by the campus’ high tech outfitting, which includes an infrastructure and device setup that facilitates personal and team mobility, 65” displays scattered throughout the building accessible by any device in seconds for brainstorming sessions, and screamingly fast data connections throughout the facility allowing instant access to the specially designed central data stores. The headquarters will also contain the resources necessary to maintain Source One-developed WhyAbe.com, the first and only free e-sourcing tool platform for buyers and suppliers to run and participate in RFx and reverse auction events.
“In 1992, Source One started with three guys working out of a makeshift office. As we grew over the years, our office needs grew with us. But having experienced the rapid expansion we have over the past few years, we got to the point where we were elbow-to-elbow before our office space could grow with us. This new facility should give us the room we need to work and grow for the near future” said Vice President of Operations William Dorn.
The move comes as Source One’s traditional strategic sourcing services, which help companies in all types of industries improve supplier quality and service while lowering costs, are in record demand. Growing demand comes from an increased interest in the fields of domestic reshoring and nearshoring into Central and South America, IT and technology spending, supply chain optimization and streamlining, and decision support.
Source One operates as an extension to the sourcing teams for companies throughout the world, an industry that is in particularly high demand in the post-recession.

Companies are less prepared for risk
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, April 23, 2013 0
Companies are struggling with risk analysis in strategic sourcing, according to a recent report from Aon Risk Solutions. The report found companies are overall less prepared for risk.
Some of the findings included:
Among the top risks for companies were economic slowdown, regulatory changes, increasing competition and business interruption
Political uncertainties entered the top 10 for the first time. Global companies may source from different countries, and social unrest can cause disruptions in the supply chain
Aon reported that 2013 had more respondents than ever, which could be an indication that companies are growing more concerned with risk management
Weather and natural disasters are predicted to enter the top 10 risks by 2016, meaning may companies may be adapting their procurement strategies in the next three years
"One possible explanation of the decline in risk readiness could be that the prolonged economic recovery has strained organizations's resources, thus hampering the abilities to mitigate many of these risks," said Stephen Cross, chairman of Aon Global Risk Consulting. "Our survey revealed that, despite diverse geographies, companies across the globe shared surprisingly similar views on the risks we are facing today - whether or not they feel prepared."
Organizations that understand risk management is not just part of the business but a means to improve the organization can drive their bottom line, according to Supply Chain Digest. Fifty percent of a company's value can come from outside suppliers, so procurement adaptability is important to the success of managing risks. Early risk identification can be a method for minimizing the impacts of changes to a supply chain. Supply Chain Digest notes many companies prioritize risks to identify which components of a supply chain have the potential to cause the biggest disruption and focus on taking action when necessary. As processes change, the ability to adapt is critical.

Kroger commits to sustainably sourcing palm oil
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, April 23, 2013 0
Palm oil accounts for approximately one-third of the world's vegetable oil production and is used in many foods and cosmetic products. The Kroger Corporation announced it would commit to sustainable strategic sourcing for 100 percent of the palm oil used in its production supply chain by 2015.
Some organizations have grown concerned about the use of palm oil in products because if it is not sourced responsibly, it can cause deforestation, greenhouse gas emission and loss of habitat for indigenous tribes and endangered species, according to Asian Correspondent. About 80 percent of the world's palm oil is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, and is mainly used by multinational Western corporations. Malaysia has taken strides to reduce the environmental impacts of palm oil production by committing to maintain the forest cover of 50 percent of its land, while producing half of the world's RSPO certified sustainable palm oil. The increase in palm oil use came after changes in regulations for labeling products containing unsaturated fat.
"For the products we self-manufacture, we are proud to already source exclusively from suppliers who are RSPO members, working toward certification," said Calvin Kaufman, Kroger's group vice president of manufacturing. "Our plants are modeling the way for our third-party suppliers."
Kroger has committed to assisting their third-party suppliers in making the switch to sustainably sourced palm oil. The corporation will disclose its progress toward sustainability in its annual report and will support public policy initiatives for preventing palm oil production from expanding in rainforest territories.
While palm oil continues to grow in popularity, many consumers are becoming concerned with the effects of climate change and other negative environmental impacts. Many corporations are beginning to take precautions to ensure the palm oil used in their products is responsibly sourced.

Happy Earth Day!
Alexa Guidone on Monday, April 22, 2013 0
In celebration of Earth Day here are 5 easy tips you can utilize in your every day life to do your part to contribute in preserving the environment. By implementing a few of these easy changes into your daily routine you can not only save money but also contribute to creating a healthier environment.
Look for foods with little or no packaging which has a two-fold benefit; healthier foods like fruits and vegetables tend to be packaged with minimal materials leading to less packaging waste which makes up about one-third of non-industrial solid waste.
Utilize perennial crops which often have extensive roots systems made for retaining water which in turn help prevent soil erosion. Perennial's also grow back each year making them a great investment for your garden.
Plan meals to cook in bulk then freeze for use later on, this method utilizes less energy during cooking and also helps prevent food waste. Its also a great solution for freeing up more time in the evening during the hectic work week
Use refillable bags at the grocery store and refillable water containers at home and in the office. Its an easy solution that significantly helps cut back on packaging waste.
Educate yourself. Green does not always guarantee sustainability. For example Hybrid cars by definition are not sustainable as they still utilize oil based fuels and contain parts that are not easily recyclable and can be often toxic to the environment. While the impact is less than that of a regular vehicle, using a bicycle is true sustainability.
There are number of things you can do to make daily living more sustainable, often it is as simple as turning off a light. Take a few minutes to see where you can implement these and other tips into your lifestyle to do your part in contributing to the world around us.

Top Four: Reasons To Leave Asia
Nicholas Hamner on Monday, April 22, 2013 0
History is full of quotes and advice that seem to become more valuable as time passes. “Never get in a land war in Asia” is a popular one. “Don’t mess around with Jim” is also pretty solid. But, for businesses, “To save money, move production to Asia” has seemingly stood above the rest for what seems like a very long time, holding true for decades.
But that advice is shaky now, and here is a quartet of reasons you should get manufacturing out of Asia.
Reason 1: Intellectual Property Concerns
According to a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, the results of which were released last month, a quarter of American businesses doing business in China have been victims of data theft, losing proprietary data and trade secrets due to cyber attacks. The problem has spiked in recent years, according to an article at ZDNet, and more difficult to trace as thieves storing their information on solid state hard drives are able to cleanly delete all evidence, whereas older magnetic disc drives kept remnants of old information even after several deletions. Relocating manufacturing to North America, and the intellectual property laws held by all of its resident governments, is quickly becoming a preferred solution.
Reason 2: Labor Concerns
“Well,” you might be thinking, “The product might get knocked off, but at least it’s manufactured cheaply.” If you believe a recent report from AlixPartners, that reasoning won’t be valid for too much longer. The report states that, by 2015, the total landed cost of a product built in Asia will equal that of a product built in the U.S.. While rising labor costs in big production countries like China bear some of the concern, the real cost bloat is in the transportation across the Pacific, particularly the fuel going into the boat.
Reason 3: Climate Risks
In 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami (and potential nuclear meltdown) combined to devastate Japan, a shortage developed for key technology components. Everything from iPads, to laptops, to video game discs, to video projectors quickly became hard to find. Later that year, when Thailand flooded, computer hard drives became scarce. While both countries eventually recovered, even a week's
delay can render financial harm to a business.
Asia has fallen victim to two devastating tsunamis in the past decade, is home to half of the largest active volcanoes in the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, is in constant earthquake danger due to its active tectonic plates, and has recently witnessed a higher flooding risk during the monsoon season due to global warming. For this reason, many companies are looking to other low-cost manufacturing centers in safer environments, like Mexico.
Reason 4: Political Climate Risks

Boston law enforcement search slowed down deliveries
Strategic Sourceror on Monday, April 22, 2013 0
As the manhunt for the remaining suspect in Boston Marathon was carried out, it had an effect on deliveries to and from the city. Officials shut down transportation, hospitals and other services in Boston and its suburbs on Friday, and all residents were urged to stay in their homes with the doors locked. All truckers heading into the Boston metropolitan area for a delivery or pick up were told to contact a dispatcher to find out if the business was open, according to The Trucker.
No highways were closed, although all traffic in the Watertown area was suspended, according to CNN. All modes of mass transit including trains, buses and ferries were shut down on Friday morning, and businesses were asked not to open on Friday. Authorities recommended residents of Watertown, Newton, Arlington, Waltham, Belmont, Cambridge and the Allston-Brighton neighborhoods of Boston to stay home. At least a quarter of a million people live in the affected areas, according to The Trucker. The announcement came after one of the suspects and a university police officer were fatally wounded in a clash, which occurred shortly after the FBI released photos of the suspects.
FedEx and United Parcel Service also reported there may be delays in the Boston Area last week, according to Fox Business. FedEx reported disruptions could occur in several metropolitan areas, but the company was trying to put contingency plans in place to resume regular service. UPS's website said its service guarantee does not apply when transportation networks are disturbed by forces outside its control, though the company was trying to operate through accessible roadways. Many shipping companies prepare strategies for natural disasters, but unexpected events can present different challenges for logistics.

Richie Rich in Technology
Leigh Merz on Friday, April 19, 2013 0
It bewilders me when people will spend hundreds to millions of dollars on adding a little bling to their hardware…and I do not mean household items or everyday necessities. I am talking about cell phones and tablets.
Today I looked for a new cover for my Kindle Fire and found a very pretty floral Vera Bradley case but it was $39. Yes it is stylish, but it was a piece of cotton and cardboard that I could make myself. Designers today are expanding their product lines marketing all different avenues including technology. You can find covers and cases from Disney to Harley Davidson and even a little bedazzle with Swarovski crystal...Hello Kitty Swarovski crystal to be exact. I understand the pricing for these items falls within reason to today’s baseline pricing, but what about Stuart Hughes Black Diamond iPhone 5 selling for $15.3 Million! This Iced-Out phone includes an inlay of 600 white diamonds, asolid gold Apple logo surrounded by 53 white diamonds, 135 grams of 24-caratgold and sapphire glass for the screen. As for the black diamond, the stonereplaced the iPhone's home button.
Doesn’t this defeat the purpose of a phone case? It should function as a means of protection from damage not an open invitation to steal it. The cost of the bling is worth more than the actual hardware and technology used to develop the device.
I forgot to mention that I bought my current Kindle Fire cover at Five Below for $5 after sourcing it with several different retailers. It has the exact same interior and functionality as the Vera Bradley one I saw today. As discussed above, retailers in every industry are broadening their designs to the technology industry which allows consumers to purchase trendy accessories at reasonable prices. Below are a few other places I looked before making my purchase:
· E-Commerce Channels – Amazon/eBay
· Book Stores
· Flea Markets – you can find almost any style phone and tablet equipment cases and covers for under $5. These are designer inspired and there is always room for negotiation with these vendors.
My final thoughts are even if you can afford a diamond encrusted phone cover, why not spend the money on a more purposeful product like an $890,000 Stuart Hughes suit! This will really boost the US economy.

Cost of manufacturing in China approaching US level
Strategic Sourceror on Friday, April 19, 2013 0
The United States is gaining a competitive edge for manufacturers as costs rise in China, according to a new study from consulting firm AlixPartners. China was previously seen as the cheapest location for offshore manufacturing, but the research found production costs in China and the U.S. would be equal by 2015.
The price to ship goods from China to other areas of the world is high. As worker conditions improved, the cost of labor increased, and Chinese currency gained value, meaning much of the competitive advantage of manufacturing in China has disappeared, according to CNBC. Manufacturers knew rising costs would be a risk they would have to face eventually, but they did not know how quickly it would happen.
Approximately 58 percent of the participants in the AlixPartners survey said production had already been nearshored or was being considered for insourcing. Thirty-seven percent of manufacturing executives said the U.S. would be their location of choice for moving production.
Moving manufacturing requires cost analysis
The survey found Mexico and India may be attractive destinations for companies because cost of manufacturing is cheaper and has increased at a much slower rate than China. However, AlixPartners warns companies to carefully consider product type, location, transportation and cost of raw materials before deciding to nearshore.
"Without question, these are absolutely critical decisions for company leaders," said Foster Finley, AlixPartners managing director. "When it comes to moving production, companies should look twice before they leap. "Not only do product-cost variables vary widely by product type, but several factors, such as exchange rates, materials costs and labor agreements, can all have a dramatic impact on the outcome."
While many companies may decide to move manufacturing operations to capture cost advantages in the long run, there can be impediments to nearshoring including labor shortages in the U.S. and the huge cost of moving operations. AlixPartners says it should be considered on a case-by-case business to determine the most cost-effective decision.

My Insurance Company Should Not Be In The Logistics Business
Nicholas Hamner on Thursday, April 18, 2013 4
You know those ads on TV where an insurance spokesperson – be it some retro-hairstyled upbeat lady or a talking lizard – promise you steep discounts on your auto insurance just for letting them monitor your driving habits? They make it sound so simple, easy, and not at all intrusive.
Lies. Deceitful, hurtful lies.
I say this because my insurer, who I won’t name by name but they have pretty good hands and their commercials are rife with actors from Major League and Oz, increased my monthly rates a while back by about $60/month. There are no tickets, criminal charges, or accidents on either my wife or my accounts that would justify the increase, but when we called they were oh-so-happy to drop the amount down to our old rate in exchange for us using some of those tracking dongles that plug into our cars’ OBD ports. While my “suspicion-indicating” eyebrow just about punched through the ceiling when they told me that, whatever; send them now and stop charging me money. “Besides,” the inner monologue went, “What harm could it do? We’re both good drivers in simple cars – there’s no way we will be penalized.”
I was wrong.
When the little candy-colored dongles arrived, the screenshots on their activation website explained that, while we would never be charged more money based on the devices’ findings, we could increase our savings by NOT doing any of the following:
• Driving in the “caution hours” of 7a to 7p
• Driving in the “danger hours” of 2a to 7a
• Driving at speeds above 80MPH
• Braking hard
While we couldn’t avoid the first one, we could pretty much avoid all the others because we can set cruise control and we neither one are teenagers in beat-up Civics doing our best racing maneuvers, flooring it at green lights and slamming on our brakes. Heck, even if we wanted to do that, the fact that we split our time between an old Hyundai and a 4-cylinder minivan pretty much meant we couldn’t.
I was wrong.
It took three days of wheeling around before the device began reporting my driving data. When I pulled up the analytics website, I admit, I was geeked (I did the same thing when I got one of those automatic toll-paying devices. I’m a nerd.). That excitement was short-lived. In just the first trip I took – a 20 mile highway commute to work – I had somehow racked up three episodes of hard braking. "Whatever, fine, I’ll be more careful," the inner monologue went. By the end of the week, I’d racked up 13 instances of hard braking, 11 instances of “extreme braking” which I didn’t even know existed, and 27 miles of over-80 driving. Pretty impressive for a car that was set to drive 75, and either I'm a terrible driver or something was up.
A deeper look into the specific instances shows that their definition of “hard” for braking and acceleration is pretty subjective. And by “pretty subjective” I mean “it means whatever they want it to mean, whenever they want to mean it”. My hard braking instance descriptions included “braking from 75 to 70”, “braking from 73 to 69”, and “braking from 18 to 10”... otherwise known as “tapping the brake pedal”, “tapping the pedal again”, and “slowing down to approach a toll”.
I asked a friend, formerly a car electronics installer and now a mechanical engineer who I knew had taken his own insurance dongle apart, how the dongles compare to the commercial truck monitors he used to install. The tracking kits rose to prominence in the last two decades as the technology became reliable and rising oil costs and cost cutting needs drove trucking companies to use them en masse. The commercial devices, he says (and a quick Google search reinforces), use GPS to monitor speed and driver performance. He said insurance dongles, to appease privacy concerns, don’t use GPS but rely on engine data for speed and measure braking with an accelerometer, like those used to adjust screen positioning on a smartphone. He then pulled out his iPhone 5 to illustrate how easy it is to trip up an accelerometer. It was easy.
In his summation, those that want accurate results will use GPS. Those that want jittery results they manipulate to their own ends will stick to unreliable accelerometers. Which is why insurance companies – or at least my insurance company – should never make logistics equipment.
I'd prefer it if they didn't make decisions on my driving habits either.

The future of supply chains could focus on resilience
Strategic Sourceror on Thursday, April 18, 2013 0
Very few large supply chains are ever completely risk free, but they are essential for companies to deliver products in a global market. The focus of supply chain management should be to become more resilient, according to Spend Matters. Adapting procurement strategies for emergency preparedness will allow businesses to handle unexpected circumstances.
Forbes suggests the term supply chain itself is outdated because it implies a slow, linear process without anything happening in another parallel line, and this is not how modern business operates. Manufacturers and suppliers work together with a higher degree of collaboration, which can eliminate entire links from the chain. The word network may be a more accurate way to describe how supply chains are now managed. Supply chains used to function slowly, and companies could get away with waiting until there was a disruption before fixing it and minimizing damage. Now businesses rely on real-time information to prevent disruptions before they start.
However, it's difficult to prevent unpredictable occurrences, and North American supply chain managers are particularly concerned with risk analysis in strategic sourcing. According to a World Economic Forum report, top risk concerns in 2012 were natural disasters, extreme weather, political unrest, terrorism and sudden demand changes. Global managers appeared to be much more concerned with events outside of their control than changes to government regulations, such as import and export regulations.
Increasing supply chain resilience to lessen the impacts of natural or unnatural disasters on logistics, and Spend Matters suggests this is a matter of consistent monitoring and managing instead of optimizing the design of the supply network. Forbes says supply chain managers need to be able to see past the next steps in the process to get a better sense of what is actually happening. Supply chain visibility is critical for minimizing risk and and adapting to unexpected events.

MRO
3 Ways To Reduce MRO Spend
Dejana Dosen on Friday, September 28, 2018 0
MRO, or Maintenance Repair & Operations is known as the materials and services used in production to maintain, repair or operate the facility, machinery or equipment. These items typically include industrial supplies, safety supplies, janitorial products, power transmission products…etc. These items are typically low in spend, however the category as a whole can generate significant spend and greatly impact profitability if not managed correctly. For this reason, it is important for organizations to evaluate their MRO purchases and gain visibility into their purchasing behaviors.
The most effective way to quickly gain visibility into MRO purchasing is to gain visibility into the overall MRO spend. This can be done through a supplier usage report, or directly through a 12 month invoicing report that outlines critical information such as the product information, annual quantity, unit price, and unit of measure. Once this information is gathered from each vendor, the information should be consolidated into a single standardized excel file. The next step would be to categorize the items within this file and run an analysis to determine which vendors are being utilized for which category purchases, and how much the organization is spending with each vendor. After this information has been obtained, the following three strategy opportunities should be assessed to help reduce cost and increase overall profitability.
Supplier Consolidation
An industry best practice when managing MRO is consolidating purchases into as few vendors as possible. Supplier consolidation is a proven strategy to concentrate buying power and reduce purchase prices. Suppliers will be more willing to reduce product pricing when being granted a larger amount of spend, which in result can lead to substantial cost savings. Additional benefits of consolidating suppliers is overall efficiency of fewer transactions being processed, and the ability to improve supplier management while developing longer term supplier relationships.
Order Optimization
Analyzing volume usage over a period of time can bring insight into the average number of orders for a given product in a given year, as well as any peak times during the year. Using this information to bundle product purchases into a few orders will result in maximum profits by reducing delivery cost and overall product cost through a larger order quantity.
Contract Negotiations
In many instances, organizations purchase materials from a specific supplier, but do not have a contract or pricing agreement in place to manage the price of the products being purchased. Implementing long-term contracts with preferred suppliers gives an organization leverage to lock in pricing for a specific period of time, and the ability to implement category discounts on current MRO category purchases,. Suppliers will be willing to add additional incentives and category discounts knowing that purchases will continue for a specific period of time.
MRO spend can quickly add up and greatly impact the bottom line when left unmanaged. It is important for organizations to understand their purchasing behavior within this category to reduce overspending and utilizing best practices to effectively manage MRO. When managed properly, MRO can generate large savings and increase overall profitability within an organization.

Procurious Big Ideas Summit Lives Up to Its Name
Strategic Sourceror on Friday, September 28, 2018 0
Yesterday's Procurious Big Ideas Summit delivered on its promise to bring together Procurement's top minds and build discussions around its most prevailing issues. Topics ranged from the function's role in promoting social responsibility, the looming threat and promise of automation, and the ever-intense battle for world-class Procurement talent.
Members of Source One's team were among the 50 thought leaders in attendance. Here are a few of the big ideas they absorbed.
"Knowing yourself in the beginning of all wisdom."
Procurious Founder Tania Seary opened the day's proceedings with this quote from Aristotle. It suggests that self-reflection and self-awareness provide the foundation for every other kind of learning. If we take Aristotle's words at face value, it seems that few of today's Procurement groups qualify as particularly wise.
Back in March, Deloitte's CPO Report found that a staggering 65% of organizations lack visibility past their tier 1 suppliers. In a sense, this means they lack a fundamental understanding of themselves and their operations. Without this first level of understanding, these organizations cannot hope to act wisely across their supply chains. Imagine attempting to undergo a Procurement Transformation without developing an understanding of Procurement's current state, or kicking off a sourcing initiative without analyzing spend in the relevant categories. Both efforts are tantamount to seeking wisdom without first obtaining self-knowledge.
"Sustainable practices aren't just good for the planet and its people, they're good for business."
Dell Computer's Oliver Campbell delivered this statement shortly after polling the room. He asked the crowd in attendance how many of them believed that sustainability initiatives would ultimately cost their organization money. In a testament to the crowd's forward-thinking attitude, only a small portion raised their hands. Campbell's exercise might not have been as dramatic as he'd hoped, but the presentation that followed certainly packed a punch.
In a stirring call to action, Campbell outlined Dell's approach to responsible sourcing and urged Procurement to take a leading role in promoting sustainable practices. Dell's efforts to reclaim ocean plastic and repurpose diesel emissions provide a case study in the power of Green Procurement. In addition to serving the planet, Dell has proven time and again that more sustainable practices can also serve the bottom line.
"Focus on big changes to big things."
In keeping with the day's focus on big ideas, SAP Ariba's Pat McCarthy encouraged attendees to focus on risk, impact, and size when setting their priorities and taking strategic action. Most Procurement professionals, he suggested, got into the business because they enjoy fixing problems. Today they're in luck, because the opportunities in front of Procurement are bigger than ever before.
Like Campbell, McCarthy expressed his belief that a well-appointed Procurement function has the power to change the world. With the right level of visibility, Procurement ensure that Corporate Social Responsibility is more than a buzzword by working to solve issues like modern slavery, climate change, and corporate corruption.
"Welcome input from amateurs."
The Conversational Century's Elizabeth Linder opened her presentation by discussing one Moldovan politicians attitude toward social media. While social networks don't have a great reputation in American politics, Linder remarked that this particular leader adores Facebook. Providing for open communication with her constituents, the website is a great source for feedback. Linder suggested that businesses and politicians alike can afford to adopt the same mindset.
In Linder's mind, sites like Twitter and Facebook are so valuable because they give a platform to amateurs. While expertise will always be crucial, Linder believes that an outsider's perspective is often the most constructive. She encouraged the Procurement leaders in attendance to leverage the various social channels at their disposal to gather amateur insights. Though they'll certainly run into trolls, Linder is confident they'll also get a look at new and interesting perspectives.

Things to Consider When Procuring Analytics Technology
James Patounas on Friday, September 28, 2018 0
There are two ways of consuming reports for decision making. The first is that of performing a quick high level assessment to answer a well-posed question. These tend to be static reports that are automated on a recurring basis. An example is a weekly resource utilization report which answers a question around how well resources are being used over some time horizon. The second use case is an insights driven analysis where the objective is for the end-user to interact with the report in an interactive capacity and in doing so identify insights or generate new questions that should be answered. A reasonable way to think of this second use case is that of R&D where the underlying asset is data. However, in order to generate these reports there are an awful lot of complexities that must be implemented and managed against. Let us first consider the typical data pipeline.
Data Pipeline
A typical pipeline involves the following steps:
Integration
Preparation, Curation, & Enrichment
Exploration & Refinement
Analysis
Visualization
Every analytics implementation has a data pipeline. In some cases this may be reasonably simple. In other cases this may be extremely complex. The one certainty is that there will be data flowing in and out. What needs to happen in between these two steps will significantly differ depending on the complexities intrinsic in your data, the manipulations that must occur within your process, and the availability of people, process, and technology to execute.
Data Considerations
The primary considerations for procuring analytics tools are the same as those for any procurement initiative: people, process, technology, and value. At a more technical level, it's important to account for what are known as the V's of data.
Volume
How much data is being processed?
If it's small (i.e., ~ <600,000 rows) then Excel may meet your needs. If it's medium (i.e., can be held in computer memory) then a more technical solution like Python or R may be appropriate. If it's large (i.e., can't be held in computer memory) then perhaps a combination of a database and chunking with Python and R may be appropriate. If it's really large maybe you need to consider Hadoop and MapReduce.
Many modern technologies distribute parallel data access and computations over lower cost solution rather than continue to optimize vertically. Further efforts have begun on optimizing against the hardware itself such as SSD. Keep in mind, if you have a small dataset then processing in parallel may actually slow down your analytics pipeline due to the overhead of introducing a slave/master relationship that must be managed. Furthermore, this assumes that the underlying software you are using even addresses parallelization in the first place.
The volume will have significant implications in your process due to limitations from write speeds and read speeds. Specific attention should be paid to the tasks that you will be performing most frequently as not all technologies are made equal.
Variety
What types of data sources are being processed?
Data comes in many different formats. The three classes of data are structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Some example consumables include images, video, audio, numeric, spatial, and text. Many deliverables are actually a combination of multiple consumables. Consider for example a video. It may include visuals, audio, and text overplayed on top of each other. As such it's very important to consider the types of data you will be handling and your organization's requirements for ingesting, manipulating, analyzing, and presenting it. For instance, an organization handling Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data will likely have very different primary considerations than a financial institution.
Velocity
How frequently is the data received? How frequently is it consumed?
Data comes in two types that play a significant role in determining their velocity: streaming or non-streaming. Theoretically a streaming data source can be thought of as infinite data processes in small temporal chunks.
Velocity considerations may impact both our confidence in the accuracy of the data, how powerful (and so costly) our technology needs to be, and how complex our analytics use cases can be built. For instance, if we need to instantly process data because we receive it at a high frequency (i.e., stock market data) then it might not be viable to have bi-directional machine communication that properly validates the correctness of the packets being exchanged. Alternatively, if we need to make quick decisions with the data (i.e., a credit card company validating fraud with its models) we may need to have disparate analytic processes (i.e., an immediate feedback mechanism based upon a standard model and a small time horizon that's likely done in memory and a separate system that allows us to build, backtest, and tune a model from the a larger pool of data).
Veracity
What is the quality of the data being processed?
The quality of the data and the steps that one needs to apply in order to make it useful are an important technology and resource consideration. It is often estimated that 70-80% of a data resources time is spent cleaning data. There is definitely truth behind this assertion.
Valence
To what degree is the data interconnected?
Data that has a clear primary key / foreign key relationship or columns with a standard recurrent structure is wonderful because then you can easily connect it through joins, vlookups, appends, concatenation, or whatever flavor of connectivity functions you may be familiar with. However, most data is not this easily connected and requires some level of processing and/or entity resolution. Real value and insight typically doesn't come from structured data. Rather, it often comes from taking unstructured data and layering it on top of the structured data.
Further Considerations
Now that we've properly considered the data that we are handling and what we need to do with it in order to generate insights and visualizations we must also consider the appropriate organizational philosophy.
Disruption
Do we need backups of our data? Where and how often?
As much as we want everything to work all of the time, this is not a practical expectation. There will be disruptions to your process and technology. The real question is when and to what extent. It is extraordinarily important to consider how, where, and with what technology the data and associated processes should be developed, version controlled, backed up, and audited. Furthermore, what are the down-time versus up-time requirements? What is the plan in the unlikely scenario of a catastrophic event? Most importantly, it's important to consider how issues will be managed and communicated back to the developers, IT, and end-users, among others.
Ethics
What can we ethically do with the data, what must we divulge about it, and are our results potentially biased in some way?
This is a consideration that could potentially have huge PR impact. Ethics have now become a mainstream consideration given the problems that have surfaced in the media around Facebook, Microsoft, and other major tech companies. Let us assume that you have a machine learning model. Can you reasonably assume that your data science made it without any preconceived notions? This is not likely the case if they all come from similar academic or cultural backgrounds. Let us assume that there are no preconceived notions. Can you assume that the data itself is not the product of an underlying societal or cultural norm that is suboptimal and being reinforced by the model itself?
Security
How long should we keep the data? Who should be able to access it? What are the security requirements around it?
Most IT teams would agree that it is very important to know what level of restrictions and security protocol exists around your data. Does the data get transferred server-to-server? Then there should definitely be some form of encryption and decryption protocol in place. What considerations have gone into administrative rights? Who may actually access the data at any given point? Should they be able to access it? These are important considerations that must be managed and continually updated. Ideally from a secure, central location that offers easily deployed updated through some level of automation.
Of course, these days security is not limited to administrative and IT rights. There is also a data risk component associated with security. What is the shelf life of the data and how long should it be kept? The more data that might require a user agreement or NDA that your company has the more it might risk your company might be at if it's acquired by the wrong people. While unfortunate, it's imperative for every organization to consider the risk/reward surrounding its data, the shelf-life of that data, and the importance of insurance surrounding it.
Conclusion
The first step in the journey to analytics technology adoption is identification. From there it's all about executing against the above. Technology consideration, procurement, and adoption is a decision that should not be taken lightly. Many people think of an analytics solutions solely from the perspective of the operational efficiencies, visualization capabilities, and/or the insights to be gained from using them. While these are important considerations, they do not necessarily take into consideration the full picture. There are inherent complexities in selecting analytics solutions, such as a Business Intelligence (BI) tool, for your organization. As such, all of the relevant stakeholders including but not limited to IT, software engineering, analytics, operations, and legal should be involved in the decision making process.

P&G latest to rail against tariffs interrupting supply chain
The Strategic Sourceror on Friday, September 28, 2018 0
Small-business owners, trade organizations and multinational corporations haven't been shy about airing their opinions regarding the potential repercussions of the import tariffs installed by the White House, particularly as they pertain to supply chain management.
The latest to join the throngs of the none-too-pleased is Procter & Gamble.
As reported by CNN Money, the consumer goods giant issued a request to the Trump administration in early September, asking that it not be subject to the $200 billion tariff placed on a variety of imported products that P&G manufacturers. The company's requests fell on deaf ears, however, presaging challenging times may be ahead for the multinational corporation's distribution supply chain.
Selina Jackson, vice president of government relations and public policy at P&G, restated its opposition to the tariffs in a missive sent to the U.S. Trade Representative, which falls under the executive branch's purview.
"These imports are necessary to P&G's ability to delight consumers and meet their needs," Jackson explained, according to Fox Business. "Higher costs from tariffs may also translate into higher prices, reduce P&G sales and undermine American jobs in the P&G U.S. operations."
Unlike a growing number of manufacturers, which produce their products to save on operating expenses, 90 percent of the goods that P&G develops are made in the U.S.A., according to CNN Money. However, the parts, materials and equipment used to make these goods largely come from China, the same country that's engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war with the U.S.
Not only does buying these parts raise the cost of business for P&G, but it forces the company to charge more, creating a domino effect that could ultimately harm consumers and the U.S. economy at large.
"The West Virginia plant is expected to create around 1,800 jobs."
Tariffs will harm P&G workers, company says
In its original letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, Jackson warned that the tariffs would harm P&G workers. The multinational corporation is in the midst of developing a $500 million plant in West Virginia, one that's expected to create an estimated 1,800 jobs, according to CNN Money. But because much of its internal infrastructure derives from China, important tariffs will make it more expensive to finish off the plant's development.
"These new P&G jobs in West Virginia will be undermined by proposed tariffs," Jackson wrote in a Sept. 6 letter. "As the tariff impact ripples through P&G's manufacturing cost structure, P&G will be under intense pressure to increase the price of finished goods."
U.S Trade Council issues response
Although the initial comments were brushed off, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro has since responded, in an interview with Fox Business Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo.
"This argument about prices - there's very high cost to low prices," Navarro noted.
Navarro went on to state that P&G was being somewhat hypocritical by profiting off of goods coming from China instead of buying domestic, which led to companies shipping many of their manufacturing jobs overseas. Navarro said that the ongoing trade dispute is designed to put U.S. businesses in a better strategic position and ultimately lead to corporate cost reduction.
"If you look at this as an economist, what you see is the use of tariffs to pull down the unfair trade practices and tariffs in these foreign countries, but you also see it as a way to build capacity here," Navarro told Bartiromo. "Wages go up, jobs go up, factories get built, investment goes up and that's how you build a strong America."
Most of the tariff declarations have yet to be implemented, but since July, approximately $50 billion in new import and export tariffs have been enacted

Commercial developers hammered by skilled labor shortage
The Strategic Sourceror on Friday, September 28, 2018 0
The extraordinary growth of the economy is a classic good news/bad news situation for commercial builders and developers. The encouraging aspect is more people are back at work, as the unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent for half of the year, according to the most recent statistics from the Labor Department. This is partially due to business expansion, which requires more space and more workers to satisfy customer demand.
The bad news? Robust growth is exacerbating the poor shape of the skilled labor production supply chain, impacting a worker shortage that may have further to go before it gets better, based on newly released estimates.
The commercial construction sector is in dire need of more people to fill created as well as departed roles, and according to the USG Corporation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, this shortfall is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Indeed, the joint report revealed that the scarce amount of qualified builders in construction could worsen through to 2021.
"Commercial construction skilled labor shortages could be evident through to 2021."
Nearly 9 in 10 anticipate deleterious effects
Commercial contractors almost uniformly have felt - or expect to feel - the effects of the skilled labor deficit at least somewhat. Nearly 90 percent of respondents in the construction index analysis indicated as much, with 57 percent percent suspecting the fallout will be significant.
It isn't just the commercial sector that's hurting from a labor perspective. The same is true among residential real estate developers. The issue has become so apparent, it's reached 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where in July, the White House issued an executive order that will see to the training of as many as 50,000 new construction workers. This has the potential to make the recruitment and employment procurement process less intensive. Unsurprisingly, the National Association of Home Builders applauded the decision.
The only problem is training takes time, and developers need help right now.
Jennifer Scanlon, CEO and president of the USG Corporation, said recruitment efforts have been slow, although strides have been made. Construction businesses must ensure that they make the most of what help they have to ensure organizational adaptability.
"The commercial construction industry is growing, but the labor shortage remains unresolved," Scanlon conceded. "As contractors are forced to do more with less, a renewed emphasis on safety is imperative to the strength and health of the industry."
In other words, contractors can't afford to lose someone due to an injury because that will magnify the severity of the shortage situation for them.
63 percent working on advancing workplace safety culture
Contractors seem to recognize this predicament, which is why 63 percent of respondents in the USG/Chamber of Commerce poll said they were working on developing a more comprehensive safety culture for crews to live by while on the job. More than two-thirds - 67 percent - said they were going about this by developing training programs that engaged workers.
Aside from training, some suggest the best way to replenish the production supply chain is through automated intelligence. Smart technologies are being utilized in an ever increasing number of industries, although some fear that this trend may lead to job loss. Sixty-two percent of respondents in a recent Gallup poll said manufacturing and construction were the most likely sectors to have fewer employment openings if AI gains traction.
Industry experts say the best strategy for developers moving forward may be to use a combination of AI and skilled laborers, perhaps utilizing technologies for tasks that are more menial in nature.

What Makes a Spend Analysis Valuable
Brian Seipel, Future of Sourcing, 9/21/2018
When the subject of spend analysis comes up, business leaders often ask how they'll see a return on investment. While a hard dollar ROI is rarely obvious, Source One's spend analysis lead suggests that timely and effective initiative is inherently valuable. He cautions Procurement, however, from spending too much time on any analysis. Paralysis by analysis will not only cost the function time and money, but could lead it to miss out on opportunities for more high-value initiatives.

Michael Kors acquires Versace for $2.1 billion
The Strategic Sourceror on Thursday, September 27, 2018 0
In a bid to improve operational excellence on behalf of customers, as well as supply chain management, two of the more well-known names in the retail space are joining forces.
"The deal is worth a reported $2.1 billion."
As reported by numerous media outlets, Michaels Kors has agreed to buy luxury designer Versace, a move that could very well shake up an industry that's witnessed substantial turnover due to the impact of e-commerce. Worth a reported $2.1 billion, the deal will also purchase the luxury designer's debt, although Versace turned a corner in 2017 by finishing the year in the black, Reuters reported.
John Idol, CEO and chairman of Michael Kors Holdings, said in a statement that the merging of the two companies is mutually beneficial.
"With the acquisition of Versace we have created one of the world's leading fashion and luxury groups," Idol explained.
This isn't the first time Michael Kors Holdings has tried to purchase its former rival. Earlier this year, Idol met up with Donatella Versace, who took over the company when her brother, Gianni, passed away in 1997. Idol inquired as to whether she'd be willing to sell the business her brother founded.
"I wasn't thinking about selling," Versace told The Wall Street Journal. "But I talked to John. He has the same passion for the business. And he can offer us expertise."
Versace added that Idol's expertise in digital commerce helped to seal the deal, which is a core
component of how the luxury designer manages its production supply chain.
To be renamed Capri Holdings
When two companies combine into one, there's always a question of what the business will be called, which can take a while to determine. As soon as the deal closes, which is slated for some time in the fourth quarter, Michael Kors will change its name to Capri Holdings. The company said the name derives from the island of the same name which is situated in the Bay of Naples off the Sorrentine Peninsula, CNBC reported.
In a statement, Donatella said she couldn't be happier with Versace's new partnership.
"We are all very excited to join a group led by John Idol, whom I have always admired as a visionary as well as a strong and passionate leader," Donatella explained. "We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace's long-term success."
Poised to widen locations internationally
In addition to the potential impact the merge could play on the European luxury market, one that's highly sought-after given its exclusivity, the deal runs counter to what's been a theme among retailers of late, where brick-and-mortar locations have closed due to slow-moving sales. Versace intends to expand its locations, jumping from 200 stores worldwide to an anticipated 300, according to multiple reports. It also hopes to increase its supply of accessories and footwear, something Idol specializes in. If all goes according to plan, its revenues from accessories and footwear would increase to 60 percent of revenue from their current 35 percent.
However, the company's physical footprint likely won't be quite as widespread in North America, although it will remain where the majority of its operations are located. Specifically, Michael Kors plans to reduce its visibility in the Americas to 57 percent from 66 percent, while expanding in Europe and Asia, in particular - to 19 percent from 11 percent, CNBC reported.
Michael Kors' acquisition of Versace is only its latest strategic sourcing plan of action within the luxury retail segment. As reported by BBC, the business purchased luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2017 for $1.2 billion. Industry insiders say Michael Kors needs to be careful, however, to avoid the saturation effect.

Big Ideas Summit 2018: Assessing Supply Chain Risk
Carole Boyle on Thursday, September 27, 2018 0
When you consider the risks facing your organization’s supply chain, your mind probably races through series of headlines topping the news. Most recently: the US Trade War with China, impending natural disasters, Brexit; the list goes on. Leading companies have taken proactive action to mitigate supply chain disruption and ensure business continuity. However, as discussed during Procurious Big Ideas Summit, it’s not often those risks making the headlines that catch organizations off guard. Rather, the downstream consequences of those events or what Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline describes as systems of systems affects that can dismantle an enterprise if not prepared.
With Procurement teams at the forefront of supplier decisions and interactions, these teams are in a prime position to help enterprises remain resilient during times of uncertainty or even disaster. However, when polling the room and supply chain and procurement professionals during Big Ideas Summit Session in Chicago earlier today, less than half the room raised their hand in agreement that they collaborate with internal departments responsible for addressing risk within their enterprise.
His advice for companies looking to effectively address risk: taking an intelligence-led approach with a framework that not only addresses the risks that immediately come to mind, as well as those do not:
Understand that intelligence inherently isn’t a perfect process. Everything is a “best effort” – and you more or less get out what you put in.
Answer the “So what?” You’re going to be bombarded with a mountain of information, clear requirements will help you define what’s most important to your organization.
To generate the best possible approach, take a balanced approach to your people, processes, and technology.
Make an impact by considering the needs of your audience. How much information is enough vs. how much information is overkill?
Recognize that intelligence needs to be managed as a project, with rigor and due diligence
This is just one of the many insightful discussions had during this year’s Procurious Big Ideas Summit. Justin Crump of Sibylline joined an impressive line-up of keynote speakers including Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management, and Pat McCarthy, SVP, and GM of SAP Ariba. A unique event experience, attendees were able to attend in person in Chicago, as well as digitally through the live stream. For both types of participation levels, attendees walked away with insights into how leading companies are approach risk mitigation, sustainability, diversity, and more.

Is Blockchain the Future of Procurement or a Flash in the Pan?
Strategic Sourceror on Thursday, September 27, 2018 0
Procurement's digital revolution is well underway. According to Hackett's most recent CPO Agenda report, few organizations have any doubt it will continue. The report found that 95% of surveyed CPOs believe digital tools will fundamentally transform their supply chains within a matter of years.
A number of emerging technologies are expected to hasten this transformation. With respect to both hype and potential applications, however, one commands more attention than (perhaps) any other - blockchain. Recent years have made it clear that blockchain is useful for far more than keeping cryptocurrencies in check. The blockchain-powered IBM Food Trust, for example, helps retailers trace produce from shelf to farm in a matter of seconds. Such improvements to traceability promise to protect consumer safety and corporate reputations alike.
This week, Brian Seipel joins the Source One Podcast to examine what blockchain could mean for Procurement professionals.
Seipel begins the episode with a few disclaimers. In addition to reminding listeners that he's no "tech guru," he points out that blockchain's future is by no means certain. While it could come to represent "a monumental advancement" for supply chains everywhere, it could still just as easily fade into obscurity when the next big thing comes along.
He makes no attempt to predict which outcome is more likely. Rather, Seipel contrasts the much-discussed technology with the (often outdated) tools Procurement currently employs. Blockchain's tamper-proof ledgers, he suggests, will make it easy to diagnose issues across the supply chain and address them before they become costly.
He reminds listeners, however, that the technology is not fool-proof. "We live in an age," he says, "where our coworkers are still falling prey to phishing schemes." The worst a Procurement group can do is let blockchain's promise lull them into a false sense of security. Organizations who fail to train their teams effectively will find themselves falling into many of the same technological traps as always.
Despite the potential drawbacks, Seipel ends on a hopeful note. "The only limits to this technology," he concludes, "will be in how Procurement can envision using it."

Procurement Welcomes Halloween
Brian Seipel on Wednesday, September 26, 2018 0
Just wait - any moment now… The temperature will drop, leaves will start to change color, and America’s youth will have a collective sugar coma that lasts for no less than three dark and stormy nights.
It’s that time of year again – just as we’re getting ready to say ‘goodbye’ to September (and summer, and the beach), we’re gearing up for Halloween. That process includes buying bulk candy, costumes, and decorations.
As Procurement pros, I thought you might like to see a breakdown of just where this spend is going…
The Halloween (Pumpkin)Pie Chart
The National Retail Federation is predicting heavy spend this year for Halloween, reaching $9 Billion. Broken down among all the happy Halloween enthusiasts, they’re estimating an average total of about $87 per person. That’s a lot of candy corn!
And other items as well. The NRF is expecting a breakdown that resembles the chart below:
If this number seems eerily high to you, you may be right. Halloween is becoming one of the most expensive holidays. I wouldn’t expect the October fright fest to overtake Christmas any time soon – The average American spend about ten times as much on Christmas as they do on Halloween. At the same time, however, Halloween keeps getting more and more expensive as the years go by. NRF lists Halloween costs as far back as 2013 when Americans were expected to average about $75 per person. Although 2013 seemed like a somewhat lighter year, the average over the last half decade reached about $77 – still a big difference between this year and years prior.
Click here for a breakdown of annual costs from the NRF.
The Impact of Tariffs on Halloween
We can’t forget the other big news on the block besides Halloween. Tariffs are scaring plenty of American businesses that face steep increases in the price of goods they depend on to produce their products. While we’re all focused on heavy hitting product categories including early steel and aluminum tariffs, it can be chilling to think just how far-reaching the list could grow to be.
The Halloween Industry Association recently released a statement on the subject. In that statement, the organization clearly and explicitly opposed any tariffs that might hit Haloween costumes and other products imported from China.
Happy Halloween to you Procurement Pros!
I’m not normally one to recommend taking work home with you. However, do me a favor this year. When you’re out there prowling the streets with your costumed kids collecting candy – I hope you’ll join me in thinking about the immensity that is the American Halloween supply chain monster!

Walmart Embraces Blockchain-Enabled Food Tracking
Strategic Sourceror on Wednesday, September 26, 2018 0
This summer, an E. coli outbreak from tainted romaine lettuce killed five people, put nearly 100 in the hospital, and caused over 200 to fall ill. According to the Center for Disease Control, these numbers made this the deadliest E. coli outbreak on American soil in over two decades. Though the tainted greens were eventually traced to a single farming region, both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration struggled to identify how, when, and where the contamination actually occurred.
Responses from consumer groups were not kind. A late-May letter signed by nine organizations read, "Retailers using advanced technology, such as blockchain, now report they can identify the origin of certain produce shipments in as little as 2.2 seconds. Given these advances, it is no longer acceptable that the FDA has no means to swiftly determine where a bag of lettuce was grown or packaged."
Walmart announced this week its intention to join these tech-enabled retailers. In a letter to its leafy greens suppliers, the corporation unveiled the Walmart Food Traceability Initiative. Powered by blockchain technology, these measures are intended to "increase transparency in the food system and create shared value for the entire leafy green farm to table continuum."
The announcement represents a milestone in Walmart's ongoing partnership with the IBM Food Trust Network. Over the last eighteen months, Walmart has worked with IBM and select suppliers to develop and test a blockchain-enabled system for tracking its lettuce. The trials have proven it possible to trace an individual package from farm to Walmart store in a matter of seconds.
This week's letter makes it clear that Walmart considers such innovation long overdue. "Walmart believes," it says, "the current one-step up and one-step back model of food traceability is outdated for the 21st century." The retail giant goes on to insist that its suppliers join them in entering this new era.
By February of next year, Walmart expects each of its direct suppliers to leverage the IBM Food Trust Network to provide at least one-step back traceability. By October, they are required to work directly with their own suppliers to provide Walmart with full, end-to-end visibility. This might sound like a big ask, but Walmart also ensures its suppliers that joining the initiative requires little more than "a smart device and internet."
Walmart's initiative is just one example of an organization leveraging blockchain tools to improve traceability and promote consumer safety. The IBM Food Trust Network alone constitutes a massive, collaborative effort to put this evolving technology to socially responsible use. Its progress thus far suggests, at the very least, that blockchain is far more than an empty buzzword.
Still, not everyone is convinced. Sarah Taber, an independent food safety consultant, expressed her skepticism to Supply Chain Dive. "People get excited about blockchain," she remarks, "because it is fantastic for tracking digital assets, but for physical assets, it's just not." She suggests that disorganization and poor communication are generally to blame for poor traceability. A new technology, however revolutionary, cannot hope to remedy these. Speaking from years of experience, she presents "investing in people" as the only real answer to the food contamination issue. Taber's warnings provide a helpful reminder that investing in new tools at the expense of people is a short-sighted, potentially ruinous move.
Walmart concludes its letter by reminding suppliers that it is striving "to create a safer, smarter, and more sustainable food system so people can live better." To reach that goal, the ambitious retailer must take care not to let technology obscure its view of those people.

Supply chain still problematic for EpiPen carriers
The Strategic Sourceror on Wednesday, September 26, 2018 0
Supply chain optimization isn't just a matter of ensuring efficiency and expediency. It can be a matter of life and death when customers are unable to obtain pharmaceuticals and other products that contain ingredients people need to overcome health emergencies.
Such is the situation for pharmacies, many of which are experiencing severe shortages of EpiPens that individuals use to overcome extreme allergic reactions to certain substances.
"The FDA warned about the EpiPen shortage in May."
In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert that was widely reported by numerous news outlets regarding the relative unavailability of EpiPens. Sold by Mylan, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, EpiPens contain epinephrine, a naturally occurring hormone that when injected can counter the effects of anaphylaxis. When not treated swiftly, anaphylaxis can result in death due to the extreme symptoms that result from allergic reactions to foods like peanuts, wheat, soy and shellfish, among others.
Parents frustrated in preparing kids for school
Because there are several generic versions of the EpiPen, they're still available for purchase, but they can be hard to find in large quantities, an issue that's come to the fore now that schools are back in session.
Julie Cook, a mom of two teenagers with severe food allergies, told The Wall Street Journal that she's devoted a lot of time and effort to the search, but has come up empty, being told by her pharmacist that refills wouldn't be available for several weeks.
"It's so frustrating," Cook explained. "Why is this happening in August? What's going on? And what's going to happen in the future?"
In the spring, when the FDA first warned of the shortage - which Pfizer attributes to the effects of changing its manufacturing process to comply with federal regulations - the agency didn't expect the
EpiPen scarcity to last for long. But several months removed, the shortfall persists, an issue that California resident Tory Palenscar realized in August while preparing his 7-year-old daughter with food allergies for the school year.
"I started panicking," Palenscar told the Journal, alluding to when her pharmacy didn't have the lifesaving devices. She was able to find a pharmacy that still had EpiPens available farther away from her home but is eager to buy more.
Generics differ in administration
Complicating matters further is that the generic equivalents of EpiPens aren't necessarily used like the originals. The Food Allergy Research & Education made this reality apparent via social media messages in the aftermath of the FDA's May announcement and now devotes a portion of its website to helping consumers understand the differences.
The shortage isn't exclusive to the U.S. either. As reported by BBC News, its affecting the United Kingdom as well, also due to manufacturing complications that haven't been detailed with specificity. The Department of Health, which serves as the equivalent to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said developers are seeking to "resolve the supply situation as quickly as possible" and advised patients to "speak to their doctors about using an alternative adrenaline auto-injector device."
Meanwhile, back in the States, the FDA has been in close contact with manufacturers to ensure that the distribution supply chain avoids serious disruptions and improve supplier relationship management.

Infographic - The Automation and Specialization of Jobs in America
Strategic Sourceror on Wednesday, September 26, 2018 0
The following blog comes to us from Dennis Speath of Cutting Tools Engineering.
It’s no secret that America’s manufacturing industry is on the rise in more ways than one. Even though automation, offshoring, and other trends have caused about five million job losses throughout the past 10 years, the industry is quickly making a comeback. In fact, America’s manufacturing industry is currently producing about 12% of the country’s gross domestic product.
Manufacturing industry trends are continuing to evolve, though; many specialized jobs in the field require more technical training as well as a college degree. This is mainly a result of the many technological advancements the industry has seen. And by 2027, it’s estimated that the industry will add up to 3.5 million jobs to its workforce. These jobs require more in-depth experience with technical and advanced machinery, but they open countless doors to what’s possible within the realm of high-tech manufacturing. It’s even prompted companies to reshore operations to maintain the advancements in productivity and technology.
As a result of these spectacular innovations within the American manufacturing industry, workers are earning more income from their jobs. In fact, some of the most specialized jobs within this industry sector pay up to $26 an hour.
This advancement in technology will have a ripple effect on America’s entire social economy, paving the way for increased educational opportunities and underlying growth. This was far from the case half a century ago, when the majority of workers within the manufacturing industry had little or no college education. Currently, nearly 72% of the workers within the industry have a two year college degree, which brings the total percentage of workers with any type of higher education to 32%.
Ultimately, the ‘reshoring movement’ that’s rapidly occurring within America’s manufacturing industry has countless benefits on companies as well as individuals within society. Now, virtually anyone can improve their quality of life through the growing opportunities available in the high-tech and high-paying manufacturing workforce.
Dennis Spaeth, who served as electronic media editor at Cutting Tool Engineering, from January 2007 through May 2018, is now Publisher and Chief Executive Officer of the magazine and CTE Publications Inc.

Five Procurement Mistakes that are Costing You Money
Brian Seipel on Tuesday, September 25, 2018 0
A good juggler can keep three balls in the air at once. A great juggler can maybe keep seven or eight circling above them. All things considered, however, each of these two jugglers only has a single ball in hand at once.
With all the day-to-day tactical tasks on Procurement’s plate these days, just trying to keep the trains running can seem a lot like juggling. There are only so many tasks we can focus on each day. At some point, with so much going on, we’re bound to make at least one mistake.
Mistakes happen. Even the best Procurement team will drop a ball now and then. However, even seemingly small mistakes can have huge consequences.
While not exhaustive, I’ve listed several big mistakes that are becoming all too common these days.
Not checking the market. I’ll start with the most obvious mistake first. There are always long-term suppliers that we’ve worked with for years. They know our business and we trust them to support us. Perhaps we’ve conducted a few rounds of negotiations over the years and, to their credit, they conceded some marginal price reductions. Is this a win? Hard to say – if you haven’t gone to market in the past couple years, you have no idea what competitors are charging. Beyond costs alone, you don’t know what advancements hungry competitors are devising that could revolutionize your own processes.
You don’t know what you don’t know. Identify the key players in the market today, and gather intel through an RFI or RFP – see what you’re missing out on. Minimally, your incumbent will likely come to the negotiating table with a much stronger discount next time.
Discounting Suppliers’ Value. I want to return to one point I glossed over above. To be sure cost reduction is important, but getting a lower price isn’t the only value suppliers bring. Suppliers know their markets better than Procurement can – they have the benefit of deep focus, where we need to be familiar with a great breadth of offerings procured. Too often, however, Procurement ignores valuable insights from these experts. Reach out to your suppliers at a more strategic level – find out where they see the industry moving, and what advancements they’re making that could benefit you.
Failing to communicate with suppliers. As mentioned, running an RFI or RFP is a great way to learn more about a supplier’s offerings and how they can solve your problems. However, communication needs to be a two-way street. You can’t simply outline a short list of specs and expect a supplier to respond with the perfect plan. Suppliers will have questions. They’ll have a need for clarification. Too often, an open forum for Q&A is omitted from the RFP time line.
Make no mistake, blocking off this communication will hurt you. If suppliers don’t get the information they need, they’re left to make assumptions about your needs. The more assumptions that get baked into a proposal, the more likely they won’t be a fit for your needs. Additionally, comparing two proposals filled with assumptions is essentially comparing apples to oranges.
Failing to negotiate. By the end of our market event, if we played our cards right, we should have strong market intelligence on competitive pricing and SLAs. If the lowest cost supplier also offers competitive service, that’s a win, right? Yes – but not as much of a win as it could be. Identifying a competitive initial cost does not replace the need to further negotiate. Everythign is on the table until you sign on the dotted line.
Failing to enforce policy. So we’ve set up a competitive agreement with a new supplier that should save us huge sums of money. Great! Or is it? That all depends on if that agreement is adhered to. Office supply spend is a simple example, and a very common place for this mistake to occur. You’ve worked to put together a competitively priced contract list of common items. However, employees continue to order off-contract, thereby sidestepping all the work you’ve done in order to buy supplies that are more expensive than the items you negotiated.

We’re rounding out the bottom of the third quarter of 2018 and, when you consider the upcoming holiday season, not too far away from 2019. Many of you may already have your eyes on developing trends as we approach the New Year and may be wondering, “What’s 2019 going to bring for Procurement trends?”
Another year has gone by without me getting my hands on a crystal ball. That said, I’d wager a few concepts will be on everyone’s mind. You’ll find my predictions below in no certain order. While all may be big topics moving forward, they aren't necessarily concepts that Procurement pros have made their minds up about yet. In my mind, 2019 won't be about whether these trends continue, but how Procurement reacts to them.

MRO Spend Analysis: You Don't Know What You Don't Know
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, September 25, 2018 0
Why do so many companies fail to optimize their MRO spend profile, even after committing to making a change?
In many cases, it's because they neglect to conduct a thorough and effective spend analysis. The process of diving into historical spend provides the foundation for a more effective, strategic approach moving forward. Done correctly, spend analyses make it possible for Procurement to achieve an overview of their historical purchases within a category and identify opportunities for both short and long-term cost reduction. In a high-volume category like MRO, however, the process often looks too daunting for Procurement to even attempt.
In Part II of Source One's new whitepaper on MRO spend management, the Strategic Sourcing experts take a closer look at the value of a good spend analysis. They offer best practices backed up by their collective decades of supply chain experience and aim to alleviate any misgivings Procurement might have about this complicated category.
Check out MRO Demystified Part II: The Value of a Spend Analysis to learn more about:
Rethinking historical approaches to analyzing and managing MRO spend.
Developing the right goals for spend analyses and sourcing initiatives.
Selecting the right taxonomy for an MRO spend analysis.
Collecting and categorizing spend data in the most efficient way possible.
Leveraging MRO spend data to identify opportunities for cost reduction.
Encouraging suppliers and stakeholders to develop more effective data collection processes.
And more . . .
Make no mistake, wading through years of MRO spend data is a time-consuming process. This is doubly true for organizations who've historically relied on their suppliers to collect and store data. That's no reason to abandon hope. With the insights offered by Source One, organizations should find that even the (admittedly) hard work of constructing an MRO market basket is simpler.

Make the Right Procurement Technology Decisions
Strategic Sourceror on Tuesday, September 25, 2018 0
Like all business units, Procurement stands at the brink of a new technological era.
You don't need to be an expert in Supply Chain Management to understand this. A quick glance at any industry blog should provide a sense of how loud and how pervasive the hype machine has become.
It's not hard to see why. Long dismissed as a tactical, low-value entity, Procurement is eager to land on the next big thing. This enthusiasm, however, has its downside. In their efforts to embrace new tools and reach the cutting edge, Procurement groups often rush into things. As a result, many find themselves struggling to implement tools that are mismatched to their actual needs and capabilities.
To make matters more complicated, most solution providers are moving away from the consultative space to focus on developing their core competencies. Oftentimes, this means Procurement is left to assess, select, and implement technologies on its own. Even the most well-appointed team can feel overwhelmed when this is the case.
That's why Source One introduced it's suite of Procurement Technology Advisory services. Leveraging their collective decades of supply chain experience, the spend management experts offer end-to-end support to help organizations develop an optimal approach to their tools and solutions.

Tackling Trump’s Tariffs
Jaisheela Setty on Tuesday, September 25, 2018
It’s a hard pill to swallow, but Trump’s tariffs are here to stay (at least for now). China has been the Mecca for raw materials, labor, electronics, etc. at incomparable prices. However, that might all be changing. President Trump hit China with tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods earlier this month on top of the $50 billion worth already taxed earlier this year. Goods on the list include: steel, aluminum, solar panels, circuit boards, vinyl, automotive parts, food processing machinery, lasers, medical equipment, plywood, and much more. If that wasn’t enough to rattle financial markets,
Trump stated that he was prepared to “immediately” place tariffs on another $267 billion worth of imports if China retaliated again.
What does this mean? It means roughly half of all Chinese imports into the US will soon face levies. High profile companies Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to name a few are investing considerable resources lobbying against the tariffs. Recently, retail giant Wal-Mart has warned the US Trade Representative that they will have to raise their prices for house items ranging from cribs to Christmas lights due to tariffs. Unfortunately, the trade war will not only affect corporations but also affect the everyday consumer. The tariffs are said to raise prices on food, electronics, tools, furniture, and much more.
For readers not keeping up with political news (don’t worry, you’re very much not alone) and wondering why Trump is tariff happy, here's the gist. The tariffs are intended to pressurize China to change their trade practices that Trump states are hurting American businesses. Trump asserts that the US can no longer tolerate the trade gap between what is exported to China and what is imported back in. America’s economic strength along with China’s economic slowdown was an advantageous environment for Trump to strike. The only way for China to gain relief would be to reach an agreement with the administration’s trade demands, which include allowing American companies have greater access to the China market. Economists and trade analysts widespread are stating that Trump’s actions are unfavorable for U.S. growth. The National Association for Business Economics survey showed 91% of respondents stated the tariffs will have “unfavorable consequential impacts” on the U.S. economy. Furthermore, let’s not forget that China isn’t the only one being taxed. Trump’s administration have also imposed tariffs on other countries such as Canada, European Union, Australia, Mexico, India, and Argentina.
This trade war has intensified pressure on companies, specifically, Procurement organizations to reevaluate their strategies in order to mitigate the current landscape.
Three approaches Procurement organizations can take include: 1) find alternatives sources/suppliers; 2) optimize their supply chains; 3) identify cost savings opportunities in other areas of the business in order to remain cost effective, competitive, and retain their customer base.
Option 1 would include extensive market research into the category(s) affected by the tariffs in order to find new sources. Once you do, you will want to strategically negotiate a new agreement(s) to ensure continuity of supply while reducing transitioning costs. Option 2 would require a full investigation of your organization’s supply chain and thoroughly understanding the logistics and handling of your goods to identify efficient work arounds to alleviate added costs. Option 3 would require a collaboration across the enterprise to review the organization holistically and engineer a savings pipeline in order to offset costs. If you have exhausted all three options or if the three options don’t make sense for your organization, you will have to strategize an effective way to communicate with your customers and allow them to fully understand the reason for the downstream impacts and possibly incentivize in order to hold their business.
Though President Trump continues to tweet upbeat about his actions and progress, only time will tell the future of the economy. We will have to continue to keep a close watch and remain agile in order to sustain this ever changing landscape of the global economy.

Regardless of your political position, the Trump Administration's new approach to trade puts a great deal of American businesses in an interesting spot. Years ago, changes in the global market made it, for some, an almost unconscious decision to begin purchasing from China. Now, due to drastically different tariffs, American suppliers have seemingly regained their edge on their overseas competition. The change in steel prices has been heavily covered by the media, but there a number of other tariffs that may also effect the way your company spends.

Due to low production capacity and high demand stateside, Dominick thinks the answer may be yes.

Procurement Transformation
The Procurement Maturity Model: Where is Your Organization?
Strategic Sourceror on Friday, September 21, 2018 0
Procurement professionals everywhere have one word on their minds, Transformation. Tools are evolving, a new crop of professionals is entering the workforce, and the Procurement function is finally starting to secure some of the executive buy-in it rightly deserves. It's an exciting time and Procurement is understandably eager to evolve and enter a new, more strategic era.
But what does a Procurement Transformation actually look like? Is it a realistic goal for every organization?
The answer is complicated. Procurement Transformation isn't a term with single, static definition. It means something different to each and every organization. That particular definition will depend on Procurement's current state, its standing within the organization, and its goals for future strategic growth. For some companies, Transformation might be as simple as recognizing Procurement's strategic potential and beginning to invest in its growth. For others, the process will see Procurement bolster its strategic credentials and accept a spot at the executive table.
Whatever the process looks like, getting it started is often an initiative unto itself. Without a true sense of how and why Procurement should go about transforming, many organizations find themselves quickly admitting defeat. In all likelihood, these organizations skipped an essential step in the Procurement Transformation process. They've neglected to conduct a Procurement Maturity Assessment.
In theory, every organization wants to achieve best-in-class status. This lofty goal, however, is rarely a realistic one for your average Procurement team. A Maturity Assessment enables Procurement to reach a genuine understanding of its current capacity and capabilities. The exercise makes it possible for Procurement to set more realistic goals for itself and strategically target areas for improvement.
Where does your Procurement function land?
Laggard (Tactical)
Laggard Procurement teams are stuck in the function's tactical past. There's little if anything strategic about these small, obscure groups. In fact, these folks are the sort that have earned Procurement its less-than-stellar reputation. At best, they're perceived as a necessary evil within their organizations. Cutting costs and making purchases on a reactive, as-needed basis, they're helping keep the lights on. And that's about the nicest thing you can say for them. At worst, these groups are the cause of organizational friction. That's not entirely their fault. Organizations who've never watched a more strategic Procurement function at work can't reasonably be expected to invest in building one.
Traditional (Operational)
These Procurement teams aren't doing much better. For a traditional Procurement function, the three-bid-and-buy process is about as strategic as the sourcing process ever gets. Purchases are still made on a largely reactive basis with little thought to anything other than hard dollar cost. Though they occupy a slightly more prominent role than laggard departments, traditional Procurement units are still mostly mired in tactical processes. Managing inventory, processing purchase orders, and renewing contracts constitute the bulk of their daily workload. Though more and more organizations are working to build strategic Procurement teams, the majority still find themselves in this spot.
Augmented (Strategic)
Here's where Procurement starts to distinguish itself as a value-adding function. Enjoying a good level of executive support and buy-in, these teams employ a strategic sourcing process that takes into account far more than price alone. Though an augmented Procurement team isn't necessarily a leader within the business, it's earned internal respect by optimizing supplier relationships, providing for greater spend visibility, and (crucially) gathering metrics to report on its success. An augmented Procurement team looks for opportunities to boost its performance with the help of training programs, new technologies, and collaboration with representatives from other business units. If your Procurement team can count itself among this class, it's well on its way to becoming truly exemplary.
World-Class (Innovative)
These are the rare Procurement groups that occupy a fully-strategic, highly-valued role within their organization. They have the ear of the C-suite and are trusted to drive organization-wide strategic initiatives. Thanks to a strong, consistent brand identity they have no trouble attracting and retaining world-class talent. This talent enables them to make change not merely a goal, but a cultural imperative for everyone across the business. A culture of continuous improvement enables them to stay on the cutting edge of emerging technologies and consistently refine their own internal processes.

TACME Comments on MACRA
On April 27, 2016, CMS released its proposed regulation to implement the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). The proposed rule creates a "Quality Payment Program" to replace old reporting programs. There two tracks, the first called the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and a second track involves alternative payment models (APM). MIPS is based on a 100-point score, with clinical practice improvement activities (CPIA) representing 15 percent of the score. This is an area where CME can play an important role in helping CMS achieve its quality measure objectives. The proposed rule leaves great discretion to the Secretary of HHS to define what will be included in these activities. As stated in the rule's preamble: "Clinical Practice Improvement Activity (CPIA) means an activity that relevant eligible clinician organizations and other relevant stakeholders identify as improving clinical practice or care delivery and that the Secretary determines, when effectively executed, is likely to result in improved outcomes."
According to the statute, any CPIA measure must be "relevant to an existing CPIA subcategory (or a proposed new subcategory)" as defined in the law. Unfortunately, those subcategories do not currently include a specific reference to medical education. However, the language defining CPIA, when coupled with the authority granted to the Secretary of HHS as proposed, offers a real opportunity for advocates of CME to argue that CME should be included in the measurement category. In short, CME should be a means by which doctors get credit under MIPS because it improves beneficiary outcomes, leads to practice improvement, can be performed by providers of all types, is feasible to implement, can be validated by CMS, and is evidence-based!
A Call for Comments was requested and below is TACME’s submission on behalf of TACME members and those in our profession from the state of Texas. For more information please visit http://www.cmecoalition.org/macra.html.

Why India refuses to sign on to US plans for overseas regime change
If you think this is about one Indian government showing some spine, you’re wrong

The India-US embrace today is much tighter than it was in 2001, in the chaotic days after the September 11 terror attacks. Yet, a sense of déjà vu is hard to avoid these days from the Indian perspective as the United States of America tries to secure, country-by-country, international support for regime change in Venezuela.
There’s, of course, the obvious parallel. Back then, President George W. Bush had infamously said of his soon-to-be-launched war in Afghanistan: “Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” Eighteen years later, the speaker is the current US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the context Venezuela and its embattled president, Nicolás Maduro. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side,” Pompeo told the United Nations security council in January. “Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem.” On February 12, the national security adviser, John Bolton, issued an even more direct threat, commenting on Twitter on an article on India’s oil purchase from Venezuela: “Nations and firms that support Maduro’s theft of Venezuelan resources will not be forgotten.”
What’s less openly acknowledged is why — despite a nuclear deal, a strategic partnership, a common rival in China and multi-billion dollar defence purchases since 2001 — India still refuses to sign onto America’s plans for overseas regime change. The answer isn’t principles, though that’s what the ministry of external affairs will tell you. It isn’t innate love for the current regimes in Venezuela, Iran and elsewhere that the US wants to topple. When it boils down to the reason, it isn’t even realpolitik. Ultimately, the answer is America’s track record, and the distrust that it still evokes in India’s strategic community.
“We are of the view that it is for the people of Venezuela to find [a] political solution to resolve their differences through constructive dialogue and discussion without resorting to violence,” the external affairs ministry spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar, has said, outlining the Indian government’s position. It might appear boilerplate, but in New Delhi and in Washington, American diplomats have interpreted the statement for what it is: a clear assertion that India will not back external intervention in the oil-rich country.
Strip away the diplomatese, and the unstated worry is: what’s to stop the US from some day attempting a regime change in India too, if it is really unhappy with the state of bilateral relations? The US claims of support for human rights in countries where it seeks regime change has few takers in the developing world where memories of colonialism and the subsequent selective overthrow of governments — often democratically elected — are fresh.
That was Indira Gandhi’s worry in the 1970s. Despite public statements to the contrary — Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the US Congress in 2016 that the two countries had left behind the “hesitations of history” — mistrust lingers. Occasionally, it filters through into the open too. At the height of the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement against the United Progressive Alliance government in 2011, the Congress questioned if foreign powers, such as the US, were funding the campaign. The US denied the allegation, and there’s no evidence to back the Congress claim.
Make no mistake, blaming the US or other external actors is also a tactic that governments — in India and elsewhere — have frequently used to discredit popular movements against them. But there’s no escaping that there’s also genuine suspicion at play. That’s why it’s no surprise that Venezuela isn’t the only country where India remains unwilling to support regime change.
Yesterday, India supported Iran in celebrating ‘Chabahar Day’, hosting investors and governments from the region at the strategic port in the Gulf of Oman, which New Delhi is developing. Even as the Donald Trump administration continues to ratchet up tensions with Iran, India is signalling that it intends to publicly do business with the Islamic republic. Indian officials say New Delhi also intends to seek a continuation of the special waiver that allows the purchase of oil from Iran without attracting sanctions against Indian companies from the US.
If you think this is about one Indian government showing some spine, you’re wrong. The previous UPA government took similar positions ahead of the invasion of Libya in 2011 and over the ouster of the Viktor Yanukovych regime in Ukraine in 2014. The BJP-led government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, too, managed to steer clear of the Iraq War despite pressure from some sections within the party to send troops there.
Are India’s strategic establishment and political class being paranoid? It’s hard to say. But the US certainly hasn’t helped its case. Dov Levin, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, counted 81 instances of “partisan electoral interventions” abroad by the US between 1946 and 2000 in a September 2016 paper published in the Conflict Management and Peace Science journal. That doesn’t include overt US-backed coups like the ones in Iran or Guatemala in the 1950s, or military interventions like in Iraq or Libya.
With the US leading the campaign for the world to recognize a self-appointed president, Juan Guaidó, as the new leader of Venezuela and the NSA, Bolton, advocating regime change in Iran, it’s clear that Washington’s approach remains the same. Till it changes, so should India’s.

Historic Nature of Latina's Campaign Drew Attention But Not Enough Support
In South Texas, a candidate named Dolly Elizondo had a chance to make history as the first Latina from Texas to serve in Congress. Those involved say she struggled to translate national interest into sufficient local support.

Dolly Elizondo
WASHINGTON — It’s not often national magazines profile a Congressional candidate in an obscure House race. But in South Texas this winter, a candidate named Dolly Elizondo had a chance to make history.
Elizondo, a Democrat, was running to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Rubén Hinojosa, D-Edinburg. If successful, she would have been the first Latina from Texas to serve in Congress, and the first freshman female Texan elected to a full term in 20 years.
History, however, didn’t happen.
On March 1, Elizondo placed third in the six-way Democratic primary behind attorney Vicente Gonzalez and Edinburg school board member Juan “Sonny” Palacios, Jr.

More bruising, she missed the May 24 runoff by a mere 1,026 votes out of more than 50,000 cast.
“A thousand votes,” sighed Houston attorney Amber Mostyn, a prominent national Democratic donor and Elizondo backer. “It’s a hard loss.”
While some Elizondo supporters say her campaign was always going to face challenges trying to elect the first Texas Latina to Congress, a postmortem analysis reveals several other issues Elizondo ran into: strong competition, a condensed primary and a lack of money. The overall picture that emerges is one of a campaign that drew some statewide and national interest from Democrats but not enough concrete financial or logistical support to translate that excitement into a winning campaign.
The Rio Grande Valley is a region Texas Democratic operatives widely describe as particularly difficult — if not outright hostile — to female candidates. Despite Hillary Clinton's success there this year, voters in the region have proven historically less open to female candidates lower on the ballot.
But Elizondo's background made her seem like that rare candidate who could break the rules and make history. She brought to the campaign an up-from-her-bootstraps story of a single mother who raised her daughters while earning bachelor's and masters degrees. She went on to own her own real estate business.
She was also a local political insider, serving both as chairwoman of the Hidalgo County Democratic Party and on the board of Annie's List, an organization that aims to elect Democratic women to state office.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Hinojosa officially announced his retirement on Nov. 13. Elizondo declared her campaign in early December.
Elizondo joined a crowded field, and Palacios and Gonzalez quickly emerged as her top rivals. Palacios served on a local school board and was from an eminent political family locally. Gonzalez was not well known, but his campaign quickly began airing holiday-themed television ads.
Elizondo had little time to build up her campaign. The holidays make December a notoriously terrible time for political fundraising. The remaining calendar left about six weeks in the new year for her to raise her profile locally and among national donors before early voting started.
But on Jan. 31, freshly filed campaign finance reports dropped a bomb on the Elizondo campaign: Gonzalez had loaned his campaign $750,000. That amount would eventually escalate to $1.2 million before the primary was over.
In comparison, Elizondo raised a little shy of $300,000 over the entire primary cycle. Her eventual haul actually surpassed that of Palacios, who raised about $220,000. While some of that was Palacios' own investment, his operation also benefited from his family's decadeslong ties to the region.
Gonzalez tapped his campaign account to put billboards along Interstate 2. He also spent heavily on TV ads. It was soon apparent Elizondo was in a fight for second place with Palacios.
But the 15th Congressional District is a poor district, and if Elizondo was to overcome Palacios’ operation and Gonzalez’s war chest, she would have to raise big money herself, particularly outside the district's borders.
"No matter where the money was going to come from, money was a factor," Elizondo said Thursday. "You can't really deny that."

Along with pumping $90,000 of her own money into her campaign, Elizondo also received a boost in donations thanks largely to an endorsement from EMILY’s List, a national group that backs female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights. Beyond the endorsement, EMILY’s List plugged her candidacy to other donors and sent staffers to support her campaign.
While EMILY's List made a direct donation to Elizondo's campaign of $5,000, its super PAC did not invest in the race. In comparison, the super PAC has spent or committed at least $1 million to back the group's preferred candidates in two U.S. Senate primary races.
Despite the super PAC's lack of involvement, Elizondo said EMILY's List was on the ground before she even launched her campaign, and the group's endorsement helped her make her case to donors.
"Their endorsement was the pathway to raising the money that I did raise to begin with," Elizondo said. "I couldn't have done it without them."
And a group spokeswoman said the organization would keep an eye on her in the future.
“Dolly ran an outstanding campaign, and we were proud to be there with her every step of the way,” said EMILY’s List spokeswoman Rachel Thomas. “We know that Dolly will continue to be a leader in her community, and we can’t wait to see what she does next.”
Elizondo also drew the support of dozens of Texas donors, many of whom were members of Annie's List, which is something of a Texas state-level sister to EMILY's List. Former state Sen. Wendy Davis wrote two personal checks to the campaign, and state Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-San Antonio, sent money from her campaign. Mostyn, the major Democratic donor, maxed out with $8,100 in support, but campaign finance rules prevented much of that money from being spent until a would-be runoff and general election.
If Elizondo was hoping the historic nature of her campaign would help further boost her campaign fund, she was likely disappointed. There was no obvious organized effort in Washington to push for a Texas Hispanic congresswoman. U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, was the lone federal officeholder to send Elizondo money.
So why didn’t any other female members give?
Gillibrand's political antenna is tuned specifically to support female Democratic candidates. In recent years, the junior senator from New York has emerged as a chief national recruiter, mentor and donor to future congresswomen.
But Gillibrand is a senator, not a member of the U.S. House. Several Democratic Capitol Hill sources noted that representatives are often reluctant to take sides in a primary unless they have longtime loyalties with a candidate. The risk is that a bet on a losing candidate translates to starting off on the wrong foot with the victor, a new colleague.
Further working against Elizondo was strong interest by House Democrats to end their six-year run in the minority. The notion of a potentially divisive Republican like real estate magnate Donald Trump or U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz at the top of the ballot makes some Democrats cautiously wonder if that could swing enough races around the country for the House gavel to be in play.
With that in the minds of many Democratic operatives, picking favorites in primaries became harder to justify. Instead, the prevailing aim was is to channel every dollar into the fall races.
During an interview over breakfast on the first day of early voting, Elizondo interrupted herself when she saw former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appear on a television screen.
“There’s my girl,” she exclaimed.
Irony of ironies, Elizondo’s idol probably hurt her own political efforts. While the notion of the first Texas Latina in Congress excited feminist circles, it’s largely an afterthought when the country is poised to nominate the first female major party candidate in history.
Three weeks later, Elizondo said the historical significance of her candidacy turned out to be more difficult to impart than she had hoped.
"I think that message was conveyed too late to stakeholders, and they had to think about it," Elizondo said. "There should have been planning ahead of time in case a seat became vacant."
For Mostyn and many other state and national promoters of women in public office, it was progress that a woman even ran a credible campaign for a South Texas seat. Open seats created by retirements are the best opportunities for women to run. Aside from current veteran incumbents like U.S. Reps. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth and Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, it's hard to recall the last time a Texas woman launched a viable campaign for Congress.
“It’s encouraging because we do need to get more female representation at the higher levels of government for that area of the state,” Mostyn said of South Texas.
Elizondo said she hasn't ruled out a run in 2018. But that would probably be an even harder campaign as there's a general reluctance in the donor world to support candidates who challenge incumbents.
Even so, she said, seeds were planted for the future for herself or another Texas Latina.
"I'm so grateful for this opportunity because it opened everyone's eyes," she said.

Climate truce in sight as Labor warms to National Energy Guarantee

Labor would retain the Turnbull government's cornerstone energy policy but legally enforce deeper emissions cuts on the electricity industry, suggesting elusive bipartisan action on the climate crisis is within reach.
The pledge is a departure from the emissions intensity scheme Labor took to the 2016 election, and comes days out from pivotal negotiations between the Commonwealth and the states over the design of the Coalition's policy, known as the National Energy Guarantee
Loading
Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Mark Butler on Monday said if the NEG was implemented, a future Labor government would legislate to lift the policy's emissions reduction target for the electricity sector to match Labor’s stronger national target.
Labor wants to slash emissions across the Australian economy by 45 per cent by 2030, based on 2005 levels. This is a far greater cut than the 26-28 per cent cut proposed by the government, which would also be applied to the electricity sector under the NEG.

Mr Butler said the government’s policy was too weak to effectively tackle climate change and shifted the burden of emissions reduction to other industries, as well as future generations.
“If the NEG is implemented by the Turnbull government ... in government Labor would legislate to scale the emissions reduction target under the NEG to be consistent with our whole of economy emissions reduction target,” Mr Butler said.
“Labor does not support the government trying to lock in weak emissions reduction targets, which will stifle renewable energy investment and make meeting our international obligations under the Paris Agreement practically impossible.”
The remarks suggest Labor has further warmed to the National Energy Guarantee after the latest iteration of the policy was circulated to energy ministers ahead of this Friday’s Council of Australian Governments talks.

Labor went to the last election pushing an emissions intensity scheme, which would have achieved its target of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030.
Labor is understood to be confident that it could deliver that target, and investment certainty, if the National Energy Guarantee is designed well – and in particular if it would allow future governments to ratchet up emissions reductions.
Any agreement at COAG would need to be passed by Parliament. If Labor won the election, it would also need parliamentary approval for its plan to lift the targets.
A leaked copy of the Turnbull government’s plans for the policy, published by Fairfax Media on Monday, suggested the emisisons reduction target would be reviewed only every five years.
The energy security board, which is designing the policy, said energy companies needed certainty to manage their investments, and feedback had indicated the proposed approach struck the right balance between certainty and flexibility.
It is understood Labor would override that timing through legislation, but would seek to carefully manage the change to ensure it was not rushed.
Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said the guarantee would deliver lower electricity prices, greater reliability and help Australia meet its emission reduction targets under the Paris climate deal.
The energy industry itself has pushed for deeper emissions cuts under the NEG, saying it could do more to carry the burden of carbon reduction for other industries.
Australian Industry Group public policy adviser Tennant Reed said: “Nowadays it’s easier to see how deeper emissions reductions can happen in the electricity sector compared the manufacturing or agricultural industries.”
Origin, AGL and EnergyAustralia have also pushed towards low or zero emissions by 2050 or earlier. One energy insider said the higher targets, if implemented, were likely to be just part of the energy sector’s journey towards their 2050 commitment.
NSW and Victoria, the two most populous states, offered divergent responses to the NEG plans on Monday.
NSW energy minister Don Harwin predicted debate over state targets within the national one would "be a large part" of Friday's discussion among ministers.
Still, he said changes in the design to ensure greater competition compared with the initial outline were "a good step forward", and he remained "optimistic" the NEG would "massively change the game" in Australia's electricity sector.
His Victorian counterpart, Lily D'Ambrosio, remained concerned the states and territories had been given too little detail and time to consider it.
"We can only make the National Energy Guarantee work if we are presented with a sound policy proposal backed by evidence and consultation," Ms D'Ambrosio said.
"We want a genuine commitment from the Turnbull government for bipartisanship in lowering emissions, growing renewables and market reform."

Union bankrolls Greens

THE Greens have received their largest-ever political donation with a disaffected Victorian blue-collar union giving $325,000 to help the party win the seat of Melbourne and its first Victorian Senate spot.
The Electrical Trades Union's Victorian branch - which until last month was affiliated with Labor - recently gave $125,000 to the campaign to elect Greens candidate Adam Bandt in the marginal seat of Melbourne.
A further $200,000 has been donated to help Richard Di Natale become the first Greens senator for Victoria.
The donation dwarfs previous amounts given to the Greens - in 2007-08 its national office declared total donations of just $170,000 - and comes as the party has won support from other blue-collar unions. It is believed the Victorian branch of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) has donated about $50,000 to the Greens' Senate campaign.
ETU state secretary Dean Mighell said the support was due to the Greens' better industrial relations policies and their strong support for abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission.

''The only party that is on the side of our members is the Greens. They have an absolute commitment to abolish the ABCC and restore workers' rights,'' he said.
Mr Mighell said his union would make small donations to the marginal-seat campaigns of Labor's Mike Symon in Deakin and Darren Cheeseman in Corangamite. In the 2007 election campaign, the ETU spent hundreds of thousands to get those two candidates elected.
The donation to Mr Bandt, who has done work for the ETU as a lawyer, sees the union oppose former ACTU senior industrial officer Cath Bowtell, who is the Labor candidate for Melbourne.
Mr Mighell said he ''liked and respected'' Ms Bowtell but ''at the end of the day she will have to toe the Labor line''.
But Australian Services Union assistant national secretary Linda White said Ms Bowtell had broad support from left and right unions. She said Ms Bowtell was a better candidate who understood issues such as social inclusion and ''embodies great Labor progressive values''.
Ms Bowtell said she was grateful for the support she had received from the Melbourne community, Labor Party members, unions and a range of groups including Labor law firms.
Mr Di Natale said the donation to the Greens was ''a sign that there are unions that understand our policy on industrial relations, in particular the abolition of the ABCC, along with our strong support for the renewable energy sector, is in the interests of unions like the ETU''.
With the Greens likely to hold the balance of power in the Senate, the Master Builders Association of Victoria is spending about $100,000 on advertisements in Victorian marginal seats warning about the Greens' economic policies and their promise to abolish the ABCC.
Master Builders spokesman Asher Judah said they were running a ''Greens policy awareness'' campaign as builders were concerned about the long-term viability of their industry.
Mr Judah said the CFMEU's support for the Greens was bizarre as their policies would put its members in the dole queue.
''The Greens want to ban logging, end coal mining and shut down all of Australia's coal-fire power stations,'' he said.
The Greens' opposition to the ABCC has appealed to some unions, which are angry about Labor's failure to abolish the watchdog and its controversial interrogation powers.
Instead, Labor has tried to replace it with a new industry regulator with watered-down fines and other powers while keeping a version of the interrogation powers.

Top #Trump quotes from first #GOP2016 debate
August 6, 2015 Staff
“Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, my employees, myself and my family,” Trump said. “I have never gone bankrupt.”
“What am I saying?”
Trump responded by criticizing the banks he was in business with, and by suggesting the question was naive.
“First of all these lenders are not babies,” Trump responded. “They are killers. These are not the nice sweet little people you think. You are living in the world of make-believe, Chris, if you want to know the truth.”
Trump took a shot at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has been publicly criticized for the number of casinos that have failed on the famous boardwalk.
“I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, by the way,” Trump said. “Caesars just went bankrupt. Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City has gone bankrupt.”

WaPo Editor Used Cancer-Stricken Alex Trebek in an Attack on Trump
March 9, 2019 - 2 Comments.	
As the left-wing’s Trump Derangement Syndrome continues to mount, Democrats are being more and more ridiculous with their desperate attempts to attack the president at any turn.
On Friday, Washington Post editor Drew Goins landed in hot water after politicizing the cancer struggle of TV host Alex Trebek for the sake of taking a shot at President Trump, as documented by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
Reviewing Goins’ Remarks
Goins’ started off his commentary by bemoaning the apparent lack of truth which he believes exists in America. From this point, the Washington Post editor accused President Trump of making “8,158 false or misleading claims” within the first half of his presidency. Goins apparently saw it as appropriate to tie in his anti-Trump rhetoric with the plight which Trebek is working to overcome against stage four cancer.
In Goins’ own words:
Special: Dems don't want you to know about this Special Coin!
“We arguably live in an anti-expertise world. Americans can’t tell opinion from fact. Truth has always been valuable, but its present scarcity makes it feel especially precious. So when Trebek announced Wednesday that he had been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which carries a particularly low survival rate, it felt like we were grieving the potential loss of more than an avuncular quiz-show host. The loss of Trebek means the loss of a zone where the truth is clear and uncontested.”
Feedback to Goins’ Remarks
The Washington Post editor rightfully engendered criticism for his remarks. Numerous observers urged him against politicizing Trebek’s cancer struggle. Others censured Goins for bringing his dislike of President Trump into the equation at all. In a nutshell, many Americans viewed what Goins said as inappropriate and uncalled for.
When the right-wing talks about Trump Derangement Syndrome, Goins is a prime example. This editor of the Washington Post couldn’t even acknowledge a man’s struggle with cancer without finding some way to make it about President Trump. In all honestly, Drew Goins ought to be ashamed of himself, but his conduct speaks volumes about where the Democrat Party stands today.
Special: Unhappy with your Medicare Plan? Change it today under the new TrumpCare plan.
What do you think about this latest display of Trump Derangement Syndrome? Let us know in the comments section down below!

Space, lasers, hypersonic missiles rank high for U.S. missile defense research
Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin told attendees at a missile defense event that good progress is being made on lasers, but more work is needed for hypersonic weapons and enemy space denial efforts.

Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and former head of NASA, Michael Griffin told attendees at a missile defense event Tuesday that the U.S. was making good progress on directed energy weapons for missile defense, but that threats from hypersonic missiles and enemy space denial efforts still require a lot of work.
While all three areas have not been newly elevated on the list of priorities, they are at different points of research while carrying equal importance for national defense, Griffin told attendees at the CSIS Missile Defense Project on Tuesday morning.
Griffin said that though the attitude among many analysts still runs towards an axiom of "lasers are the weapon of the future and always will be," the United States has already developed lasers of military utility and will be investing heavily in scaling up laser range and power.
"In onesies and twosies we can field 10kw," Griffin said, referring to the power output of available lasers and how they can currently be fielded in small numbers.
RELATED Russia test-fires Kinzhal hypersonic missile
He said that that directed energy weapons utilizing lasers or microwaves were going to be the only viable long-term countermeasure against enemy "swarm" attacks using missiles, drones and small boats.
"I see no kinetic way of doing that effectively," Griffin said in regard to conventional weapons like guns and missiles.
He said that future Department of Defense funding would reflect this priority across the services, as well as at the Missile Defense Agency. "You are going to see an increased emphasis on laser scaling across several technologies," Griffin predicted.
RELATED Lockheed awarded $928M for hypersonic strike weapon
Griffin warned that U.S. supremacy in space surveillance could be threatened by enemy anti-satellite and space denial efforts due to assets being too concentrated in small numbers of high-value platforms.
"It is no secret the U.S. has the most sophisticated space surveillance capabilities of any nation," Griffin said, but added "these are juicy targets."
Griffin said the military needs to "disaggregate" it's capabilities into larger numbers of smaller satellites to improve resistance to attacks.
RELATED Lockheed Martin, General Atomics, Boeing compete for laser-armed drone
Grfffin said that above all, the U.S. must focus on keeping space accessible for all non-belligerents, much like the U.S. Navy's primary mission is maintaining freedom of navigation on the ocean.
"We need to make it clear ... the United States will maintain freedom of access to and movement in space by the U.S. and it's allies." Space assets "control how we fight on Earth. We are not as prolific in low-earth orbit as I would like us to be."
He also said that U.S. early-warning radars, satellites and interceptors are focused on detecting and countering conventional ballistic missiles, while hypersonic missiles would require different capabilities to stop.
While the U.S. has done "all the initial research" on hypersonic missiles, the decision not to weaponize it is coming back in the form of a threat from China and Russia, which Griffin said have done "dozens" of tests for the weapons.
Hypersonic missiles would operate at very high-speed in the Mach 5+ range and would operate at lower altitudes than ballistic missiles. Combining speed and evasive maneuverability, they would be very difficult to track and stop with current interceptors.
When asked by reporters about the long-awaited release of the Missile Defense Review, Griffin said he has no answers on it and that it would be up to the Trump Administration to decide when and how it would be disseminated.

Solar Plus Energy Storage Not Yet Cost Effective
22nd August 2017
Sustainability News
Aug 22, 2017
By Editors of Power Engineering
A new study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicated current solar facilities with on-site battery storage are not yet as economical as solar facilities without on-site storage.
The study, which examined solar systems in Southern California, indicated the cost of the batteries along with 2014 solar electricity prices caused the cost-benefit ratio to fall well short of standalone solar arrays.
Though AC-coupled and DC-coupled systems increased the cost-benefit ratio slightly, even 30 percent investment tax credits only pushed the ratio to just below 1.4. Photovoltaic solar alone had a cost-benefit ratio of slightly above 1.4.
As the energy storage market continues to mature, battery costs should fall. However, the study indicated energy storage would provide a much better cost to benefit ratio in areas with higher photovoltaic penetrations than solar alone by 2020. Solar plus storage would show a cost-benefit ratio mostly similar to solar alone, not including investment tax credits.

A Bigger Deal Than Oil Exports
Tom Randall
December 17, 2015
The clean-energy boom is about to be transformed. In a surprise move, U.S. lawmakers agreed to extend tax credits for solar and wind for another five years. This will give an unprecedented boost to the industry and change the course of deployment in the U.S.
The extension will add an extra 20 gigawatts of solar power—more than every panel ever installed in the U.S. prior to 2015, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). The U.S. was already one of the world's biggest clean-energy investors. This deal is like adding another America of solar power into the mix.

When White Christians Get More Isolated & Less Tolerant...

October 22, 2018
News
Last year, the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) put out a new report on religion in America that measured a truly remarkable shift: For the first time, almost certainly in the country’s history, people who identify as white Christians are a minority of Americans. Four out of every five Americans were self-described white Christians in 1976, but now that group only constitutes 43 percent of the U.S. population.
There are a lot of reasons for this shift, study author Robert P. Jones, who heads PRRI and is the author of “The End of White Christian America,” explained to Salon in an interview. To a large extent, Jones said, it’s the trend of “young, white people leaving Christian churches that is driving up the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans.”
This reflects, he added, “a culture clash between particularly conservative white churches and denominations and younger Americans” over issues like science, particularly climate change and evolution, and especially the rights of LGBT people.
It’s a battle that goes a long way towards explaining the “Nashville statement,” released last month by the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. While the statement includes some language criticizing straight people who fail to practice “chastity outside of marriage,” by and large it is meant as an attack on LGBT Americans, suggesting, for instance, that no good Christians can “approve of homosexual immorality or transgenderism.”
“The younger generation, Americans under the age of 30 — more than eight in 10 of them support same-sex marriage,” Jones said, adding that the issue has become “a litmus test issue for many millennials in the country.”
“It’s not just that conservative white Christians have lost this argument with a broader liberal culture,” he noted. “It’s that they’ve lost it with their own kids and grandchildren.”
Statistics seem to bear this out. A slim majority of young white evangelicals now support same-sex marriage, while older generations of white evangelicals overwhelmingly oppose it. That difference doesn’t even take into account the huge numbers of young people who were raised in evangelical denominations and then left their churches, often because they disapprove of religious homophobia.
These trends lead Jones to believe that the Nashville statement was not really aimed at the larger American culture. Rather, it was an attempt by older, more conservative evangelicals to “reassert a view that has certainly lost its footing” with their own children and grandchildren. This is why, he speculated, the language is less “fire and brimstone” in nature than similar documents in the past.
A recent Washington Post op-ed by Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, also suggests that the Nashville statement is an effort to sell the younger generation on accepting homophobia by soft-pedaling the hate.
“In releasing the Nashville Statement, we, in fact, are acting out of love and concern for people who are increasingly confused about what God has clarified in Holy Scripture,” Mohler wrote. (“Confused” is conservative Christian-speak for gay, bisexual or transgender — identities that the Nashville statement directly denies exist.)
Mohler went on to insist that the document was simply an effort to clarify and build on a view that marriage is “a covenantal, sexual, procreative, lifelong union of one man and one woman” and that “[c]hastity outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage are affirmed.”
This “love the sinner, hate the sin” spin was a hard sell before, and in the age of Donald Trump, it’s downright laughable. Not only did white evangelicals vote for Trump, but they voted for him in even greater numbers than they had for any other Republican before him — giving Trump even more support than they gave George W. Bush, who is one of their own. The more churchy the white evangelical, the more likely he or she is to support Trump. Many of the signatories of the Nashville statement (though not Mohler) also publicly lent their support to Trump. Signatory James Dobson even justified his choice by saying that Trump “appears to be tender to things of the Spirit,” which can only be described as a ludicrous claim, whether one is religious or not.
Trump committed adultery during his first two marriages and during his current marriage, has bragged on tape about apparently assaulting women. When asked about forgiveness during a Christian-oriented campaign event designed to make him look like a believer, Trump made clear that he had never asked God for forgiveness for these or any other sins and seemed confused about why he would have needed to.
The white evangelical support for Trump, coupled with the continued denunciation of LGBT people, makes it clear this is not and never was about morality, sexual or otherwise. Instead, “morality” is a fig leaf for the true agenda of the Christian right, which is asserting a strict social hierarchy based on gender.
The same-sex marriage question is a stand-in issue, Jones argued, for “a whole worldview” that is “a kind of patriarchal view of the family, with the father head of the household and the mother staying home.”
“I think that’s why this fight is as visceral as it is,” he added.
Trump may be an unrepentant sinner, but he is a supporter of this patriarchal worldview, where straight men are in charge, women are quiet and submissive and people who fall outside these old-school heterosexual norms are marginalized. Voting for him was an obvious attempt by white evangelicals to impose this worldview on others, including (and perhaps especially) their own children, who are starting to ask hard questions about a moral order based on hierarchy and rigid gender roles instead of one built on empathy and kindness.

Border Protection says NYC mayor crossed border illegally
The Associated Press
Wednesday
Jul 11, 2018 at 2:39 PM
Bill De Blasio, a fierce critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies, went to the Texas border with about 20 other mayors from around the country on June 21.
WASHINGTON — New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his security detail violated both Mexican and U.S. immigration laws by crossing the border on foot during a visit near El Paso, Texas, U.S. Customs and Border Protection alleges in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.
The mayor's office flatly denied the allegation.
De Blasio, a fierce critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies, went to the Texas border with about 20 other mayors from around the country on June 21, the day after President Donald Trump signed an order stopping family separations at the border.
More than 2,300 families were separated as a result of the administration's zero tolerance policy, which criminally prosecutes anyone caught crossing illegally. The mayors said Trump had failed to address a humanitarian crisis of his own making.
De Blasio went to a holding facility for immigrant children but was denied entry. He then went to Mexico and crossed into the U.S. to get a better view of the facility. The New York Police Department runs de Blasio's security detail.
According to the letter, a uniformed Border Patrol agent noticed a group standing in the Rio Grande flood plain south of the Tornillo, Texas, port of entry, taking photos of the holding facility. The agent asked if anyone from Border Patrol or public affairs was there to authorize their presence. An NYPD inspector said no, according to the letter, and when the agent asked the group how they arrived, they pointed to Mexico.
The agent told them they'd crossed the border illegally and asked them to remain there while he got a supervisor and took them to an official crossing for an inspection per federal law, according to the letter. But the group disregarded the order, walking back to their vehicles and drove back to Mexico, according to the letter. They re-entered by car through a port of entry about three hours later, the letter said.
De Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips said the group did nothing illegal and had approval to be there.
"The mayor crossed the border with the direct approval and under the supervision of the border patrol supervisor at this port of entry," Phillips said in an email Tuesday night to the AP. "Any suggestion otherwise is a flat-out lie and an obvious attempt by someone to attack the Mayor because of his advocacy for families being ripped apart at the border by the Trump Administration."
A spokesman for the Border Protection had no comment.
"U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the United States Border Patrol take violations of law very seriously," the letter said.
The letter was sent June 25 by Aaron Hull, the chief patrol agent for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector to New York Police Department Commissioner James O'Neill.

Moving Companies in Wallingford, CT

Wallingford
Are you planning to move? Moving homes or offices in Wallingford, CT can be a big decision with a lot of moving parts (pun intended). That's where Wirefly comes in. We make it easy for you to find and compare the best moving companies in Wallingford, CT, including home movers, office movers, long distance movers, international movers, and auto transport companies to make your move as simple and pain free as possible.
Local Movers in Wallingford, CT
No matter if you’re simply moving around town in Wallingford, CT or to the opposite part of the state, you should consult a moving company to help manage your transition. However, when planning your move with a professional mover, keep in mind that once they pass your state line, it is considered a long-distance move. This means that not only can they charge more, but it may be illegal for their company to perform such as move.
Just like any move, you have to prepare the same and consider any concerns you have with your movers. This is why it’s so important to do proper research on the best intrastate movers to use. When choosing what moving company to go with, consider the following questions: What kind of truck do you need? Do you need a pre-rented storage facility or does your home have adequate space? Will your movers pack your belongings, or do you plan to do that? Is the moving company you’re hiring as fully insured and licensed? Do you have a prepared budget? Have you gotten quotes from a variety of moving companies in Wallingford, CT? Although you may not have all the answers to these questions, Wirefly is here to help you make your final decision on hiring a professional moving company.
Long Distance Moving Companies in Wallingford, CT
If you cross just one state line or many state lines, your move is now officially considered a long distance move. If you briefly cross state lines to get to your destination quicker, it is now considered a long distance move, even if you're living in the same state. This phenomenon is usually seen in states with uneven state lines like Idaho, Minnesota, Texas, and Wisconsin. Every long distance moving company in Wallingford, CT have to have a license from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). This Administration is responsible for regulating the residential moving and trucking industry. Even if Wirefly works only with companies who have their proper documents, it is always a good idea to do your research. You can go onto the USDOT website and look for performance records, accident, and complaint forms.
Long distance moving costs more than a local move, so it is always a good idea to consider every variable for your own, individual move when you compare referrals. When you get separate quotes, ask them the same questions that are listed in the checklist above. This practice will ensure you only choose companies who offer all of the services you are after, and you will get correct quotes. For every quote you receive, you should ask for a binding contract. This contract will list every expense estimate and serve as a guarantee that no hidden fees will be added later on.
International Movers in Wallingford, CT
It is extremely challenging to relocate to the new country, including moving your belongings through international means. There aren't many international moving companies that are extremely reliable, reputable, or can handle the difficult move from Wallingford, CT to a new country. Wirefly has the answers that many customers are seeking in this case.
Moving companies based outside of the United States have to have a good standing with the FIDI. The FIDI is a global alliance, the largest to be exactly, that is a professional relocation and international moving company group. Though Wirefly makes it easy to get an international moving quote, the company recommends that the customers review the history of each company before hiring them. They can check out each company's history of the American Moving & Storage Association, the Better Business Bureau, or the Household Goods Forwarder Associate websites.
Best Office Movers in Wallingford, CT
Moving an office is a much different job than moving a home so it requires a moving company that specializes specifically in that. The typical office will have all kinds of important equipment, such as servers, computer systems, phone systems, printers, copy machines and many smaller items. To make sure those items arrive safely at the new location, consumers need the right moving company. A licensed and insured office moving company in Wallingford, CT will have movers who know how to transport high-tech equipment, break down cubicles and pack smaller items in hard crates.
There’s also the time factor to consider. While consumers want personal moves done quickly, they may have a few days to spare for the unpacking process. That isn’t true with office relocations, because businesses can’t take much time off. The right office movers will be able to work without bothering clients and employees, and complete the entire move in as little as just a single day.
People who are moving can find the best, most reputable office movers in Wallingford, CT on Wirefly, as we only work with movers that have a proven track record. Wirefly only puts office moving companies in its network if it’s sure they’ll handle every state of the move with care and professionalism.
Although perhaps not the most intimidating part of moving, getting your car to your new destination is definitely the scariest part. Trusting a moving company to transport the one thing that gets you to and from every important part of your life is a hard thing to do. Wirefly guarantees to help you find reliable and reputable companies in Wallingford, CT to ship your car at a good rate.
Most people do not consider the need to transport their vehicle until it is too late. Shipping your car to or from Wallingford, CT can be necessary for many reasons. Usually people will drive their own car to their moving destination, but this is not always the case. The most common reason for needing an auto transporting company is if you are driving the moving truck yourself and have no other way of getting your own vehicle there with you. You could also have multiple cars in the family but not enough people to drive them. You might also need to use a moving company to ship your vehicle if you are moving overseas or any other long distance.
Wirefly only works with auto shipping companies who are properly licensed and insured, guaranteeing you a peaceful move. It is our mission to take care of all the moving issues you might be losing sleep over. Whether it be your personal belonging or your car, Wirefly will not only help you find a trustworthy company but also a good rate. Moving doesn't have to be stressful. You deserve to have these things taken care of for you so you can focus on all the fun parts of moving.

Faulty vaccines spark public outrage in China
By Gary Alvernia
8 August 2018
A scandal involving faulty vaccines in China has caused widespread public anger against both the government and major corporations. The revelations last month demonstrate the systematic neglect of proper standards for production and safety testing, along with cover-ups by the pharmaceutical company, Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology.
The scandal initially broke on July 15 when China’s Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) announced that Changsheng had forged data while improperly producing and storing approximately 113,000 rabies vaccines. This was done to cut costs, according to a government investigation team.
Five days later, the CFDA also revealed that it had been investigating the company since last November for selling 250,000 ineffective doses of the DPT vaccine, a combined vaccine for diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus. Despite evidence of criminal negligence, the CFDA allowed Changsheng to continue its operations, only revoking its “good manufacturing practices” (GMP) licence in response to the rabies vaccine scandal.
While “vaccine” quickly became the most censored word in China, this did not prevent an enormous number of critical comments and postings on social media sites like Weibo and WeChat. The social media hashtag, #Changsheng vaccine case, received over 470 million views within a week, with many stating that the exposure had undermined their trust in the authorities.
In comments typical of the responses, one Weibo user asked, “If the state does not protect its citizens, how can we love our country?” Another said, “All my friends are freaking out with this vaccine case, everyone is scared. It really reflects big loopholes and issues with China’s food and drug safety regulation.”
Yanzhong Huang, an adjunct senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated in the Washington Post, “The incident, if not properly handled… could evolve into a legitimacy crisis. The environment, corruption, food safety, and now vaccines. These things add up and they can really pose challenges to government legitimacy.”
As with previous incidents involving public safety, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has addressed the public outrage with a combination of palliative measures, empty rhetoric and censorship. Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have weighed in on the issue, denouncing it as “crossing a moral line” and promising severe punishment. Gao Jungfang, the billionaire chairwoman of Changsheng, and 17 other senior officials have been arrested.
Any punishment, however, will likely be a slap on the wrist. The provincial branch of the CFDA in Jilin, where Changsheng is based, has already fined the company a paltry 3.4 million yuan ($502,200). The company’s 2017 profits were 566 million yuan ($83 million), an increase of nearly 32 percent over 2016, while it was also receiving a 48.3 million yuan ($7.1 million) government subsidy.
The impact on the estimated 200,000 people administered the faulty DPT vaccines, mostly children, is not yet known. Effects could range from being completely ineffective, putting the children at risk of contracting dangerous diseases, to causing side-effects and reactions, particularly if the vaccines themselves became contaminated with bacteria or other substances.
Changsheng was the second-largest producer of the rabies vaccine in China, manufacturing a quarter of the country’s doses. Rabies is a significant public health concern in China, which has the second highest reported rate of the disease in the world and over 2,000 deaths annually. Although its prevalence in developed nations has been almost eliminated, rural and impoverished regions of the world continue to be affected. Almost 60,000 die from the disease every year worldwide.
The potential risks have understandably caused immense hardship and fear among much of the Chinese public. Many families have travelled to Hong Kong, which has a separate healthcare system, to receive medical care for themselves or their children, a difficult and expensive process that is not feasible for many millions of China’s working-class and rural families.
On Monday and Tuesday last week, dozens of parents and activists gathered outside buildings in Beijing in a public demonstration against the government. Protests were also held in Chongqing, in south-western China, and a group of parents confronted local health authorities in Weihai, an eastern port city in Shandong province.
“I thought about all the people involved, from the vaccine company to the regulators. They cannot be called human. They are devils in hell,” a Weihai mother, whose infant son had received the vaccine, told the Guardian newspaper.
While Chinese government officials have sought to portray these crimes as a result of malfeasance by just one company, the scandal is just the latest in a series of similar episodes in the industry.
In November 2017, when Changsheng was being investigated for its dubious DPT vaccines, another pharmaceutical company, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, was caught having sold over 400,000 faulty DPT vaccines. Both the company and regulatory authorities have since claimed that this negligence was “an accident” and that problems with its manufacturing process had been resolved, a finding unlikely to reassure anyone.
Last month China’s pharmaceutical corporations confronted an international crisis when the widely-used blood pressure medication Valsartan was recalled in 23 countries due to the presence of a carcinogen (cancer-causing substance) in one of its active ingredients. That ingredient was supplied by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals.
Many in China have also pointed to the contamination of milk formula with melamine (an industrial chemical used to make plastics) in 2008 that led to the deaths of six infants and caused over 300,000 children to fall ill. Eight years later in 2016, the same milk manufacturers were caught attempting to sell expired or counterfeit milk powder, which increased the risk of exposure to contaminated products or bacteria.
Ultimately, the problem is not limited to China or Chinese companies, but stems from the subordination of all aspects of healthcare to the capitalist system. Major corporations around the world are engaged in similar criminality, with the complicity of their respective national regulatory agencies. The opioid crisis in the United States, exacerbated by pharmaceutical companies illegally distributing large amounts of addictive painkillers to impoverished parts of the country, is but one example.

An appeal from David North, WSWS Editorial Board Chairman
', '
Trump has declared a global war on socialism. The working class is fighting back.
', //'
Oppose war, inequality and censorship!
', //'
For 20 years, the WSWS has provided daily, international news and analysis from the perspective of the working class. Our success depends entirely on your support.
', // '
At the June 30 nationwide pro-immigrant rallies, World Socialist Web Site reporting teams mass-distributed leaflets calling on the working class to defend immigrants, and published reports from 10 cities across the US.
', // '
Donate today to help us continue this critical work! Your support will allow us to print leaflets and signs, to travel to demonstrations, and to reach masses of people with the perspective of socialism.
', //'
The World Socialist Web Site depends entirely on the support of readers like you. Donate today to support the voice of international socialism!
', '
Every dollar donated translates into more workers gaining access to a socialist program and perspective.
