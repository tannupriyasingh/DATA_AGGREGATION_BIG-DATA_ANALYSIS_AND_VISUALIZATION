How To Recognize A Sociopath
Author : Larry N. Ely Date : September 15, 2017
We worry about what our docs will inform us – and so do they. Docs, scientists and medical researchers weigh in on health care and higher well being practices. Nurses are under valued which is why you hear nurses say their jobs are powerful. We, nonetheless, should not the only other profession that complain. Lecturers complain all the way in which till breaks about their lengthy hours, their beneath appreciation and the record goes on. They start complaining once more on Sunday and August when summer is over. They, nevertheless, have holidays off. Nurses don’t get holidays off. Instead, we are taking care of ungrateful, misguided individuals like the Sarahs. But we do it as a result of we love it. We just hold onto the memory of patients that make the Sarahs disappear.
Is it a HIPAA violation if an unknown patient is admitted to the hospital after they commit against the law and the social employee ask legislation enforcement to fingerprint the patient to allow them to attain household? Or does legislation enforcement have to request the fingerprints? Additionally if the affected person had not did any crime however was still unknown can a hospital social worker ask regulation enforcement for helping in identfting a affected person by fingerprinting? If yo ucan let me know where is the HIPAA law you find this information I’d be greatful.

Offtopic: Don't Just Vote. Vote for Democrats
4 monthes ago - By Calculated Risk
If you read my site, you know I'm focused on the facts. Donald Trump has always been at war with the data. From 2016:
Trump says he thinks the US unemployment rate is close to 20 percent and not the 5 percent reported by the Labor Department.
Anyone who believes the 5 percent is a “dummy,” he said. When asked yesterday about his dishonest and racist advertisements, Donald Trump said they are "effective". He doesn't care about the truth, just his version of "winning".
Note: Trump lies about almost everything .
The only way to stop the racist and hateful rhetorical and frequent lies is to...

How Did the Nazis Gain Power in Germany?

THE DEATH OF DEMOCRACY
Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic
By Benjamin Carter Hett
Illustrated. 280 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $30.
We ask about the rise of the Nazis from what we think is a great distance. We take for granted that the Germans of the 1930s were quite different from ourselves, and that our consideration of their errors will only confirm our superiority. The opposite is the case. Although Benjamin Carter Hett makes no comparisons between Germany then and the United States now in “The Death of Democracy,” his extremely fine study of the end of constitutional rule in Germany, he dissolves those comforting assumptions. He is not discussing a war in which Germans were enemies or describing atrocities that we are sure we could never commit. He presents Hitler’s rise as an element of the collapse of a republic confronting dilemmas of globalization with imperfect instruments and flawed leaders. With careful prose and fine scholarship, with fine thumbnail sketches of individuals and concise discussions of institutions and economics, he brings these events close to us.
The Nazis, in Hett’s account, were above all “a nationalist protest movement against globalization.” Even before the Great Depression brought huge unemployment to Germany, the caprice of the global economy offered an opportunity to politicians who had simple answers. In their 1920 program, the Nazis proclaimed that “members of foreign nations (noncitizens) are to be expelled from Germany.” Next would come autarky: Germans would conquer the territory they needed to be self-sufficient, and then create their own economy in isolation from that of the rest of the world. As Goebbels put it, “We want to build a wall, a protective wall.” Hitler maintained that the vicissitudes of globalization were not the result of economic forces but of a Jewish international conspiracy.
Image
Hett, a professor of history at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, sensitively describes a moral crisis that preceded a moral catastrophe. If Jews were held responsible for what happened in Germany, then Germans were victims and their actions always defensive. Political irresponsibility flowed from the unfortunate example of President Paul von Hindenburg. He was famous as the victor in a battle on the Eastern Front of World War I, even though the credit was not fully deserved. Hindenburg could not face the reality of defeat on the Western Front in 1918, and so spread the lie that the German Army had been “stabbed in the back” by Jews and Socialists. This moral weakness of one man radiated outward. Once Hindenburg won the presidential elections of 1925, Germany was trapped by his oversensitivity about a reputation that would not withstand scrutiny. He believed that only he could save Germany, but would not put himself forward to do so, for fear of damaging his image. Without Hindenburg’s founding fiction and odd posturing, it is unlikely that Hitler would have come to power.
As Hett capably shows, the Nazis were the great artists of victimhood fiction. Hitler, who had served with German Jews in the war, spread the idea that Jews had been the enemy within, proposing that the German Army would have won had some of them been gassed to death. Goebbels had Nazi storm troopers attack leftists precisely so that he could claim that the Nazis were victims of Communist violence. Hitler believed in telling lies so big that their very scale left some residue of credibility. The Nazi program foresaw that newspapers would serve the “general good” rather than reporting, and promised “legal warfare” against opponents who spread information they did not like. They opposed what they called “the system” by rejecting its basis in the factual world. Germans were not rational individuals with interests, the reasoning went, but members of a tribe that wanted to follow a leader (Führer).
Much of this was familiar from Italian Fascism, but Hitler’s attempt to imitate Mussolini’s March on Rome failed. When Hitler tried a coup d’état in 1924, he and the Nazis were easily defeated and he was sentenced to prison, where he wrote “Mein Kampf.” In Hett’s account, the electoral rise of the Nazis in the late 1920s and early 1930s had less to do with his particular ideas and more to do with an opening on the political spectrum. The Nazis filled a void between the Catholic electorate of the Center Party and a working class that voted Socialist or Communist. Their core constituents, Hett indicates, were Protestants from the countryside or small towns who felt themselves to be the victims of globalization.
Did the Nazis come to power through democratic elections? In Germany in the 1930s, as elsewhere, elections continued even as their meaning changed. The fact that the Nazis used violence to intimidate others meant that elections were not free in the normal sense. And the system was rigged in their favor by men in power who had no use for democracy or for democrats. The Nazis were by no means the handmaidens of German industry or the German military but, as Hett argues, both businessmen and officers formed lobbies in the late 1920s that aimed to break the republic and its bastion, the Social Democrats. They tended to confuse their particular interests in lower wages and higher military spending with those of the German nation as a whole. This made it easy to see the Social Democrats as foreign and hostile.
In a similarly titled book, “How Democracies Die,” the political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky have recently argued that the killers of democracy begin by using the law against itself. Constitutions break when ill-motivated leaders deliberately expose their vulnerabilities. Certainly this was the case in Germany in 1930. President Hindenburg was technically within his rights to dissolve the Reichstag, name a new chancellor and rule by decree. By turning what was meant to be an exceptional situation into the rule, however, he transformed the German government into a feuding clique disconnected from society. Governments dependent upon the president had no reason to think creatively about policy, despite the Great Depression. Voters flowed to both extremes, to the Communists and even more to the Nazis. The Nazis took advantage of an opportunity created by people who could destroy a republic while lacking the imagination to see what comes next.
When elections were called in 1932, the purpose was not to confirm democracy but to bring down the republic. Hindenburg and his advisers saw the Nazis as a group capable of creating a majority for the right. The elections were a “solution” to a fake crisis that had been, as Hett puts it, “manufactured by a political right wing that wanted to exclude more than half the population from political representation and refused even the mildest compromise.” It did not occur to the president’s camp that the Nazis would do as well as they did, or that their leader would escape their control. And so the feckless schemes of the conservatives realized the violent dreams of the Nazis. The Nazis won 37 percent of the vote, and Hitler became chancellor in January 1933. A few weeks later, he used the pretext of the arson of the Reichstag to pass an enabling act that in effect replaced the constitution.
Hindenburg died in 1934 believing that he had saved Germany and his own reputation. In fact, he had created the conditions for the great horror of modern times. Hett’s book is implicitly addressed to conservatives. Rather than asking how the left could have acted to stop Hitler, he closes his book by considering the German conservatives who aided Hitler’s rise, then changed their minds and plotted against him. Following the recent work of Rainer Orth, Hett says that the Night of the Long Knives, the blood purge of June 1934, was directed mainly against these right-wing opponents.
The conclusions for conservatives of today emerge clearly: Do not break the rules that hold a republic together, because one day you will need order. And do not destroy the opponents who respect those rules, because one day you will miss them.

Pac-Man, Centipede, Chris Columbus and More From Pixels
Posted On Jul 27 2015

Tag: Billy Mitchell, director, Home Alone, Peter, Pixels, Sandler
And like “Transformers”, “Pixels” has 1980’s nostalgia going for it. More than 30 years ago, NASA sent a time capsule into space that included popular arcade games, but the aliens misinterpreted the gesture as an act of war.
Director Chris Columbus helped define 1980s movies as the writer of “Gremlins” and “The Goonies“, before directing classic comedies like “Home Alone” and “Mrs. Doubtfire”. But the special effects are competent rather than dazzling, and the whole enterprise quickly runs out of steam long before its end.
He said “Pixels” was like a mixture of some of his past projects.
“I would start with a siesta every day for three hours”.
It’s actually the movie’s nominal star, Sandler, who drags things down here, caught up in another plot that requires a smart, hot woman (Michelle Monaghan) to fall in love with his grizzled man-child.
Production Designer Peter Wenham orchestrated the iconic video game characters that transition from their classic 8-bit forms to fully realized 3D threats. A comedy film is a departure from his role on TV – and Pixels never allows him to show what he can do. So they attack Earth, using video games as the models for their strikes. “We had to determine how that would work, what it would look like – when a Space Invaders bomb hits the asphalt, it blows a hole, but it also pixelates so that the asphalt turns into pixels”.
Along for the ride is Ludlow (Josh Gad), who Cooper and Brenner met at a video game competition.
“Adam had been developing (Pixels) for some time, and I was shocked that some of the rights were already in place such as Pac-Man and Centipede”.
Though it’s a less-horrifying idea than most of its siblings in the pits of ASM hell, “Pixels” is another story reverse-engineered so characters don’t mind that Sandler’s character, here a self-described nerd with no humility whatsoever, is a total asshole.
“When you have only put out four films in a year and only two made over $50 million, you can see why investors may get jumpy”, the Oracle said.
Then there’s hero No. 2, who exhibits some serious sexual confusion, first lusting after a video game character, then lusting after other men, then finally settling on an Amazonian princess. “But it’s more than that”.
When asked what he thinks about the film, Jean doesn’t give the usual Hollywood spin. But like any great heel, Mitchell plays mind games with Wiebe, and says things on camera like, “Oh, Billy Mitchell always has a plan”, to get under Wiebe (and the viewer’s) skin.

Status of CETPUpdated on : 29 Aug 2018
Assessment of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) in the industrial clusters comprising of medium and small scale industries
Small Scale Industries (SSI) generally find it difficult to establish and operate individual effluent treatment plant due to their limited size and scale of operations. However, as SSI are generally located at industrial areas/estates, the concept of Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) for the effluents from the industrial cluster has been developed to achieve satisfactory treatment through collective efforts. The monitoring and enforcement of a CETP as a single pollution source also become easier for regulatory agencies as compared to monitoring of large number of ETPs of individual SSI units.
Central Pollution Control Board carried out study during 2011-12 for assessment of actual need for common effluent treatment plants in the country and to know the industrial clusters to be serviced by these CETPs. The study has revealed that 193 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) have been installed in the country, which serve 212 industrial areas/estates.
Directions/Communications issued by CPCB regarding CETP are as follows:
The report gives following recommendations:

Mercedes delay engine upgrade due to 'quality issue'
Howard Perry
Jun 10, 2018
"Although we had hoped to introduce PU2 [power unit two] this weekend, a quality issue means that this has now been delayed by one race", a team spokesperson said.
Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull have each won two races this season.
Mercedes engines are used not only by the factory race team, but also by the Force India and Williams teams.
Asked about Ferrari's engine upgrade for Canada, which debuted in the back of the Haas and Sauber in Monaco, Vettel added: "It's always been the plan, so let's see".
"I've never driven the circuit in Montreal so I'm looking forward to driving there", said the Russian.
Haas driver Kevin Magnussen, of Denmark, comes through the hairpin during the first practice session at the Canadian Grand Prix auto race Friday, June 8, 2018, in Montreal.
"It's a great track and a real test for the driver and the vehicle".
Despite a poor weekend in Monaco, Haas is bringing a significant upgrade for this weekend and with the updated Ferrari engine will likely be a threat once again.
But others have also found the track to their liking including two of Hamilton's biggest challengers.
G7 summit fails to heal trade rift as Trump stands alone
Trump called the summit a "one time shot" for Kim, but expressed optimism at the beginning of talks with the North Korean regime. Trump said that America's trading partners would be making a mistake if they retaliated against new US tariffs.
Ferrari is apparently preparing for this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix, which is in Montreal, by having no idea where or what Montreal is.
Both Toro Rosso drivers, Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley, will have an upgraded Honda engine.
Sauber and Williams will continue to linger towards the back but have shown they can get drivers on the fringes of the top 10 when running well.
"It is of course Lance's home race, and also where he scored his first Formula 1 points previous year in his rookie season, so it holds good memories".
That is your look ahead to the possible stories to follow this weekend in Canada.
Certainly all the ingredients are in place for another thrilling Sunday afternoon as Hamilton, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Ricciardo bring their battle to Montreal.
Bottas played down the delay to the new engine, saying it would have been only "a small gain compared to the old one" anyway.
The team's struggles with the "hyper-soft" tyre in Monte Carlo undermined them in qualifying, but their strategic approach enabled Hamilton to finish third and extend his record run of points-scoring races to 31.

Good Food Org Guide
Presented By The James Beard Foundation, Food Tank, and Valhrona, along with a prestigious advisory group of food system experts.
The vision and objective of this publication is to focus attention on the dozens of nonprofit organizations who are working in fields, kitchens, classrooms, laboratories, businesses, town halls, board rooms, and Congress to create a better food system.
“We hope this guide will serve as a resource for chefs, farmers, students, advocates, and others to find the resources they need about the growing good food movement in the U.S.,” said Susan Ungaro, Former President of the James Beard Foundation.
These groups include organizations who combat childhood obesity, malnourishment, and physical inactivity; prevent food waste; educate consumers on healthy, nutritious food choices; create networks of social entrepreneurs; protect food and restaurant workers; highlight solutions for restoring the health of people and the planet; work with indigenous communities to preserve traditions, culture, and biodiversity; inspire and educate individuals to cook more of their own food; and protect public health, human health, and the environment.
ABOUT THE GUIDE

Guest Commentary The Logic of Failure
May 30, 2018 Stella Evans

Humans have evolved a variety of psychological strategies to help us cope with the aversive consequences of failure, some of which are more productive than others. We generally don’t like failure—especially when we have invested significant emotional energy and/or effort into the hoped-for outcome—and try to make ourselves feel better when it occurs. Much of the time, our preferred explanations are those that defend and/or boost our self-images.
The purpose of this comment is to set out a few of these psychological strategies and apply them to a recent event considered by some to have been a failure: the vote by Redding residents to reject the budget proposals from the Board of Finance and Region 9 School Board. People (especially those who supported the budgets) were shocked and disappointed and, as would be expected, sought to understand the reasons for this surprising setback.
The explanations that I observed in individual discussions, at public meetings, in social media, and in emails sent to me include:
Denial: denying that the failure occurred by stating that the “cause” was right but people misunderstood it and mistakenly voted against it;
Deflection and blame: praising one’s own role while claiming the outcome was someone else’s’ fault;
Insulting others: engaging in ad hominem attacks (whether publicly or privately).
What I saw little evidence of was what should be the common reaction: encouraging and participating in a careful assessment of the situation in hopes of identifying all of the possible causes and rationally responding to them. This would entail self-reflection and assumption-checking. For instance, how many proponents of the budget asked themselves what role they played in the defeat and what they could have done differently?
As with most complex social events, there are likely multiple underlying causes for the rejection of the budgets. A few possibilities:
The budgets simply diverged too much from what the majority of voters thought was appropriate and/or wanted to pay, especially given the causallyunrelated but personally relevant property reassessments;
Some voters didn’t fully grasp the issues and the consequences either of voting “yes” or “no”;
One or more parties propagated misinformation that inflamed people on one or both sides of the debate;
The rhetorical strategies of the proponents may have led to a “boomerang” effect that increased opposition. For instance, casting the debate in terms of simple dichotomies (e.g., pro vs. anti education, parent vs. senior, good vs. evil, etc.) was not helpful. People can be very “pro” education even if they thought the proposed budgets were too high.A vote against a budget is not a vote against the schools but an objection to a specific dollar amount and/or plan.(As an analogy, one may support the re-introduction of tolls on CT highways and rebuilding of our infrastructure with the new revenues while being opposed to any particular implementation plan.) Similarly, overt politicization and demonization of the “other” side likely served to harden positions and energize the opposition.
Redding has excellent (though not perfect) schools, as publicly argued by our school administration and school board leaders. Let’s do everything that we can afford to do to protect and strengthen them. But please, let’s be civil and put the common good above individual feelings. Let’s exhibit productive coping strategies that respect each other and focus on the problems and their solutions, and refrain from personal attacks. Let’s be kind to our elected officials and respectful at our public meetings.
A personal note on the role of the political parties in the budget debate: I personally do not believe that the Democratic Town Committee (DTC) should take a stand on the budget. Democrats have been unwavering supporters of education at all levels, but have been and continue to be divided on the budget, and this is a reason the DTC has not voted on taking a public position on the budget in probably a dozen or more years.

Changes necessary to Help Shift Our Imperiled Planet Onto a Sustainable Path
January 8, 2019
Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
In a previous article, “What is the Main Cause of Climate Change” (http://jewcology.org/2019/01/capitalism-is-leading-the-world-to-a-climate-catastrophe/), I argued that capitalism’s need for continued growth and maximization of profits, with environmental considerations a secondary consideration, is leading the world toward a climate catastrophe. That we are on a very perilous path is indicated by the increasingly dire reports of climate experts and academies and by the increasing frequency and severity of heat waves, droughts, wildfires, storms, and ...

Speaker: David Krantz From pickle makers to bicyclists to farmers to environmental-policy wonks to Yiddishists, learn more about the nascent Jewish-environmental movement. What initiatives are working in the field? Where are they? What are their strengths and challenges? And how can you become involved? The Limmud Festival 2018 (December 22 - 27 in Birmingham, UK) is one of the biggest celebrations of Jewish learning and culture in the world.

Eco-Zionism, Diaspora politics and Israel’s shadow government: how you can make a difference

Speaker: David Krantz Discover the shadow government that most Israelis don’t even know about. And learn how you can have an impact in Israel beyond donations and advocacy. Herzl’s vision for Israel may be different than you think. The Limmud Festival 2018 (December 22 - 27 in Birmingham, UK) is one of the biggest celebrations of Jewish learning and culture in the world. David Krantz leads Aytzim (Jewcology, Green Zionist Alliance, EcoJews, and Rabbis and Cantors for the Earth) and serves on the boards of the American Zionist Movement and Interfaith ...

Climate Change: An Existential Threat to the U.S., Israel, and the World
December 17, 2018
Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
The greatest threat to humanity today is climate change. The world is on a path that could lead to an uninhabitable world by the end of the century unless major changes soon occur. And it might happen much sooner because of self-reinforcing positive feedback loops (vicious cycles) that could result in an irreversible tipping point when climate change spins out of control. An outrageous exaggeration, like those in the past that predicted an end to the world? Not according to science academies worldwide, 97% of climate scientists, and virtually all peer-reviewed papers on ...

Why Jews Should Vote for Democrats in 2018
October 24, 2018
1 comment
Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
The U.S. mid-term elections could greatly influence the future of the U.S., Israel, and, indeed, the entire world. While it is often said that “elections have consequences,” and every national election is touted as extremely important, in efforts to increase voting, there are reasons why the upcoming election is really especially important, a potential game changer. Why? The Republicans currently hold the presidency, both houses of Congress and the Supreme Court. They have been doing everything they can to retain that power through gerrymandering ...

Working Together: Will a Single Plan Ameliorate Climate Disruption? Earth Etude for Elul 23
September 2, 2018
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
by Andy Oram~ Climate disruption is a universal scourge that requires a coordinated worldwide response. As such, it is a constant frustration to activists who wish that institutions everywhere could collaborate on implementing the Paris accords and to do even more. We often lament that governments and companies go their own ways, violating their own promises to hold back carbon production. Why can't humanity learn to work together in its own interest? Recourse to Jewish traditional texts can help us accept this situation. In particular, the story of the ...

Earth Etude for Elul 10 – People’s Climate March 2017
August 20, 2018
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
by Thea Iberall~ I bought my bus ticket a month early because I knew I had to go to the second People’s Climate March. I remember the day the first one occurred. I was giving a workshop in California on ‘what’s your carbon footprint?’ I was telling my audience how we all have to stop living as if we had two or three planets at our disposal. Deep down, I wanted to be at the march. This time I am, in Washington, DC. The motto of the march seems to be, ‘For everything to change, we need everyone.’ But not everyone I know is onboard: some people are more ...

Susan Levine
Member since 2014
In Washington D.C., youth will march on the National Mall to advocate for their own rights to a safe and livable future. We will rally and highlight the voices and stories of youth on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Then, we will flood the streets as a demonstration of youth power and show how #ThisIsZeroHour to act on climate change. There will also be a Youth Climate Weekend with a Youth Climate Lobby Day on Thursday, July 19 and Art Builds and Community Building on Friday, July 20. To learn more and register for the events: http://thisiszeroh...

The Youth Climate Weekend – Thursday, July 19 – Saturday, July 21
July 10, 2018
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
WE LOBBY - JULY 19 Zero Hour is not mobilizing just for the sake of mobilizing. We, the youth, are demanding an end to business as usual on climate change, so we have created science-backed demands for both our leaders, and the general public to take action on. On July 19th youth are taking over Capitol Hill to deliver our demands to our politicians. We are giving them the exact asks that we are marching for—so they have no excuse not to take action. ART BUILDS & COMMUNITY BUILDING - JULY 20 We will prepare for our mobilization by having art builds around the DC ...

Rainbow Day is on Shabbat Behar in 2018, May 11-12!
April 25, 2018
Rabbi David Seidenberg
Member since 2010
Celebrate Rainbow Day and the Rainbow Covenant with all Life! The first covenant in the Torah, when Noah leaves the ark, is a covenant with all creatures, and a covenant with the Earth itself, not just with humanity. There are so many ways you can teach about this covenant, the rainbow covenant, on the day it was established! What is Rainbow Day? On the 27th day of the second month, Noah, his family, and all the animals that were with them left the ark (Genesis 8). Exactly one lunar year and ten days before—one complete solar year—the flood began on the ...

Starting a Major Campaign to Help Heal Our Imperiled Planet
February 6, 2018
Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
Shalom, It is time for a major effort for committed Jews, preferably joining with others, to apply Jewish values to help heal our imperiled planet. Here are some issues to be considered: The world is rapidly heading toward a climate catastrophe. Many climate experts think we are close to an irreversible tipping point when climate change will spin out of control, with disastrous consequences, unless very significant positive changes soon occur. My article: “Climate Change: An Existential Threat to Israel, the US, and the World,” published in the Jerusalem Post ...

Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
by Richard Schwartz ~ It is hoped that the questions below will be helpful to people leading Tu Bishvat seders as a way to increase audience participation.

Please Help in this Important Effort That Can Avert a Climate Catastrophe and Help Shift Our Imperiled Planet Onto a Sustainable Path
January 14, 2018
Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
There is increasing evidence that the world is rapidly heading toward a climate catastrophe. An exaggeration? Please consider: 2017 was the third warmest year since temperature records were kept in 1880 and this follows three consecutive years of worldwide temperature records, In 2017 there were three category 3 or 4 hurricanes, three extreme wildfires in California, followed by a major mudslide there,and other severe climate events in many of the world’s areas. Climate experts are predicting even more severe climate events as temperatures keep rising. Points that ...

Proposal for an Interfaith Conference on Climate Change in Jerusalem
January 10, 2018
Richard Schwartz
Member since 2011
Proposal for Interfaith Conference on Climate Change in Jerusalem Need Statement For decades, conflict and turmoil in the Middle East have gripped the world and made the region an epicenter of international focus and concern. At this time, some wonder whether Jerusalem can be a source of anything but violence and hatred fueled by religious extremists. In this region’s persistent unrest, many attempts have been made to bring the two sides together. Most of the attempts focus on the differences between the sides and work toward resolving these differences. Yet the ...

My Green New Year’s Resolutions
December 29, 2017
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
I want to be "greener" this year and here are my plans: Resolution #1: Reduce. I am going to buy less — especially those things that have a negative impact on the environment, such as plastic tableware when I have company coming for dinner. I am also going to reduce my energy needs. I am going to wear more layers of clothing at home this winter, for example, so I can lower my thermostat without feeling cold. Resolution #2: Reuse. When we go out to eat, I am going to try to bring my own containers to take home the leftovers. Styrofoam can take hundreds of ...

Our 2017 (5777) Collection of Earth Etudes for Elul
September 20, 2017
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
Introduction by Susan Levine~ Elul is the month before Rosh Hashanah, a time when we review our lives and think about how we will live the coming year. And during Elul this year, we have seen three category 4 hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, and Maria) wreak havoc in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and several other Caribbean islands. The scientists have blamed increased ocean temperatures for the high winds and rising floodwaters. What other evidence do we need to believe that climate change is real? Our earth etudes actually connect our earth with the spirit of Judaism--Tikkun ...

Earth Etude for Elul 27 – Re-Connecting to the Land
September 17, 2017
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
by Rabbi Lawrence Troster ~On a recent vacation to my home town of Toronto, as I drove around the countryside and saw the many places I knew so well from my childhood, I reflected again on how the landscape in which I lived affected who I am and how I see the world. I was born in Toronto which is in an area that was covered by glaciers over 10,000 years ago and the land still is shaped by that ancient event: spoon shaped hills called drumlins, ridges called eskers which are the remains of the river beds that flowed from the retreating ice. And lakes: I spent many of ...

Earth Etude for Elul 24 – Water Down the Wall
September 14, 2017
Susan Levine
Member since 2014
by Carol Reiman~ from www.thinkcds.org/category/policy/ Borne on the water that etches the rock (of tablets and of temples), the breath of life glistens as it falls down and down and down the wall, pooling below, in blue green deep, a balm for bathers, to wash away the ash of grief and tired day; turning on, the waters pass slowly here, clotted by the blood of battle, iron arms lapped in reeds-- land of dust and stone sealed off to some-- left in pieces, separated parts. Eicha...

Fire Door Inspections
Midwest Firestop, Inc. now has certified fire door inspectors to help you meet the NFPA 101 and NFPA 80 requirements.
NFPA 101 Life Safety Code, has required the annual inspection of fire rated openings and certain egress openings since the 2009 edition. NFPA 80, the Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives, has required the annual inspection of fire rated openings since the 2007 edition.
Recently the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS) issued a memorandum stating that starting Jan 1, 2018 full compliance is required.
CMS Memorandum Summary
CMS Memorandum Summary.
In health care occupancies, non-rated doors assemblies including corridor doors to patient care rooms and smoke barrier doors are not subject to the annual inspection and testing requirements of either NFPA 80 or NFPA 105.
Non-rated doors should be routinely inspected as part of the facility maintenance program.
Full compliance with the annual fire door assembly inspection and testing in accordance with 2010 NFPA 80 is required by January 1, 2018.
Life Safety Code (LSC) deficiencies associated with the annual inspection and testing of fire doors should be cited under K211 – Means of Egress - General.

MillerCoors Says Trump's Aluminum Tariff Will Kill Jobs 'Across the Beer Industry'
MillerCoors Says Trump's Aluminum Tariff Will Kill Jobs 'Across the Beer Industry'
By Sarah Gray
Updated: March 1, 2018 10:23 PM ET | Originally published: March 2, 2018
MillerCoors, the second largest U.S. brewing company, spoke out against President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum in a tweeted statement Thursday. The President has said he will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move that could heighten trade tensions with China and other countries.
The beer company, which produces beers including Coors Light, Miller Lite and Blue Moon and uses aluminum for its cans, called the tariffs “misguided.” According to MillerCoors, the tariffs could lead to “job losses across the beer industry” and that “American workers and American consumers will suffer.”
MillerCoors statement: We are disappointed with President Trump’s announcement of a 10% tariff on aluminum. While we won’t know the details for a week, the Department of Defense recently reported that aluminum does not cause any national security issues. (1/3)
— MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018
Like most brewers, we are selling an increasing amount of our beers in aluminum cans, and this action will cause aluminum prices to rise. It is likely to lead to job losses across the beer industry. (2/3)
— MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018
We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available, however, there simply isn’t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us. American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of
this misguided tariff. (3/3)
— MillerCoors (@MillerCoors) March 1, 2018
Trump will reportedly sign the new trade measure next week, which will put a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.
Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018
The announced tariffs follow a Commerce Department report which found that importing metal weakens national security, because it hurts American industry. The announcement had been pushed off as factions within the administration who are divided on trade worked out the scope of the measure.
Those politically in favor of the tariffs say U.S. industries have been hurt by cheap foreign metals. However, there are fears that tariffs could hurt U.S. security as well as the economy. If the tariffs are implemented across the board, they’ll end up impacting allies, who may retaliate. For instance, similar tariffs imposed by President George W. Bush’s administration led to a confrontation with the European Union.
Industry is equally divided. U.S. steel and aluminum manufacturers have been pushing for stricter tariffs to help bolster the sagging industry. Yet, companies that rely on making products out of steel and aluminum — like beer companies — say that imposing tariffs will raise prices for consumers or cause layoffs.
The stock market reacted negatively to the tariff announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing more than 400 points lower, on Thursday. Companies in industries that use steel and aluminum, like Ford, General Motors and Boeing, saw their shares drop. Bucking the trend, Molson Coors Brewing (which owns MillerCoors) and U.S. beer giant Anheuser-Busch saw modest gains.
Pete Coors, chairman of the board for Molson Coors and great-grandson of beer entrepreneur Adolph Coors, ran for Senate on the Republican ticket in 2004. After donating to former Gov. Chris Christie’s failed 2016 campaign, Coors held a fundraiser for then-candidate Donald Trump.
MillerCoors has not responded to requests for further comment on its statement. MONEY has also reached out to Anheuser-Busch, the largest American brewery, to see if it will be similarly impacted by the tariff, but the company has not responded.

Wednesday, December 16, 2015; NORTHAMPTON COUNTY, N.C. —;Leaders in the small North Carolina town of Woodland rejected a new solar farm after residents expressed concerns that it would “suck up all the energy from the sun.”
The Roanoke-Chowan News Herald reports the Woodland Town Council denied approval of the solar farm and put a moratorium on others after citizens expressed distrust and fear of the solar panels.
One resident, a retired Northampton County science teacher, reportedly said she was concerned that photosynthesis would not happen after she said she observed areas near solar panels where plants were brown and dead because they did not get enough sunlight.
Another resident reportedly questioned the high number of cancer deaths in the area, saying no one could tell her that solar panels didnt cause cancer.

World News - Sarah Sands: While we argue over Iraq, we are losing Afghanistan
The face of General Sir Mike Jackson is part biblical, part game reserve, and one does not take criticism from him lightly. So when he chided me just before his Dimbleby lecture last week for "ambushing" his successor, General Sir Richard Dannatt, in an interview, I shifted uncomfortably. Then I protested: "It needed to be said." "In private," Jackson replied. In a BBC2 documentary about the implications of the Dannatt interview, the constitutionalists were out in force. Nobody disputed the General's account of facts on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan or his right to advise the Government. His sin was to let the public know the truth....

Fierce battle erupts in east Chad
Heavy fighting has taken place between Chad's government troops and rebels in the east of the country. Both sides claimed victory in the clash, which reportedly began when three army columns attacked a rebel hideout near the town of Biltine. Unconfirmed reports say hundreds of men were wounded or killed in the battle that lasted several hours. Rebels launched a campaign earlier this year aimed at overthrowing Chad's President, Idriss Deby. Saturday's battle between rebels and government troops was extremely fierce, with many reportedly dead and wounded on both sides, says the BBC's Stephanie Hancock in Chad's capital, N'Djamena. Dozens of wounded soldiers were taken to the main eastern city of Abeche, where scenes at the local hospital were described by aid workers as carnage, our correspondent says. ...

Giant tent to be built in Astana
Kazakhstan has unveiled a new architectural project for its capital Astana - a giant transparent tent that will contain an indoor city. The 150m-high (500ft) dome, designed by UK architect Norman Foster, will be built in just over a year. The tent is being made from special material that absorbs sunlight to create the effect of summer inside. Astana lies in the very heart of the Central Asian steppe. Temperatures there often drop to -30C in the winter. The final shape of the world's biggest tent was revealed in a 3D model by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Underneath, in an area larger than 10 football stadiums, will be a city with squares and cobbled streets, canals, shopping centres and golf courses. The idea is to recreate summer, so that when the outside temperature is -30C, the residents of the Kazakh capital can play outdoor tennis, take boat rides or sip coffee on the pavement cafes. ...

U.S. May Soon Seek Iran Sanctions Vote
The U.S. and its closest Western allies may soon call a vote on U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iran, even at the risk that Russia and China may abstain or veto the measures, officials said Sunday. "They're talking about a vote as soon as possible," a U.S. official said of plans by the Americans, French and British. He and other diplomats and representatives of Western governments spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to divulge Western strategies on Iran. The decision to risk a Russian and Chinese veto would reflect recognition by the five permanent Security Council members that they cannot agree on a common approach to dealing with concerns that Iran might be seeking to develop nuclear arms. ...

Bill: Murderer's Remains Out Of Arlington. I hope this applies to all the Politicians and Bush who have caused so many deaths. But somehow I think they made themselves exempt.
Congress has approved a $3.2 billion veterans bill that includes a provision ordering the removal of a convicted double murderer's remains from Arlington National Cemetery. News of the bill's passage was welcomed by Vernon Davis, whose elderly parents, Daniel and Wilda Davis, were fatally stabbed by Russell Wayne Wagner at their Hagerstown home on Valentine's Day 1994. Davis fought for 16 months to have Wagner's remains removed from the military cemetery. "Right to this day, I just can't believe it," Davis told The (Hagerstown) Herald-Mail for a story in Sunday's editions. "I didn't think it would ever happen." Wagner, a Vietnam veteran, was sentenced in 2002 to life in prison. He died of a heroin overdose in 2005, and his body was cremated. At the request of his sister, Karen Anderson, Wagner's ashes were placed at Arlington National Cemetery. ...

One of the great things about this place is that it has remarkably honest people, and respect.
To go down the path of dishonesty will just make this site a cheep false empty place like so many others.
Diversity often means bending to the lowest level, as the lowest level cannot rise to a higher level, we all know another site that tried this and what happened.

I think that the quality of posts & threads is one of the most important things. (For retaining members)
Interesting topics, well researched and well presented, with intelligent comment and debate.
Minimal "nonsense", childish, one-liner, smart arse comments, personal attacks, sniping, etc
And No Spam!
We do quite well at that already I think.
What we're maybe not doing so well is attracting brand new members.
How do new members find us in the first place?
You won't ever see our FB page unless you search for it or someone recommends it to you...
Word of Mouth?
Adverts?
All of us dropping specific links in our own social media feeds (if we have them)?
I wish I knew.

I would like to believe we're a website that will be a fair place to come when all the current madness
dies down and decent discourse will be sought.
The idea that two opposing opinions can have equal merit and be honourable in their positions, is regularly
maintained here without the need for name-calling. Granted, the earlier US election brought emotions based
on 'I-just-don't-like-him/her' perceptions, but in my view, political arenas have become nothing more than
'game-show' free-for-alls with subtly abusive pithy rhetoric.
Like Gordi suggested, we tend not to be the place for the one-liners of insult and at the moment, maybe
we're not sexy enough!
And again, quality for posts with members engaged in polite, noble discussion is paramount for those still
out there who wish to find a place away from the squabbling egoists.
P.S By the way, the baiting media doesn't help!

@Wallfire , @gordi , @BIAD and Grace.
You all make Sense and I think you're all correct.
How do we get recognized?
Word of Mouth and Links through Social Media, I also think a Youtube listing with a member or two or three discussing threads.

Well, Youtube videos are great and can be very informative (and entertaining) if done correctly.
But, like FB... if you don't search for us specifically, (...and even if you DO!) it'll automatically direct you to what IT wants you to see.
Even when I use exact (and correct) search terms for videos that I KNOW are listed, I often get "misdirected" to similarly named videos or "popular" videos that have similar general subject matter.
I suspect that it's all payment (or ad) driven?
e.g. search for "Rogue Nation" on youtube and the first 100+ videos suggested for you are ALL about the movie "Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation" even though you didn't use "Mission Impossible" in the search terms!
I LIKE the idea of RN videos.... but the same problem crops up.... HOW do we get potential new members to even find them??

Running a website has never been, and never will be, an easy task. Looking from the outside, it does seem easy peasy but the time needed to do so is paramount.
Unfortunately, the same applies for having it found and looked at.
No matter the venue to have RN out there, it takes time and an enormous commitment. We would all enjoy having youtube videos out there, radio shows out there, social medias out there but again, the ones going through the hoops know this: It takes time and not all have as much time on their hands as they'd wish to.
One great point has been made within this thread, we are not visible unless someone enters the right words. And even then, as Gordi mentioned, run Rogue Nation through search engines and it becomes a Mission Impossible galore.
Attracting new members is extremely difficult, keeping them as well. Rogue Nation has diversity, from different continents, which allows exciting point of views. Personally, I think that the approach has to be made on a personal basis. Members asking people if they'd be interested in looking at a website that stands different from the others, as per their ways of respectfully communicating.
When RN started, some of us would do so through the site that shall not be named until the pms became no longer private and hammers started falling on us, post banned or totally banned being the result. But it did work, for a while.
Then again, some of those members have left. It is tough to go from a website where you post a thread or a reply and get an reply within minutes to here, where you get a reply within hours or even days sometimes.
To keep a momentum of threads and comments going, we need people that again, do have a lot of time on their hands. Not everyone's case.
It's a vicious circle. For many of us, life happens. Be it illness, sick or hurt, work, personal life, time becomes limited and no one should be held accountable for that. Life happens.
So what is the solution?
Your guess is as good as mine. But I do believe that we should go back to basics; personal invites.

Explanation: THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH RN3 OK!
Personal Disclosure: Trust me on this ok ... we have the go very slow and try things and if they work thats great but if they don't we ..well we go very slow and steam ahead anyway.
Sure and steady wins this race.
If you want to add something to RN3 then that is fine ..we always accept enhanced services and products here BUT to expect others to do this for oneself is poor form IMO and one should maybe try get some training and DIY! I for one go very slow ... and we have been in this mode since we left hernandos hideaway and this mode works for us.
If you want more people then please recruit them.
If you want more exposure then please advertise to your social media outlet.
If you just want to bitch and complain then that is also ok...but Id prefer it in the rants section of the forum ok!
RN3 has every possible outlet anybody could ever want and its doing perfectly fine in my books.
If people want to change others minds on certain matters then I recommend they try using a hammer as its more effective than mere words alone. We do this with the ban hammer on spam bots ..and guess what..they don't come back much.
I'm sorry that I'm not sorry that I see this more as a rant than as a suggestion!
Please continue to use RN3 to yours/its fullest capabilities ok and shine on you crazy diamonds!

@guohua
Explanation: We are on google ok ... just have to use the exact search terms or you get directed elsewhere by the google AI bot.
The hyphen and the number 3 are REQUIRED TERMS to be search for if one wants to find us on the web.
Personal Disclosure: Word of mouth tends to be the best way to evolve anything peoplewise and it boils down to each of us on how we feel about RN3 and whether it needs any more people posting. If we want a more faster way of communicating then I suggest everybody sign up to Discord app and I will make a room for RN3 to exist there ok.
That is all!

Hi OL,
Not sure if you were replying to me.
If so, all I'm saying is that personal contact is the best way to go, in my opinion.
Sorry if the rest of it sounded a bit like a rant as it wasn't the way I wanted it to be perceived as. I was simply stating that time is an issue for many, yes, myself included. And I am sure that I am not the only one having this issue.
All of us here, have disappeared from sight for a while, some longer than others, but we've always been back at some point or another. There's nothing wrong with RN, it's quite the contrary. RN is made up of wonderful people and a certain bonds remain - whether one is here or not, at any point in time. That is a strength that is fairly non existent elsewhere.
Hope this clarifies my previous post.
Respectfully,
Sol.

Oh hell no.
You should see what it look like here. I should take a picture actually. Ice storms and snow storms make for fun on the roads...

No-no, I'm a Brit and weather is a paramount subject in a discussion!
But I agree with you, this site may not have all the bells and whistles of an out-and-out brawl
website, but I'm certain that when all the sh*t-flicking calms down elsewhere, places like RN
will be areas people will come for decent discourse.
We do strive to look at all the angles and call any dubious information out without insulting the

Explanation: We are on google ok ... just have to use the exact search terms or you get directed elsewhere by the google AI bot.
The hyphen and the number 3 are REQUIRED TERMS to be search for if one wants to find us on the web.
Personal Disclosure: Word of mouth tends to be the best way to evolve anything peoplewise and it boils down to each of us on how we feel about RN3 and whether it needs any more people posting. If we want a more faster way of communicating then I suggest everybody sign up to Discord app and I will make a room for RN3 to exist there ok.
That is all!
With that being said, I need to find time and start posting to Google+ again......those threads usually appear in Google search
(gee, I wonder why....lol)
Anyhow, I am hoping I can spend a little more time on here if not just for posting threads to Google+
My hours are odd now, whereas before I had the first part of the week off then worked the weekends when we traveled.
And with the holidays over (some weeks I put in over 65 hrs) , I should be able to sneak on here for a wee bit.
No promises, but I will try.
Yeah, word of mouth seems to be one of the best ways to recruit.

I'm sure I've posted some Hangar 1 videos here in the past, but they are probably buried too deep for people to get to them now.
I was watching these last night and they have some really good ones from the military and credible people as witnesses.
Hope you enjoy, and if you would like to discuss anything in any of them, please do.

This was a good video,
I do believe the History Channel made an effort to open peoples minds to the existence of Aliens.
I'm very surprised that our Conspiracy site doesn't get more attention, we do post some really good stuff that most people out there haven't ever seen.

@guohua, Yes, we do. And if they don't see anything here in the forums they like, they can always go to the file I made at the bottom of the forums. I don't think I left out much of anything in it; the one about "Alien Interference", I think it was called.
Maybe people are just to shy to come on. People are still afraid of being ridiculed for certain things. SMH.

Its true that the members here are open minded and things wrote here are intelligent and thought provoking. I have looked at many other sites and cant stand the " Little green men had sex with my great great granny and im a alien hybred who has greater knowledge that every else" types

...By the way, did I tell you that little green men had sex with my great great granny and I'm an alien-hybrid?
For another time, perhaps.
.............................
I've always been fascinated with the Ufo subject, but there's far-too much disjointed information out there.
Growing up in the sixties and seventies, the multitude of exotic species that were alleged to have visited
Earth reminded me of the Doctor Who series with a different-looking alien every week!
Today, and after the attempted garrisoning of the types down to the non-distinct, all-the-same Grey Alien,
we're back to individual selections. Blue birds, Lizard-Men and the eternal Mantis are still on the go with
the odd Nordic thrown in for posterity.
Nuclear war is only occasionally mentioned by the spacemen and it seems that the once-sexy breeding
program is coming to an end too. Maybe some were voted off the Galactic Federation Committee and the
agenda has changed.
But what ever it is next for those crazy flying-saucer folk, I'll wager it involves a seminar and purchasing
of a book to find out.
.............................
Seriously, it is difficult. When Kenneth Arnold's description of the nine objects he saw near Mount Rainier
was misinterpreted by the media into seeing flying saucers instead of crescent-shaped objects, the world
began to see flying saucers.
As far as the Powers-That-Be are concerned, I think they're making headway in the various fields of
technology that these vehicles involve themselves in, but it's the adjustment in understanding the
realities that's causing them problems.
And I still stand by my statement that anal-probing is just plain wrong.

Just a curious question... Putting the ET/Alien topic aside, have you ever bought a book on a topic that you wished to learn more about?
Have you ever attended a seminar to learn more on a subject of your personal interest?
I see choosing to pay to go to college for a course in something of interest being no different than paying to go to a seminar for the same reason.
I've paid to go to several seminars, but it had nothing to do with little green men, just something of interest to me. I've also paid to study a subject in college for just one course because it was of interest to me.
I've also bought many books by authors on topics I like.
So, please tell me how selling books or attending a seminar by someone in the UFO/ET field is thought to mean that person is a fraud and only in it to sell books and make money?
Everyone has to make a living, no matter what field they choose. Some people just love the fringe topics and choose to do what they love, rather than go to a job they hate everyday.
As for the anal-probing, to each his own.

I'm sorry Mystic, the 'crazy flying-saucer folk' I mentioned was actually aimed at the occupants of the craft!
My cynicism comes from the length of time this phenomena has endured without any solid evidence that the
world can agree on. The ufo subject is taken tongue-in-cheek in the high street and it seems that the many
conferences never seem to gel with each witnesses accounts.
How many retired military with top-secret clearance who frequent these seminars have said they recognise
each other from their service days...? Surely a chain of acquaintance would surface at some point.
I'm not poo-pooing the ufo subject, it's just some of the bell-ringers I have serious doubts on.
Sooo, to make it up to you, here's Colin Andrews from last year discussing crop circles.
(In my humble opinion, I think he's near it when he mentions 'consciousness')

Maybe that's because there are hundreds of different species visiting us, and each one has a different agenda?

Well, off the top of my head, I can say that William Tompkins had people who remembered him.
And, although some might not have run into each other, they were stationed at the same base and knew some of the same people there. Funny how that happens with regular people too.

No problem. I have my own doubts about some of them too.

Here's something you don't see every day... the INSIDE of a space craft. I guess the person who was abducted refused to go without her phone. Not saying I believe this, but it's good for entertainment, right?

@BIAD&MW Like so many other things in this life, there are people why care and want to give the best information they can about UFOs, and there are other people who just want to seem important and make money by twisting all the facts to suit what they want.
Thats why I read very very carefully and try to find the truth, its the people who want fame and money who do the most harm to the truth.

As Mueller investigation heats up, Trump unleashes barrage of tweets attacking investigators
| Friday, December 07, 2018
According to Politico , Donald Trump is reportedly blaming Robert Mueller for his low approval rating. It's been hovering in the mostly in upper 40's for the past few months. Mueller's team is also expected to file a memo Friday with recommendations for sentencing former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who recently pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. [Full Article...]

All Hail Starbrillian, King of Porn
Any thoughtful pornoholic has positively at least heard of the tube spot known as xHamster.com. Most of you, I’m game to wager, birth fapped to it on more than person occasion. the some of you, it power rhythmical be your go-to porn tube site. And, if that is the cause , you are certainly not alone. In act , there are 10 million others who fap to xHamster time ample to be registered users. After Xvideos and Porn Nave , it is the third most lay blue place on the internet today. Headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus, xHamster was founded in 2007 before Alex Hawkings. The minds behind the milieu wanted to do something unusual from what they were seeing most porno sites doing at the time. Coming elsewhere of the apex repute of common media sites like Facebook and Snigger , xHamsters founders plonk down loose to into being a instal that was of parts porn tube and xxx communal media site. A spokesperson the the put said of xHamster’s intentions that the install was meant for people who wanted to witter , return pornographic pics and share unpaid videos ... to awaken reciprocated friends online and dialect ferret partners interested in personal relationships." I of it is kirmess to affirm that x Hamster has done a bang-up tier of providing the line that they thicken view to one , as it has suit a cornucopia of bungler and homemade user-uploaded content. As distance as the “ out partners interested in companion relationships” vicinage is solicitous , spite , I cannot support to. I suffer with no circumstances felt the necessary to visit to a porn spot to up with my “ detailed relationships,” but I am sheerest bizarre to be versed if anyone’s day had any fortunes with that mien of the site. The People’s Porn Network Along with so much user-uploaded pleased , notwithstanding , confrontation is fastened to as a be revealed sooner or later. With the several of people from there in the crowd who are stricken fucks—not feeling fucks who through all daytime fapping in their mothers’ basements the disposition you are a heartsick fuck, I’m talking genuine , clinically not around fucks—a plat like xHamster that allows its users to upload basically whatever they longing was compelled to for inundated with illicit and fucked up content. xHamster has not struggled in keeping up with the shifting public tides and establishing a sensation of proper calling , though. In April of 2016, for benchmark , North Carolina enacted laws that said its counties and cities were allowed to forthrightly for against members of the LGBT community.

To avoid action the growing ridge of carrying-off taste in America, xHamster banned all videos involving spoliate , including those which featured the fucking of blind partners.

You can also conveniently eliminate the videos so that you not look at vertical , gay, or shemale videos. If you don’t differentiate at all in your hedonism, to whatever , you can ever on all three.

That concerned watermark "this video has been uploaded to xHamster" appears on the chick's one like a motherfucking cockblocker! Earnestly , whoever vision it was a champion guess deserves a rebound in the balls! As definitely as xHamster’s public media components are worried , you demand all the regular community-oriented features that you’d be use to on other nearly sites (such as Porn Heart )—you can commentary on/rate videos, sum videos to your favorites, upload videos/pictures, and statement users directly.

Domestic Violence Allegations Against Redskins Player Take A Dark Turn

Reuben Foster’s ex-girlfriend Elissa Ennis is claiming she lied when she recanted claims he beat her in early 2018.
Foster was arrested in late November after allegedly striking Ennis at a hotel in Tampa prior to a game for the San Francisco 49ers. He was released and picked up by the Redskins shortly afterwards. Now, Ennis’ is claiming her previous claims of domestic violence were true, despite the fact she recanted. (RELATED: The NFL Has Stopped Player Accused Of Domestic Violence From Taking The Field For The Redskins)
ESPN wrote the following on her Thursday “GMA” appearance and the situation:
Ennis accused Foster of assaulting her in the February incident, but those charges were dropped in May when she recanted her allegations. She told GMA she lied when she recanted, saying she did so out of love.
“Love will have you doing things that’s not in your best interests,” she said, adding, “I did what I had to do for the person I love. I thought that he would change.”
…
The Redskins have said they did their own investigation into the allegations against Foster. Team president Bruce Allen said earlier this week that the Redskins had “heard a side of the story that is different.”
Obviously, this isn’t a great situation for anybody involved. Ennis claimed he beat he before, walked the claim back, claimed he beat her again and is now claiming the original claim was also true. It’s a disaster of a situation to know what is and isn’t true.
The NFL has to be so upset that this story continues to stay in the news.

The reality here is that there is no good outcome at all. Foster won’t be taking the field anytime soon for the Redskins because he’s on the commissioner’s exempt list, but that won’t stop people from constantly talking about him.
You have to sit back and wonder if the Redskins are regretting the decision to claim Foster off of waivers. It’s just a PR nightmare. Something tells me they might do things a bit differently if they could go back in time.

Climate convulsion signals ominous prospect
Nilratan Halder | Published: August 09, 2018 22:12:19
With Europe smarting under a heat wave -parts of it extending from Spain to arctic Sweden under the sway of record high temperature -it is clear that the planet is in convulsion. Bangladesh and its neighbours in South Asia have been experiencing tolerable temperature because the monsoon has been more generous this time unlike last year to send moderate to heavy rains. The United States of America has failed to contain one of the worst wildfires in California in its history. Extreme heat has forced more air-conditioning there leading to demand for more electricity than supplied. Under sweltering heat in Japan, 30 people were reported dead. Similar reports come from parts of China as well.
Yet all these have not been as bewildering as the 50 or so wildfires that broke out in Sweden on account of rising temperature. Lack of rains for months have turned its forests including those in arctic areas into tinderboxes. Withering heat has also caught Canada off guard as it took a heavy toll on its citizens in Montreal. Dozens of people died of extreme heat so much so that the bodies of the victims swamped the city's morgues and had to be stored elsewhere.
News from the traditional Earth's cauldron like the Sahara desert is not inspiring at all. A weather station in Algeria recorded the highest temperature, 51.30C, ever recorded. If Spain and Portugal are bracing for record high temperature (47-480 C), France and Germany also find themselves on the receiving end. France had to close down four nuclear reactors at three power plants and Sweden also followed suit by shutting down one of two reactors at a power plant. What about a reverse pattern of weather where traditional tropical areas like Asia become cooler and Europe and other cold areas hotter!
If the onslaught of heat waves in Sweden is not totally unprecedented, Stockholm records the highest ever temperature by 20 C in 261years. But in other parts of Europe also, there is a precedent of a similar unusual temperature rise. Yet this latest temperature disruption is more or less global in nature rather than region-specific. What is becoming most alarming is that the temperature rise is not remaining confined to land areas but it is wreaking havoc with seas. Last year the Great Barrier Reef was severely affected by a similar sea warming. Also due to such warming vital ingredients like methane deposit in the ocean bed, scientists warns, can be disrupted triggering more and more hurricane and tsunamis.
The world in all likelihood is going to court disasters on account of man's own follies that are responsible for convoluting the planet. A recent study holds that keeping the global temperature below the agreed 20 C more than the pre-industrial level is no guarantee that the erratic pattern of temperature will not set in. The impact of the present level of temperature -supposing it does not increase any further due to emission of carbon dioxide -on many related areas such as ocean beds and what is called jet streams caused in isolated pockets may have domino effects.
This was not in the calculation of climate experts when the Paris climate deal was signed. Now here is a rude reality confronting the human civilisation. Political leaders like Donald Trump are yet to recognise the threat -no matter even if hurricanes, floods and wildfires with greater frequencies continue to destroy and damage lives and property in his own backyard. The negative influence the US President exerts on others harms the cause even more because the latter take cue from him and stop contributing to the climate fund. Ratifying the climate treaty is not enough, it has to be followed by genuine actions. It is quite heartening to know that the two most populous nations have shifted their focus from the fossil fuel to renewable energy. India has remarkably increased its investment in the alternative energy sources with the result that for the first time the allocation tips the balance in favour of clean energy.
Right at this moment, humanity finds itself at the crossroads of scientific and technological progress. There is no way of turning its back to science and technology. But how such wisdom has to be employed for securing the humanity's future is the most important question. Along with a paradigm shift in living standard which for some is unnecessary luxury that only stokes the fire of consumerism, there is a need for channelling resources for research and exploration of ways of and means to obtaining energy from renewable sources.
Common citizens the world over are not in favour of conflict and violence and dominance of other people; it is the political leaders who play war games and acquire deadly weapons. Armaments cost the largest proportion of resources and diverted these could be enough to transform the lives and livelihoods of people everywhere. Even if this sounds utopian, at least some portion of the weaponry expenditure could be diverted to find cheaper ways of generation of renewable energy. This would have done a great service to the mankind. But irrational political calculations stand in the way of making the world safe for the mankind.

Impressive Cyclopean Ruins at Alatri in Lazio Built About Three Centuries Before End of Ice Age Like Mycenae
July 31, 2018
Translate:
Italian archaeologists say that the amazing megalithic structures at Alatri east of Rome were built circa 1800 b. c. by the Pelasgians, the ruins which look much like those at Myceanae and Tiryns in Greece, also built in that timeframe, and the submerged “cyclopean” ruins in the Black Sea off Anapa, as well such structures reported submerged off Greece, because the Ice Age ended circa 1500 b. c. Although the Mycenaeans did speak the Greek language, they obviously had learned their building from the Pelasgians who dominated the region, and Italy, during the Ice Age.

Keelan: Requiem for democracy
TNR / June 19, 2018	
“The Four Freedoms” by illustrator Norman Rockwell were featured as covers for The Saturday Evening Post magazine in 1943.
By Don Keelan
Voter apathy was surely present on June 5, 2018, as evidenced by the recent turnout for the town of Bennington vote on changes to the town’s charter.
According to an article in the Bennington Banner by Jim Therrien, 608 voters came out to cast their vote either in favor of (440) or against (148) amending the town’s charter. To place the results in perspective, there are 9,166 registered voters in Bennington, and the turnout saw only 6.6 percent of them express an interest.
When there is such a poor showing by the residents of Bennington on an important town matter, it surely looks like democracy is getting close to being terminal.
The issue of voter apathy is not new and is something that has been occurring for some time, especially on annual town meeting day — not only in Bennington, but throughout Vermont. And there are other aspects that support the conclusion that apathy has tightened its grip.
Throughout Vermont, there are countless board seats pertaining to local government that are not being filled. There are planning boards, zoning boards, school boards and, in some cases, select boards that have empty chairs. This is in addition to almost zero public attendance at scheduled public meetings.
According to Therrien, the charter changes were both minor and substantive. The proposed changes were the product of a Charter Review Committee that had been working on changes and updates to the town’s charter since early last year. Aside from periodic amendments to the charter, it has been five decades since the charter was changed by the voters.
Bennington has the potential to be a prosperous and successful town — it is home to four colleges, a major hospital (largest employer in the county), numerous cultural and manufacturing organizations, a fairly large pre-K to 12th grade school population, and wealthy and not so wealthy residents. Not all of the changes to the charter would affect everyone in town, but judging from the turnout, most residents did not care.
The real takeaway from the June 5 experience is the message the adults of voting age send to the younger generation of their town. The lack of interest in the political process at the local, state and national level has been adopted by so many.
Can it be that we are too busy with our daily lives? Is there just too much political polarization, or is it that one feels that his or her voice won’t be heard, so why bother at all?
I believe that positive change might very well be on the horizon. It will initially come from a three week event that will take place in southern Vermont this summer when The Mill, a nonprofit entity in East Arlington, will be producing and sponsoring the Four Freedoms Festival. Ever since last year, Mountain Media LLC and The Mill Inc. have been working on bringing the festival to Vermont.
“The Four Freedoms” were the paintings developed by Norman Rockwell in 1942, inspired by President Franklin Roosevelt’s January 1941 speech “Freedom of Religion, Freedom from Want, Freedom from Fear, and Freedom of Speech.”
It might be helpful to many to hear the history of how Rockwell was inspired to do the painting Freedom of Speech. In 1942, he witnessed an Arlington farmer stand up at town meeting and voice his concerns over the town’s rebuilding the fire-destroyed high school. His was the only voice against the proposed project.
The town of Bennington, one of Vermont’s oldest and most historic places, deserves better than to have only 6 percent of its registered voters come out to vote. I hope that we are not ready to have the pallbearers of the casket of democracy be the lobbyists, bureaucrats and politicians.

“The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public’s money.”
I’m not sure who said this, Tocqueville or Alexander Tytler. But the gist applies here. Why bother voting?

These dismal voters numbers are showing the feeling of being left behind with the
legislation they see in Montpelier, not their values.
Bennington, you need to wake up Voice your opinion before it’s too late. We need
to get Vermont Back to Vermont, not the Big City policies these flatlanders in our
Capital need to go.

A true testament to the founding fathers belief that “We have given you a democratic republic, if you can keep it”. Apparently Bennington doesn’t understand this. The ones in power will make the rules. Your job has become to obey them.

Soulmate for Eternity to Pammy: Full Time Dad to Valerie and Sammy. Entrepreneur. Patriot.
“NO! I PREFER TO BE BROKE!” NOT INTERESTED in Creating Your Own Freedom and Liberty? Well then, enjoy your enslavement, enjoy living inside their system and keep listening to the same corrupt slave masters that created this and put your whole family in this broken, corrupt, rigged poverty and control system…
BREAKING: Total U.S. Household Debt SOARS to Record Above $13 TRILLION!
PEOPLE NEED CASH FLOW. Total US Household Debt Soars to Record Above THIRTEEN TRILLION DOLLARS – $13,000,000,000,000 – “T” TRILLION!
But people waltz around life like everything’s ok. Most families are quietly drowning in financial debt and stress – which affects most every other aspect of life.
Increase in rare cancers, diabetes, obesity, heart disease.
Increase in mental health issues and dependency on drugs.
Cultural polarization and hatred promoted and taught.
Political polarization and hatred taught from cradle to grave.
Low quality jobs. Over worked. Under paid. Stressed out.
Corruption. Economic Stagnation. Crime. Alienation.
Divided and Conquered. The indoctrination is constant from all media.
It’s not by accident. The system you live and barely survive under was designed to do exactly what it’s doing to you and your family. It’s “Slavery 2.0” and it’s vicious.
Slavery wasn’t “abolished.” It was simply upgraded and rebranded to include EVERYONE.
Wage slaves.
Citizen Cattle.
You’re not governed, ruled or led by your political system – you’re herded and harvested by it… like a crop or livestock.
But deep down inside, you already knew this.
Question is: are you serious about finding a solution?
The solution?
Focus on increasing the ways in which you create cash flow. Then focus on self education. Their “education” is cleverly designed indoctrination. People are institutionalized by it. They want you alienated and to feel like you’re all alone and dependent on them.
The “default” system doesn’t seem to be working good enough. Seek solutions outside that failing system.
We focus on education and bringing awareness. We also focus on building networks of like-minded people committed to teaching others. We’re solutions oriented and not just obsessed about the problems 24 hours a day. We’re positively doing things about it.
BAD NEWS: Click here to read the bad news.
Good News: Click here to meet a network of blue collar entrepreneurs that can help you build the skills, access the systems and tools and build the inner strength to change your life.
We are building lives of liberty and independence outside their failed, rigged, crumbling system. We start on the inside of their failed system and use their own rules to our advantage. We use their system for leverage and to raise awareness. We then plug our network of patriots into our own system and teach liberty, financial empowerment and interdependence.
Our ideas and systems aren’t perfect. They’re not designed to be perfect nor are they designed to be a “one-size-fits-all” solution, but for many, it’s a start. For many people, it’s working. And that’s all we can hope for. We strive to improve daily. That’s where you come in. We’re always looking for great people who can resonate with our message and our vision.
We need your help.
It’s about freedom.
It’s about relationships.
It’s about values and principles.
Click here and review everything if you’re interested in our vision and our cause.

Disney said it was no longer seeking a “Dia de los Muertos” trademark request because the film’s name will change before its release.
(laloalcaraz.com)
[THE SACRAMENTO BEE]
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — When Lalo Alcaraz learned this week that Disney was seeking to trademark “Dia de los Muertos,” the name of the traditional “Day of the Dead” celebrated by millions in Mexico and the U.S., the cartoonist had an idea.
The trademark was for an animated movie by Disney and Pixar Animation Studios Inc. that is inspired by the holiday.
The Los Angeles-based humorist created a movie poster that quickly went viral of a skeletal Godzilla-sized Mickey Mouse, with the words: “It’s coming to trademark your cultura (culture).”

Bye Bye Democracy!: It was a very bad year
Bye Bye Democracy!
In a functioning democracy, corporations answer to the government and the government answers to its citizens. In the US, it's the other way around. Our pseudo-democracy, through its propaganda machine, has led to a culture in decline (TM).
Tuesday, December 31, 2013
It was a very bad year
In the year 2013
It was a very bad year
It was a very bad year
For global warning and climate change
With all its twisters and storms
And the earth forlorn
In the year 2013.
It was a no good very bad year for the environment. Two massive EF-5 twisters it Oklahoma in May killing 24 and 19 people respectively. In November over 5,700 people were killed by one of the biggest and most vicious storms ever to hit hand: Typhoon Haiyan. Due to the warming oceans, we're expected to see fewer but bigger typhoons in the Pacific Ocean. The ocean temperature continue to rise. The Arctic and Antarctic continue to melt as well as glaciers continue to retreat worldwide.
At any moment, we could hit a "tipping point" where global warming becomes an unstoppable runaway train. Also called the "snowball effect" as a snowball increases size and speed as it rolls uncontrolled down a mountain.
Here's a shocker: Most estimates of global warming has been significantly underestimated by neglecting the Arctic due to the Arctic warming significantly faster than other parts of the globe. The reason the data was omitted in the first place was that it was not readily available. See the following video:
The end result is that, "global surface temperatures have actually risen about two and a half times faster over the past 15 years than previously estimated." Also, "the planet has been accumulating over 4 Hiroshima atomic bomb detonations worth of energy per second...since 1998." Source.
Global land and ocean surface temperatures for November 2013 was the highest on record which doesn't mean much by itself but it's a typical statistic. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
It was a bad year for animals, especially smaller, lower down on the food chain that serve as canaries in the coal mines: honey bees, butterflies, frogs and amphibians, and birds. Bees and butterflies play an important part of pollination of flowers, plants and food crops. See:
Sue Kedgley: Let's talk birds and bees seriously: Unless we urgently rethink our heavy pesticide use, we will poison ourselves and the species needed to survive
Global Crisis: Honeybee Population on the Decline
Amphibians In Dramatic Decline; Study Finds Nearly One-Third Of Species Threatened With Extinction
Finally, more carbon in the atmosphere means more carbon in the oceans which means the oceans become more acidic. From 9 Incredibly Important Things That Happened In 2013 That Most People Aren’t Talking About
6. The oceans changed dramatically, transforming into an acidic stew inhospitable to marine life.
Much of the conversation about climate change focuses on rising temperatures. But carbon dioxide emissions is rapidly making the oceans inhospitable for marine life. Why? According to studies “the ocean absorbs about 30 to 40 percent of the atmosphere’s excess carbon, causing its pH to drop.” These acidity levels can corrode the shells of crustaceans, and have lead to an explosion in jelly fish populations. One Oregon fisherman reported, “Sometimes we’ll catch 4,000 or 5,000 pounds of jellyfish.” Another fisherman said that “he saw baby octopuses climbing up his crab line to escape the water. When he pulled up his crab trap, all the crabs were dead.”

We’re Lucky Climate Change Didn’t Happen Sooner
July 25, 2016 Eurasia Review 0 Comments
By Eurasia Review
There is some consolation in how the fossil fuel-induced climatic changes we increasingly experience through droughts and storm surges are playing out. It could have happened sooner, and therefore already have been much worse.
Luckily, the natural atmosphere already contained carbon dioxide, enough that the human-induced changes were relatively small, for a long time. Had these concentrations been even slightly lower, the effects of the emission of harmful greenhouse gases would have been felt much earlier, at a time when mankind was not yet ready or knowledgeable enough to face up to mitigation efforts. This silver lining approach is taken by David Archer of the University of Chicago in the US, in a scenario exercise in Springer’s journal Climatic Change.
The concentration of carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere is measured as parts per million of dry air, or ppm. In the climatic past and earlier glacial periods, this level fluctuated between 180 ppm and 260 ppm. Measurements taken of Antarctic sheet ice show that the concentration of naturally occurring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was already 278 ppm in the 1750s before industrialization started in earnest.
“If the initial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were half its actual value, we would currently be experiencing the climate expected for the year 2050,” said Archer, setting out one possible scenario. “If there were only one-tenth as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere initially, the climate forcing we are experiencing today would have already happened, in the year 1900.”
Archer therefore describes the climatic changes currently being experienced on Earth as “moderate,” thanks to the blanketing effect that naturally occurring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has had. This has given scientists the time to piece together an understanding of Earth’s climate system and the effects of fossil fuel emissions.
The first ideas about radiative balance and the greenhouse effect date back to 1827, while predictions about climatic sensitivity due to carbon dioxide were made by 1896. It was, however, only after the advent of the computer that a modern understanding emerged of how fossil fuel use would impact the climate. This understanding was able to mature to the extent of public warnings about it by the 1970s.
“If the natural concentration had been a factor of two or more lower, the climate impacts of fossil fuel carbon dioxide release would have occurred about 50 or more years sooner, making it much more challenging for the developing human society to scientifically understand the phenomenon of manmade climate change in time to prevent it,” he said. “To the extent that a thorough scientific understanding is also a requisite for making a decision to abandon fossil fuels, the outlook for humanity would have been considerably darker in this altered world than it has turned out in actuality.”

President Trump Signs NASA Transition Authorization Act Of 2017 – OpEd
March 26, 2017 Eurasia Review 0 Comments
By Eurasia Review
“Almost half a century ago, our brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the moon. That was a big moment in our history. Now this nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today we’re taking the initial steps toward a bold and brave new future for American space flight,” said US President Donald Trump.
This week President Donald J. Trump signed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Transition Authorization Act of 2017, the first comprehensive NASA authorization passed by Congress in more than six years. The bill demonstrates strong bipartisan support for our Nation’s space program and helps ensure that NASA remains at the forefront of exploration and discovery.
The Act, passed unanimously by Congress, authorizes the development and execution of a long-range plan for deep space human exploration; invests in robust science, technology and aeronautics portfolios; and endorses the Agency’s successful efforts to nurture a new commercial market that will boost our economy and create more jobs. Additionally, it guarantees vastly improved health care for the heroes who risk their lives in the exploration of space.
Text of the authorization act can be found here and the full video of President Trump signing the act can be found here.

Salman-Trump Telephone Diplomacy – OpEd
January 30, 2017 Arab News 0 Comments
By Arab News
By Abdulrahman Al-Rashed*
Some troublesome voices disapprove of the exclusion of Saudi Arabia from the list of seven Muslim-majority countries whose citizens are banned from entering the US.
President Donald Trump has not classified Saudis as terrorists, nor has he prohibited them from entering the US. Instead, he discussed with King Salman several regional topics in a phone call that was seen as a very significant shift in Saudi-US relations.
The king and president talked about establishing safe zones for Syrian refugees, cooperation in fighting terrorism in the Middle East, and addressing Iran’s regional activities. The two leaders also discussed bilateral relations, including enhancing economic cooperation, and for the first time the Muslim Brotherhood as a group responsible for terrorist activities.
Moreover, Trump’s phone call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan clearly indicates Washington’s new regional policy. These are not congratulatory phone calls for Trump, but political conversations about what should be done in the region.
US-Gulf relations went through a rather cold period under former President Barack Obama, and now need to get back on the right track. That requires both sides to unify their visions in dealing with regional issues to end the chaos that started in 2011. They should also strengthen joint efforts to fight terrorist organizations that spread like a cancer in the region.
Trump’s administration sees Iran as part of the problem, unlike the Obama administration, which viewed it as part of the solution. All these significant developments are intended to end chaos in Libya, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, and to coordinate efforts to fight terrorist groups.
Discussing the Brotherhood was no less important than considering Iran the source of chaos. The Islamist organization has played a bad role during Arab Spring-related unrest. It spoiled the Syrian uprising by insisting on converting it from a civilian to a religious revolution. The group also sought to dominate power in Egypt when its candidate won the presidential election.
In Tunisia, the Islamic Renaissance Party tried to dominate power, but external threats and pressures compelled it to back away and commit to democracy. Chaos in Libya is mostly caused by armed Islamist groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda, including the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, Ansar Al-Shariah and others that do not recognize the state.
Chaos has torn the region apart due to organizations sharing common denominators: Extremist ideologies and foreign influences. The Obama administration adopted a policy of indifference, as it deemed chaos a local issue and transitory phase, and was ready to accept its outcomes. But the reality on the ground was threatening the whole world, widening the scope of unrest and harboring terrorist organizations in states that have collapsed.
Today, there is international consensus to correct such wrong notions, with a collective desire for cooperation to stop chaos, eliminate terrorism and reconsider concepts, methods and alliances. Trump’s government says it is ready to engage in the process of stopping chaos and defeating terrorism.
Trump, who has now been in office for 10 days, has declared his intention to establish safe zones, something Obama declined to do for displaced Syrians, whose number exceeds 12 million at home and abroad.
We are supposed to not be influenced by others’ positions toward Trump, his administration, and internal and external policies. We should not make prejudgments.
More importantly, our vision should be formed through solutions offered by his administration for our region, and its willingness to cooperate positively.

India: Maoists Shocked In A ‘Safe Haven’ – Analysis
October 31, 2016 SATP 0 Comments
By SATP
By Deepak Kumar Nayak*
In the most successful operation ever conducted by the Security Forces (SFs) against the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), since the formation of the outfit in September 2004, SFs killed at least 24 CPI-Maoist cadres in two successive encounters in the Bejingi forest area, between Ramgarh and Panasput, in the Malkangiri District of Odisha on October 24, 2016. One Greyhound [the elite anti-Maoist force of the Andhra Pradesh (AP) Police] commando, Mohammed Abu Bakar, was also killed during the operation, while another commando was injured. A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including four AK-47 rifles, 10.303 rifles, three Self-Loading Rifles (SLRs), two INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) rifles, and four SBBL (Smooth Bore Breech Loading) guns were recovered from the encounter site. Police also recovered about 50 kit bags, one laptop, INR 216,000 in cash and a large quantity of Maoist literature. Another four Maoists were killed during the subsequent combing operation in the same area on October 25. Two Maoists were also killed in the same area on October 27, yielding a total of 30 Maoists killed in a quick succession of SF operations in the region.
Following a tip-off about movement of the Maoists in the area which falls along the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha Border (AOB), Odisha Police sought the help of the AP Police and, subsequently, a combined team of AP Police, Greyhounds, Odisha Police Special Operations Group (SOG) and the District Volunteer Force (DVF, mostly comprising ex-service men) carried out the operation. Between 50 and 60 Maoists were reportedly holding a ‘plenary session’, which was also attended by the Maoist Central Committee (CC) member Akkiraju Hargopal aka Ramakrishna aka RK, the ‘secretary’ of the Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC) and overall in-charge of Maoist activity in the region. The Maoists had assembled there to discuss their tactical counter offensive campaign (TCOC) against the SFs and were reportedly planning ‘something big’ to revive their movement in the region.
On October 26, 2016, Odisha State Home Secretary, Asit Tripathy disclosed that, of the 28 bodies recovered by the Police, 18 had been identified. Those killed included Bakuri Venkata Ramana Murthy aka Ganesh aka Prasad aka Ramireddy, ‘official spokesman’ of AOBSZC and ‘secretary’ of east division unit of the party; Chemella Krishnaiah aka Bhaskar aka Daya, ‘secretary’ of the Koraput-Srikakulam ‘joint division’ of the AOBSZC; Gamelli Kesava Rao aka Birsu, ‘area commander’ of First Central Regional Committee (CRC) and ‘divisional committee secretary’ of the Koraput-Srikakulam ‘division’; Anna Parthi Dasu aka Madhu (50), member of the inner protection team around Bakuri Venkata Ramana Murthy and ‘divisional committee member’ (DCM), technical team of West Godavari; Geddam Suvarnaraju aka Kiran (38), brother-in-law of Madhu; Prabhakar Kapukka alias PKM aka Devendra, DCM; Latha aka Jyothi aka Padma, DCM and wife of Dubashi Shankar aka Mahendra, ‘Special Zonal Committee Member’, (SZCM), of the Hyderabad area; Rajesh aka Bimal, ‘area commander’ of First CRC and DCM from Chhattisgarh; Mamata aka Banajalas Nirmala aka Boddu Kundanalu Maru (DCM of Third CRC of the party and wife of Suresh, SZCM of the Srikakulam area); Yamalapalli Simhachalam aka Murali aka Krishna aka Hari, key member of Central Committee member RK’s protection team and DCM of the Vizianagaram District; Kameswari aka Swarna aka Swaroopa aka Ricky, part of cadre supply team and DCM of Pedabayalu; Kilo Sita aka Swetha, part of cadre supply team and ‘area committee member’ (ACM) of Pedabayalu; Budri, woman bodyguard of RK’s inner protection team and ACM from Chhattisgarh; and key members in RK’s security cordon, Munna aka Akkiraju Prithvi aka Shivaji (27), an ACM of Malkangiri’s cut-off area Local Guerrilla Squad (LGS), and Raino aka Sunil aka Jalmuri Srinu Babu, DCM of Third CRC of the party. Ganesh and Daya carried a reward of INR two million each.
The second most successful operation in terms of fatalities among Maoists across India was the November 23, 2010, incident in which 20 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in an encounter with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and State Police personnel near Aasrampura village of the Jagargunda area in the Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh. There were three earlier operations in which 20 Maoists had been killed: On February 17, 2008, at least 20 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed during ongoing combing operations by SFs in the border area of the Nayagarh-Ganjam-Kandhamal Districts of Odisha; on July 9, 2007, at least 24 SF personnel and 20 CPI-Maoist cadres were killed in a gun battle that occurred when a joint team of the CRPF and Chhattisgarh Police were combing the Elampatti-Regadgatta forest area of Dantewada District of Chhattisgarh; and on June 24, 2005, SFs killed at least 20 CPI-Maoist cadres during a nightlong operation in the East Champaran and Sheohar Districts of Bihar.
The most successful previous operation in the AOB region in terms of fatalities among Maoists had been carried out in September 2013, in Malkangiri District. On September 14, 2013, at least 14 Maoists were killed in an encounter with the State Police SOG and the DVF near Silakota village under the Podia Block of Malkangiri District. However, no senior Maoist leader was killed in that encounter. A CPI-Maoist ‘divisional committee’ member, identified as Rakesh, who was present at the encounter site, had managed to escape.
The AOB region comprises of nine Districts –East Godavari, Khammam, Srikakulam, Vishakhapatnam and Vizianagaram Districts of AP; and Gajapati, Koraput Malkangiri and Rayagada of Odisha. Presently, Khammam is a part of Telangana. Between September 21, 2004 and October 2016, the region witnessed at least 715 Maoist-related fatalities, including 298 civilians, 147 SFs and 270 Maoists. During the same period, 7,254 such fatalities, including 2,926 civilians, 1,847 SFs and 2,481 Maoists, had been recorded across India. The AOB region has thus accounted for almost 10 per cent of the total Maoist-related fatalities during this period across India.
The AOB region has long been one of the Maoists’ strongholds. A small part of the region situated at the tri-junction of three states – AP, Chhattisgarh and Odisha– acts as a bridge for the Maoists to cross freely from one State to the other. This served as a ‘safe haven’ for the Maoists, as the region’s difficult terrain made it tougher for SFs to carry out combing operations. According to an unnamed senior Police officer involved in anti-Maoist operations, “It is very difficult to enter the cut-off area located in AOB. The area is covered with thick forests and water bodies are in full spate during monsoon and now. Maoists who consider AOB as a safe zone conduct plenary and plenums during this chosen season (sic).”
The Maoist ‘movement’ is presently facing severe challenges across India due to various factors, the primary among which has been successful intelligence-based operations launched by SFs, and spearheaded by the AP Police Special Intelligence Branch (SIB) over the past years, which have helped neutralize top cadres among the extremists. According to the partial database compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), between 2010 and 2016 (till October 30), at least 775 Maoist leadership elements have been neutralized (93 killed, 434 arrested, 248 surrendered). According to UMHA data, the total number of LWE cadres arrested between 2010 and 2015 stood at 11,608. During the same period at least 633 LWE cadres surrendered. From a peak of 1,180 Maoist-linked fatalities across India in 2010, the fatalities came down to 215 in 2015. Unsurprisingly, the ‘movement’ is also waning in the AOB region. Overall fatalities in Maoist violence in the region witnessed sharp decline from a peak of 93 in 2010 to 35 in 2015.
Meanwhile, the AP Government gave permission to private bauxite mining companies in the Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam tribal belts of AP in 2008 to set up a mining-cum-refinery project. This irked the tribals and provided an opportunity to the Maoists to expand their base. They resorted to several abductions of public representatives and officials, including Vineel Krishna, the then District Collector of Malkangiri, in 2011, besides killing a few public representatives and Policemen in the border villages. The Maoists have also called for frequent shutdowns in the towns and villages of the AOB area and conducted ‘public meetings’ in the forests. Nevertheless, they have failed in their efforts to revive their ‘movement’.
Documents recovered at the encounter site in Malkangiri on October 24-25, 2016, indicate that the Maoists are deeply concerned about the status of their ‘movement’ in the AOB region and were desperate to do ‘something big’. The loss of leadership elements of the region during the encounter, however, has served a body blow to the outfit and will impact severely on their operational capabilities.

Vital soil saving techniques
As World Soil Day on 5th December 2015 marks the ending of the International Year of Soils, it is reassuring to know that scientists will still be working to find solutions to protect our soils.
2015 was declared International Year of Soils by the United Nations in order to raise awareness of the profound importance of soil for human life . As well as providing us with food and fibre, soils can also play an important role in climate change mitigation by storing carbon and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Meaning they have a vital role to play in the current Climate Change discussions in Paris.
As global attention now moves away from soils, scientists working on an EU funded project called RECARE will still be developing solutions to the problems of soil erosion, soil compaction, soil contamination, flooding and landslides, desertification, soil biodiversity loss, decline in organic matter, salinization and soil sealing. The challenges to peoples’ lives and homes are detailed in an international series of documentaries showing how damaging soils, damages lives.
RECARE researchers are working with the local people across Europe in 17 case study areas to put soil saving solutions into practice. Low tech but scientifically informed interventions are set to transform the protection of soils and the lives of those affected by them. Examples include, grassed waterways, straw mulching or terracing to prevent soil erosion and flooding, the use of intercropping to increase soil organic matter, or the planting of particular tree species to remove the toxins from contaminated soils. RECARE has already produced a review of potential measures that can be applied to combat these soil threats .
Professor Coen Ritsema is the RECARE Project Co-ordinator and is based at Wageningen University, The Netherlands. He said,
“As the International Year of Soils draws to a close, it is good to know that work continues to protect this precious resource. The project team is committed to ensuring that we are able to provide people with practical, affordable ways in which they can protect our soil resources. 2015 has raised awareness of the soils vital role in all of our lives, now we need to take action”.
RECARE researchers will continue their work to develop effective prevention, remediation and restoration measures in the battle against soil threats until 2018, when the project is due to finish.

UK's Nuclear Illusion
UK Parliament’s decision to authorise the construction of 10 new nuclear power plants was taken on the basis of misleading evidence Prof. Peter Saunders
UK’s commitment to nuclear
In early May 2012, Japan shut down its last nuclear power station for routine maintenance in a safety drive since the Fukushima meltdown, leaving the country nuclear free for the first time in more than 40 years [1]. Before the Fukushima disaster, Japan got 30% of its power from nuclear energy. Hundreds marched through Tokyo to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan.
Most other countries are having second thoughts about nuclear power; some like Germany and Italy have already decided to do without it and others like Japan may follow [2] (Fukushima Fallout (SiS 51), but the UK government is still determined to go ahead with the construction of at least 10 new reactors. This is the only way we can fulfil our future energy needs and still meet our commitment to reduce carbon emissions, so we are told; besides, nuclear is the cheapest alternative to fossil fuels and is safer than coal. Every one of those claims is contradicted by evidence, as we have shown in numerous reports.
Nuclear power could only make a comparatively small contribution to our total energy needs and this could be supplied from renewable sources such as wind and solar (see [3] Green Energies - 100% Renewable by 2050, I-SIS publication). It is also very expensive; the government insisted there would be no subsidy for nuclear power even though no nuclear plant has ever been built without a subsidy and no one, least of all the companies that are expected to invest in them, seriously believes one ever will be. The government is already discussing with the industry what form the subsidy should take -probably a ‘contract for difference’ that will ensure a higher than market price - and how large it will be. It is also negotiating with the European Commission to ensure that the subsidy is permitted under EU rules [4].
Nuclear plants are notorious for coming in years late and hugely over budget and the two currently under construction in Europe at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France, are no exceptions [5] (The Real Cost of Nuclear Power, SiS 47). And the danger of a major incident like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima is ever-present [6] (Lessons of Fukushima and Chernobyl, SiS 50). For the latest information, see [7, 8] Chernobyl Deaths Top a Million Based on Real Evidence and Truth about Fukushima, SiS 55).
There is a massive amount of evidence in the public domain against the nuclear option. Has the government somehow managed not to notice any of it? The recent report, A Corruption of Governance? ,published jointly by the Association for the Conservation of Energy (ACE) and Unlock Democracy goes a long way towards answering this question [9]. By careful reading of Government documents and statements, especially the Draft Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) [10] and the Draft National Policy Statement for Nuclear Power Generation (EN-6) [11] the authors of the report, Ron Bailey and Lotte Blair, demonstrated that the government was well aware of the evidence against nuclear energy; but simply omitted to draw attention to it in Parliament when the decision was being taken.
How much electricity will we need?
Power stations take a long time to build, so if we want to have enough energy in 2025 or 2050, we need to start planning now. The first step, you would think, is to estimate how much energy we will be using, then work out how much of the different sources – fossil, solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, and so on – we could have in place by then. This will enable us to decide on a strategy taking into account factors such as cost, safety and the need to reduce carbon emissions.
That’s not what the government did. Instead of analysing present consumption and trends, they asked a consulting firm Redpoint Energy to predict what the generating capacity would be in 2025, including both the proposed nuclear new build programme and the new renewables capacity that would be required to achieve the government’s goal of about 29% of electricity from renewables by that date [12]. Redpoint came up with the figure of 110 GW, which is a prediction of what the generating capacity will be if present policies are carried out. But the government is now using this as its estimate of the UK’s need for energy in 2025, and a justification for the policies.
As for 2050, after they had spent much time and effort trying to get the government to supply information regarding demand up to and beyond that date, Bailey and Blair were told that there are no published assessments that extend that far. They then asked if there were any unpublished assessments or evidence and were told there were none. That hasn’t stopped the Government from telling us over and over again that “electricity demand could double by 2050.”
What will it cost?
When the Secretary of State was asked for an estimate of the relative costs of energy generation infrastructure, he provided a table that showed the levelised cost (i.e the price at which the electricity must be sold to break even, averaged over the lifetime of the plant) of nuclear as 6.8p/kWh, lower than a selection of other options, such as modern coal and gas plants, onshore and offshore wind [13]. He did not include other sources, for example, biomass combined heat and power (CHP), gas CHP and landfill or sewage gas, all of which also appear in the Mott MacDonald (UK government) report [14] he was citing and are cheaper than nuclear, even according to the report. He also did not remind MPs that renewable sources, such as solar and offshore wind, have a record of becoming considerably less expensive over time, whereas there is no prospect that nuclear will become cheaper in the foreseeable future because the lead time to employing new technology is so long. On the contrary, the cost of constructing nuclear plants generally rises considerably faster than inflation [3].
Bailey and Blair also noticed that the government assumed the nuclear plants would operate for 60 years, although experience shows that even 40 years is optimistic. In the first draft of the EN-1 document, the operating life is given as “in the region of 40-60” years. In the revised draft and in the final document, “40” has disappeared and the lifetime is given as 60 years. The Mott MacDonald analysis of costs assumes an operating lifetime of 60 years, but there is no reference given for that. The operating lifetime is especially important in considering nuclear power because so much of the total cost is in building the plants rather than in supplying them with fuel.
When the government announced that it was going ahead with 10 more nuclear power plants, it assured us that this would only happen if they could be built without subsidies. Anyone who looked at the evidence could see that this was impossible and indeed that was the view of the major investment bankers [4]. We can now be certain that the government knew that too.
The German company E.ON has pulled out of building nuclear reactors and the only companies left in the field, Electricité de France and Centrica, have made it clear that they will go ahead only if they are guaranteed a sufficiently high price for the electricity their nuclear plants produce [15]; a large subsidy, in other words.
Is nuclear necessary?
The report the government presented to Parliament greatly exaggerated our future energy needs and underestimated the cost of nuclear energy relative to other non-carbon sources. Despite this, it might – in principle – still be possible that we will not be able both to keep the lights on and meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets without it. That is far from the case. We have given details in our report [3] but perhaps the most convincing evidence is that the German government has already committed itself to closing down its existing nuclear facilities and not replacing them, and it is confident it can reach its targets without them.
The British government too knows that it is perfectly feasible to cope without nuclear. In 2010 and 2011 it published two “Pathways” reports [16]. Each included a number of scenarios that could achieve the required 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 and also satisfy the nation’s energy requirements. Of the 16 scenarios in the 2011 report, 6 involved no new nuclear build [5].
In the EN-1 and EN-6 National Policy Statements [NPSs] presented to Parliament, however, MPs were told that ‘failure to develop new nuclear power stations significantly earlier than the end of 2025 would increase the risk of the UK being locked into a higher carbon energy mix’ [17]. They were not told that more than one in three of the scenarios showed that an adequate supply of low carbon energy could be produced without nuclear.
The Director of ACE, Andrew Warren, wrote about this to Charles Hendry MP, the Minister responsible for nuclear power. A Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) official eventually replied [6] “you note that the overview of the Pathways 2050 analysis in EN-1 did not present the full information to MPs on all the possible options” and he justified this by saying “this is not, however, the purpose of the NPSs”.
It seems a “national policy statement” is just that: a statement of government policy backed by arbitrary ‘evidence’ selected to justify what the government has decided to do. It is not an impartial presentation of the available evidence to help Parliament reach the best decision. It would be interesting to know whether our MPs understand this.
Why was it done?
Bailey and Blair believe that it was not government ministers who misled Parliament; that they themselves were given biased information. That’s not implausible. Ministers are busy and do not have the time to go through in detail every document they receive, still less to look up and read all the references. They rely heavily on summaries provided by their staff. We know that in real life, as in Yes Minister, civil servants and advisers are not above pushing their own agendas and keeping relevant information from their ministers.
All the same, we’re not convinced. We don’t recall hearing any former ministers complaining that they were misled about nuclear energy while they were in office. The real question is why a government should deliberately ignore evidence and choose an option that is going to be more expensive and less effective than the alternative. The most likely explanation is simply that over time, a close and comfortable relationship has grown up between governments on the one hand – ministers and civil servants alike – and the nuclear lobby on the other.
Sixty years ago, many people believed both that the UK needed its own atomic bomb and also that nuclear power would provide an unlimited supply of cheap electricity. The military and civilian projects have remained together ever since and have supported each other in many ways, as they have in other countries (see The True Costs of French Nuclear Power [18], SiS 53). For example, one of the advantages (from this point of view) of a pressurised water reactor is that it produces plutonium, which can be used in weapons. And much of the cost of research can be hidden in the defence budget, which tends not to be looked at with the same critical eye that other departments may experience.
Times have changed. We now know that nuclear power is neither cheap nor safe, and even though most people agree that we have to find alternatives to fossil fuels, we also know that nuclear is by no means best option for that.
The military situation is also different from before. Even those who believe it was nuclear weapons that kept the peace until the fall of the Soviet Union have been unable to suggest an even remotely plausible scenario in which they might be useful now. They certainly contributed nothing to our efforts in the Falklands, Bosnia, Iraq, Libya or Afghanistan. If anything, they only diverted expenditure from equipment that the soldiers who fought in those wars desperately needed.
Yet in the face of all the evidence, the government persists with its nuclear energy programme and uses policy-based evidence to justify it to Parliament. It is bound and determined to spend an estimated £20 billion on a replacement for Trident when no one has any idea what use it could possibly be.
The nuclear lobby see themselves as working at the cutting edge of science, promoting the most modern technologies for the defence of the realm and for supplying our energy needs. Successive governments have taken them at their word, and over the years their influence has grown. In fact, theirs is a mid 20th century vision. We are now in the 21st century and the energy of the future is renewables. As for defence, whatever the answer is, it is not Trident. It is time to end our fascination with the nuclear illusion.

The decision to build new nuclear power plants was taken by committee before the Fukushima debacle and so long after the Chernobyl debacle that the committee may not have been aware of the scale of the catstrophe. WHO and Atomic Energy authorities have done such a good propaganda job on the TRUTH that even experts in the field have been duped. Fukushima was enough to wake up several countries to the fallacy of RISK - BENEFIT analysis. And Britain's other fallacy was to use Chernobyl to prevent 150 sheep farms EVER selling meat to the public. This embargo for reasons of nuclear pollution came just after Chernobyl and the farms affected centred on that unfortunate little village of SELLAFIELD.

I have studied physics and the uses of radioactive material. I have always known that "nuclear Power" was used to cover the cost of production of nuclear weapons. The complete chain of energy from raw uranium through enrichment and conversion to steam to turn a turbine to produce electricity takes too much electricity. the changes in form are wasteful of energy. From the first coal powered plant that produces steam to turn the turbines that send electricty to the enrichment plant at Paducah,KY. to the final stage of electricity from a nuclear decay of uranium to produce heat to produce steam to turn a turbine and make elecricity there is a great loss of energy and no gain. Nuclear Power is a hoax!

The Cost of Caregiving
About 40 million family caregivers in the United States provide unpaid care to another adult.1 Caregiving for a loved one is a noble endeavor, and considering the high cost of professional long-term care, it may be the only alternative for some families. But "free" caregiving often comes with financial, physical, and emotional costs. If you are a family caregiver, or know someone who is, here are some suggestions to consider.
Preserve your own assets. More than three out of four caregivers incur out-of-pocket expenses, with average spending approaching $7,000 annually. Expenses can be even higher when the person being cared for requires longer hours of care, needs help with more daily activities and/or medical/nursing tasks, is suffering from mental illness or dementia, or lives at a distance from the caregiver.2
Although it's generous to help an aging parent or other relative financially, be realistic about your own present and future financial needs. It might make more sense to spend down an older person's assets, which could reduce the taxable estate and/or qualify him or her for long-term care benefits under Medicaid.
Take advantage of available benefits. Make sure the person you are caring for has all the benefits to which he or she is entitled. The Eldercare Locator (eldercare.gov), a public service of the U.S. Administration on Aging, and the Benefits CheckUp website (benefitscheckup.org) from the National Council on Aging are helpful places to start.
Talk to your employer. One out of three caregivers has changed work hours and 20% have reduced work hours; 22% have taken unpaid leave.3 Many companies include family care in their sick-leave policies, and you might be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Educate yourself. Make sure you fully understand your loved one's condition, medications, and appropriate methods of care. Ensure that you are authorized to speak to physicians and health providers regarding the patient's treatment plan. Don't hesitate to call with questions, and keep a running list of issues for the next office visit.
Take care of yourself. Many caregivers suffer from physical or mental conditions that are caused or exacerbated by the strain of providing care. Take regular breaks to rest or enjoy a favorite activity. Ask for help from other family members and friends. Consider support groups. Don't be afraid to seek professional help for yourself.

Stocks in Interest Rate Hike Cycles
Stock-Markets / Stock Markets 2015 Dec 24, 2015 - 09:22 PM GMT
By: Zeal_LLC
The stock-market outlook in 2016 is riddled with great uncertainty following the Fed ending its 7-year-old zero-interest-rate policy. With the first rate-hike cycle in nearly a decade just getting underway, traders are anxiously wondering how it will impact the stock markets. While raising rates out of ZIRP is radically unprecedented, stock-market reactions during past rate-hike cycles still offer some interesting insights.
The Federal Reserve’s monetary-policy decisions are no longer peripheral concerns for stock-market fortunes. Thanks to the Fed’s extreme easing of recent years, its actions have usurped everything else to become the stock markets’ overwhelmingly dominant driver. And unfortunately the wildly-outsized upside impact on stock prices by the uber-dovish Fed is highly likely to portend proportional downside.
This all started back in late 2008’s once-in-a-century stock panic, when the Bernanke Fed joined in the panicking. On December 16th, 2008, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee that makes its policy decisions slashed its benchmark federal-funds-rate target by a staggering 100 basis points (hundredths of a percent) to zero. This was the first time in the Fed’s entire history since 1913 that it implemented ZIRP!
But once it bullies rates to nothing, the Fed hits the zero lower bound where it can no longer cut rates to attempt to stimulate the economy. That leaves its final option of money printing, conjuring up new money out of thin air. Weeks before ZIRP was born, the Fed was already spinning up its first debt-monetization campaign known as quantitative easing. This pleasant euphemism obscures the fact this is pure inflation.
So since late 2008, the monetary environment in the United States has been epically unprecedented. The Fed has stormed so far into uncharted territory that it defies belief. In the last normal year of 2007, the federal-funds rate averaged 5.0%. That’s right in line with the quarter-century average ending that year of 5.5%. During the subsequent ZIRP years since, the FFR averaged nearly 98% lower at 0.13%!
In 2007 the Fed’s balance sheet averaged $830b. The Fed’s extreme QE money printing ever since has ballooned this to an average of $4450b in 2015, a mind-boggling 5.4x higher! If the Fed had grown its balance sheet at a reasonable rate around 7% annually, it would only be 1.7x higher today or $1425b. It’s exceedingly important to remember the past 7 years’ monetary policy has been the most extreme ever by far!
Such a crazy-easy Fed was tremendously bullish for the stock markets, especially starting in early 2013 when its third quantitative-easing campaign spun up to full steam. QE3 was very different from its predecessors in that it was open-ended, with no predetermined size or end date. Top Fed officials deftly used this to their advantage, aggressively jawboning the stock markets higher through an implied Fed Put.
Every time the stock markets started sliding into a normal healthy pullback, Fed officials would rush to the podiums to reassure they were ready to expand QE3’s bond monetizations if necessary. This effective central-bank backstop seduced stock traders to keep buying back in, ignoring all normal market indicators. The result was recent years’ extraordinary Fed-conjured stock-market levitation, a wildly-unprecedented anomaly.
Keep these vast Fed distortions in mind as you consider stock-market behavior during past Fed-rate-hike cycles. The incredible and record-setting-in-many-ways stock-market levitation leading into this latest rate-hike cycle was the direct result of the easiest Fed ever seen by an enormous margin. So there’s a very high probability the mean-reversion aftermath will be proportionally as severe and record-setting.
Nevertheless, the stock markets’ behavior in past Fed-rate-hike cycles is still worth studying. I recently completed a deep-research project looking at every FOMC decision changing its federal-funds-rate target since 1971. It turns out this happened a whopping 252 times over this span! Since the FOMC meets 8 times per year, that works out to FFR target changes happening at over 2/3rds of the 360ish meetings.
Provocatively the Fed doesn’t always hike rates in cycles, a series of multiple sequential hikes with no intervening cuts. There were 6 times in that nearly-half-century history where the Fed made one lone hike that was bracketed by cuts. There were an additional 6 times where the FFR target was raised twice in succession before it was reduced again. One or two isolated hikes certainly don’t make a rate-hike cycle.
The most generous definition possible for a Fed-rate-hike cycle is 3 or more consecutive FFR increases with no interrupting decreases. It turns out the Fed has executed fully 11 of these rate-hike cycles in the 45 years since 1971. The charts below reveal the benchmark S&P 500 stock index’s performance over the exact spans of these cycles, starting the days of their first hikes and ending the days of their last ones.
While all rate-hike cycles are highlighted in light red, these don’t always perfectly match the troughs and peaks in the federal-funds rate. The Fed actually doesn’t directly control the FFR, which is technically a free-market interest rate determined by federal-funds supply and demand. Commercial banks use this market to borrow and lend their required cash reserve deposits held at the Fed on an overnight basis.
The Fed instead sets an FFR target, which it then attempts to achieve through open-market operations where it directly buys and sells in the federal-funds market. While the Fed’s sophistication in bullying the FFR to its target has grown over the years, there are still deviations. Bending the free market to its will can literally take tens of billions to hundreds of billions of dollars of trading, it certainly isn’t a trivial task.
A half-dozen key data points are noted for each Fed-rate-hike cycle. They start at the top with the total increase in basis points. That’s followed by the number of individual hikes in each cycle, as well as their average basis-point increases per hike and per month. After that is each rate-hike cycle’s duration measured in months, finally followed by the S&P 500’s performance during each cycle’s exact span.
Recent months’ raging debate about this newest rate-hike cycle’s likely impact on the stock markets has been something of a Rorschach test, revealing traders’ inherent biases. Stock-market bulls argue that Fed rate hikes are bullish for stocks, because the Fed wouldn’t dare raise rates unless the underlying US economy is really improving. I’ve heard this case being made hundreds of times on CNBC recently.
Meanwhile the stock-market bears believe Fed rate hikes are bearish for stocks because they mark the end of the easiest monetary policies on record which levitated the stock markets. Take away the gigantic hot-air injectors of ZIRP and QE, and the artificial balloon they inflated shrivels up and collapses. It is rather amusing to see stock markets’ historical action during past Fed-rate-hike cycles support neither thesis!
The S&P 500 (SPX) climbed in the majority 6 of the 11 Fed-rate-hike cycles of the modern era, with an average gain of 11.1% during these wins. That’s pretty darned impressive, since the average duration of those particular rate-hike cycles was just 10.6 months. If that kind of performance is coming again, the bulls will rejoice. But during the other 5 cycles, the SPX lost 7.1% over an average duration of 13.5 months.
If the SPX’s performance during all 11 Fed-rate-hike cycles is averaged together, it is almost a wash with a mere 2.8% gain. This ambiguous result of a small upside bias doesn’t show clear direction either way. It’s fascinating comparing this to gold, which American futures speculators have been universally assuming will be crushed in this newest Fed-rate-hike cycle. Yet gold vastly outperformed the SPX in past ones.
Gold’s average gain during these same 11 Fed-rate-hike cycles of the modern era was 26.9%, nearly an order of magnitude greater than the stock markets’! Gold also rallied in 6 of these 11, but by a far-greater average of 61.0%. So while stock markets’ performance in Fed-rate-hike cycles has been ambiguous and directionless, gold’s has proved just the opposite. Stock-market bulls are betting on the wrong horse.
I was surprised stock markets’ historical performance during Fed-rate-hike cycles wasn’t worse. Rising interest rates hit stocks on multiple fronts. As higher rates increase debt-servicing costs throughout the economy, there is less money available to buy products and services from corporations. So rising rates lead to slowing sales, which are leveraged to a larger downside impact on overall corporate profitability.
Weaker earnings raise valuations, making stocks less attractive. On top of that, higher rates drive up the prevailing yields in the bond markets. This leads investors to migrate away from riskier dividend-paying stocks into bonds. Rate-hike cycles also prove the Fed has a tightening bias, which turns psychology on the stock markets bearish. So practically, Fed-rate-hike cycles simply shouldn’t be bullish for stock markets.
But the hard historical data didn’t bear this out, with the SPX rallying in the majority of the Fed-rate-hike cycles, seeing bigger average gains in those than losses in the others, and achieving that small overall average gain. Given the fundamental impact of higher rates on stock prices, this seemed odd. So we have to dig deeper into individual Fed-rate-hike cycles, which paints a more coherent picture of what to expect.
The stock markets meander in great third-of-a-century cycles I call Long Valuation Waves. Each wave’s first half is a mighty secular bull lasting about 17 years. These see investors flock to stocks and bid up their prices far faster than underlying corporate earnings are growing, ratcheting up their valuations. Eventually valuations grow too excessive and greed peaks, which ushers in each wave’s second half.
That’s a symmetrical 17-year secular bear, in which stock prices simply grind sideways on balance for long enough to let earnings catch up with the preceding bull peak’s lofty stock prices. Secular bears consist of an alternating series of cyclical bears and bulls, which first cut stock prices in half and then double them back up to breakeven again. These great valuation cycles explain the SPX’s rate-hike-cycle behavior.
A 16.7-year secular bull peaked back in February 1966, paving the way for a 16.5-year secular bear running to August 1982. This sideways-grinding trend of stock prices consolidating for long enough to enable profits to catch up and lower excessive valuations was the key driving force behind the markets during the first 5 Fed-rate-hike cycles of the modern era. And they saw average SPX losses of 5.5%.
If the stock markets were relatively high in their secular-bear consolidation trend when the Fed started to hike rates, they lost ground as mid-secular-bear cyclical bulls rolled over into cyclical bears. And since the Fed has always been worried about the stock-market reaction to its rate hikes due to the impact of the wealth effect on consumer spending and thus the overall economy, it never starts hiking near major stock lows.
After that in the 17.6 years between August 1982 and March 2000, the stock markets powered higher in their greatest secular bull on record. That period encompassed the next 5 Fed-rate-hike cycles, which saw average gains of 9.2%. The SPX rallied in 4 of those 5 secular-bull rate-hike cycles, compared to falling in 4 of the 5 secular-bear rate-hike cycles. This historical record is very provocative and illuminating.
The stock markets’ position within the Long Valuation Waves when new Fed-rate-hike cycles are born looks like the dominant driver of whether they rise or fall during those cycles. Fed rate hikes are likely to be ignored by stock markets powering higher in secular bulls, overcome by traders’ popular greed. But during secular bears, Fed rate hikes are overwhelmingly likely to help drive selling pushing stocks lower.
So if this newest Fed-rate-hike cycle is happening in a secular bull, stock markets are likely to shrug it off and keep on rallying on balance. But if the stock markets are really in a secular bear, rising rates will almost certainly force them lower. And unfortunately the fundamental and technical evidence is heavily in favor of the stock markets still being mired deep in the secular bear that started all the way back in early 2000.
When that last secular bull peaked, the stock markets were trading at extreme valuations up around 43x earnings. That is far into bubble territory above 28x, and the century-and-a-quarter average trailing-twelve-month price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is merely 14x. That’s fair value for stocks. After that extreme, stocks started grinding sideways giving profits time to grow into those lofty secular-bull-peak stock prices.
And indeed that’s exactly what happened between early 2000 and late 2012. The stock markets ground sideways on balance, first getting sliced in half in cyclical bears before doubling back up to breakeven again in cyclical bulls. Prevailing price-to-earnings ratios gradually normalized on balance, with underlying corporate profits rising faster than stock prices. It was a textbook secular bear until early 2013.
That’s when the Fed ramped up its wildly-unprecedented open-ended QE3 to full steam, and started brazenly jawboning the stock markets higher. So the SPX soon broke above its decade-plus secular-bear resistance near 1500 and ultimately levitated over 2100 by May 2015. This led stock investors to universally assume a new secular bull had been born, but odds are it was merely a gross Fed-conjured distortion.
When adjusted for basic CPI inflation, the S&P 500’s secular-bull peak of 1527 in March 2000 works out to just over 2100 in constant May-2015 dollars! So in righteous real inflation-adjusted terms, the stock markets have still never surmounted their last secular bull’s peak despite the extraordinary levitation the Fed fomented in recent years. The stock markets are still mired in that 17-year secular-bear sideways grind.
And with prevailing stock-market valuations just challenging 26x in recent months which isn’t far from 28x bubble territory, there’s no way this secular bear is over. Secular bears don’t end until the general-stock-market P/E ratio is way down near 7x, half fair value. Even in the dark heart of 2008’s stock panic and the subsequent early-2009 ultimate nadir, the SPX’s P/E ratio never fell much below 12x earnings.
And if the US stock markets indeed remain stuck in their long secular bear which the Fed temporarily tried to derail through the most aggressive easy-money policies in its entire century-long history, then this new Fed-rate-hike cycle is very bearish for stocks. There are high odds the stock markets will sell off on balance as the Fed hikes rates, likely seriously given today’s Fed-conjured near-bubble valuations.
And the coming stock-market selloff that Fed rate hikes will accelerate will be exacerbated by the gross distortions from ZIRP and QE in recent years. ZIRP’s impact on the stock markets was enormous, so the unwinding of ZIRP should largely reverse the SPX levitation. The primary mechanism through which ZIRP boosted stock prices so dramatically was through enormous levels of corporate stock buybacks.
With the Fed bullying short rates near zero through ZIRP, and long rates near record lows thanks to QE, the costs for corporations to borrow vast sums of money withered to all-time lows. So the majority of the elite US companies decided to undertake financial engineering to simultaneously boost their stock prices and earnings per share. They literally borrowed way over a trillion dollars to buy back their own stocks!
Over 3/4ths of the elite SPX companies engaged in stock buybacks, which bid up stock prices while also reducing the outstanding share count which increases earnings per share. This newest Fed-rate-hike cycle is going to start reversing these record-low corporate borrowing rates artificially created by ZIRP and QE. Even a modest uptick in prevailing rates will drastically alter the economics of corporate stock buybacks.
So the negative impact of the Fed hiking rates on buybacks financed with borrowed money alone are incredibly bearish for stock prices. And stock markets enjoyed a strong secondary boost in recent years from the Fed’s extreme policies forcing bond yields near record lows. This left investors seeking yields with no choice but to abandon Fed-pummeled bonds to migrate capital into far-riskier dividend-paying stocks.
With this new Fed-rate-hike cycle ending ZIRP and starting to allow bond yields to normalize again, all those legions of investors looking for yields to provide them incomes are going to start moving back into bonds. That will put even more selling pressure on stock markets as the Fed raises rates. So the selling stock markets will face as the Fed hikes rates out of record-low extremes are vastly greater than in normal cycles.
With that extraordinary stock-market levitation of recent years fueled by ZIRP going to unwind as interest rates slowly normalize, investors need to be exceedingly careful. They need to exit the overvalued stock markets and park that capital in cash or gold. Holding cash while stock markets fall grants a proportional gain in stock-share purchasing power after that selloff ends. Cash protects and preserves capital in bear markets.
But as one of the only assets that moves contrary to stock prices, gold grows capital during stock bears. Gold rallies on balance as stock markets sell off thanks to growing investment demand from investors seeking prudent portfolio diversification. Gold has actually thrived in past Fed-rate-hike cycles, enjoying exceptional average gains an order of magnitude higher than stock markets! This can be played two ways.
Investors can simply buy physical gold bullion or the flagship GLD SPDR Gold Shares gold ETF to mirror the coming gold upleg. But gold’s gains can be greatly leveraged in the left-for-dead gold stocks, which are still languishing near extreme 13-year secular lows. Their stock prices are at fundamentally-absurd levels relative to their existing profits, which will quickly soar as gold inevitably mean reverts far higher.
Gold stocks are likely to be the best-performing sector of 2016 by far, which is why we’ve aggressively bought and recommended many elite gold and silver stocks at Zeal in recent months. No other sector in all the markets is as undervalued and loathed, leaving vast room for gold stocks to soar as investors start to return. Buying in ahead of the herd before rate hikes’ impacts become apparent will yield the greatest gains.
We’ve long published acclaimed weekly and monthly subscription newsletters offering an essential contrarian perspective on the markets. They draw on our decades of exceptional experience, knowledge, wisdom, and ongoing research to explain what’s happening in the markets, why, and how to trade them with specific stocks. We buy low in deeply-out-of-favor sectors when few others will so we can later sell high when few others can as they return to favor. Subscribe today and multiply your wealth!
The bottom line is Fed-rate-hike cycles’ impact on the stock markets has been ambiguous, with the SPX seeing slightly-positive average gains. Stock markets’ performance during rate-hike cycles depends on where the markets happened to be in their long bull-bear cycles when the Fed starts hiking rates. Rate-hike cycles happening in bull markets see stocks tend to rise, and in bear markets see stocks tend to fall.
And not only do the stock markets remain mired deep in a secular bear today, but this newest Fed-rate-hike cycle is wildly unprecedented coming out of such record monetary-policy extremes. There is a very high chance that the Fed’s entire artificial stock-market levitation of recent years will be fully unwound as interest rates normalize. So the stock downside risks in this peculiar environment are far greater than normal.

Hundreds of thousands to rally for Catalan independence from Spain

Protesters carry Esteladas, Catalan separatist flags and Basque flags, during a rally in favour of a referendum on independence from Spain for the autonomous community of Catalonia, in the Basque city of Bilbao, Spain September 9, 2017.
MADRID/BARCELONA - Hundreds of thousands of Catalans are expected to rally in the streets of Barcelona on Monday in what campaigners hope will be a show of support for independence after Madrid moved to block a planned referendum on the region’s split from Spain.
The ‘Diada’ day of Sept. 11, which commemorates the fall of Barcelona to Spain in 1714, is often used by activists to voice their demands for an independent state. Coachloads of demonstrators travel to Barcelona from villages in the region.
Hostility between Madrid and Barcelona has ramped up since Spain’s Constitutional Court last Thursday suspended the referendum, planned for Oct. 1, following a legal challenge by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.
The government says the referendum contravenes the constitution, which states that Spain is indivisible.
Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has urged ‘independentistas’ to take to the streets on Monday in a massive show of support for the referendum.
“It’s vital that we come out in force for this Diada for the Oct. 1 referendum to be successful,” he said on Twitter. “I’ll be there.”
Spain’s state prosecutor has begun criminal proceedings against Puigdemont and 13 members of his cabinet on charges of misuse of public money, disobedience and abuse of office after the Catalan parliament approved the referendum last Wednesday.
Rajoy has urged Catalan civil servants and mayors to uphold the law and to stop any preparations for the referendum over the next three weeks.
However, around two-thirds of Catalonia’s mayors have so far said they will allow the use of municipal facilities for the vote, with one mayor ripping up a court order warning of legal repercussions in front of a cheering crowd.
Puigdemont has said he has ballot boxes and voting papers hidden and ready to deploy at any moment. Over the weekend, police searched a printing press and the offices of a local newspaper for signs of preparation for the referendum.
At the height of pro-independence fervor in 2012, during a deep economic recession in Spain, around one million people took to the streets waving the Catalan flag and singing the Catalan anthem.
Polls have shown support for independence waning since then, and those wanting a separate state are in a minority. However, a majority of Catalans want to hold a referendum on the issue.

Want Satisfaction? Have at Least 4 Children
Parents with big families report being happiest
By Neal Colgrass, Newser Staff

(Newser) – Parents with lots of kids running around doing God knows what, be thankful—you're the lucky ones. According to a new study in Australia, parents with at least four children get the most satisfaction out of life despite the chaos and higher expenses, the Daily Signal reports. "With large families, we think they have social support within the family," study lead Bronwyn Harman tells ABC News Australia. "The kids are never bored, they have someone to play with and they get independence quite early on." She interviewed 950 parents over a 5-year period to evaluate their happiness level, Yahoo reports, and asked them about self-esteem, social support, and resilience. While parents with big families did have issues—like people asking if the kids had multiple fathers—they were still the most satisfied.
Harmon thought they'd be stressed out, but "they said that they had planned a large family, it was a joyful experience for them, the house was often full of laughter, and there were many reasons to celebrate," she says. Second-happiest (by a razor-thin margin of 0.25%) were LGBT parents, who also planned their families and went the extra mile of getting kids by surrogacy, IVF, or adoption. "These children are not accidents ... so the child is very much desired," says Harmon. The least happy in her still-unpublished study were single dads, who she says are often seen as lesser parents and struggle to play a role in their childrens' lives. "There is this perception that mothers are the real parents and fathers just sort of help," Harmon tells the Sydney Morning Herald. (Now see what 53,000 children have to say about happiness.)

I think it's interesting in the story that they indicated LGTB parents and those with 4+ children tended to be happiest because their families were planned. For that same logic, it would be interesting to see if the smaller families that indicated they were happy also indicated if their families were planned. If they grouped all smaller families into one, then that would include people who did/did not want children, which could sway the average down....in that case, it's not the smaller family size itself that led to the unhappiness, but the fact that maybe having unwanted/unplanned children were stress factors. It could also be that people that are unhappy (whether it's external factors or directly related to the children) stop expanding their families. Again, the small family size not being the result of the unhappiness itself, but rather the small family size being the result of the unhappiness.

Platform
(As revised by the voting membership in convention, February 23rd, 2013)
In affirmation of the traditional respect for individual life, liberty, and property, the members of the Missouri Libertarian Party do establish our Platform and Program for the people of Missouri, in accordance with our State Constitution, to ensure harmony, abundance, and self-government to all citizens of our State. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following:
EDUCATION
Responsibility and authority for the education of children belongs with parents.
Restore local control of all schools.
Remove restrictions on home schooling.
Move toward privatization of government public schools.
Repeal all Federal and State education mandates.
ELECTIONS
Fair elections are the cornerstone of the democratic process.
Support fair ballot access and free and open elections.
Support reduction of signatures required for ballot initiative.
Support legislation requiring a “Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail” when using electronic voting equipment.
Repeal all Federal and State campaign finance laws which restrict Free Speech.
Support legislation requiring the use of an objective scientific metric when comparing alternatives for district boundaries to eliminate gerrymandering.
Have representation for more than just Democrats and Republicans. Elect the 163 representatives in the state house of representatives based on the percentage of the vote received by each established political party. This method is commonly used and often goes by the term Proportional Representation. The actual representatives would be chosen from the lists of 163 names submitted by each of the political parties.
Require majority rule. Use Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) to require a majority win in all other races with more than two candidates. IRV causes runoff elections to be conducted instantly until someone receives a majority. Voters say who their second choices would be in case their first choice does not receive a majority of the first vote.
Require true support for tax, bond, and referendum issues. Require them to be fairly represented to the voters. Allow votes on tax, bond and referendum issues to appear on the ballot in November elections only. In the case of a tax or bond issue, require the ballot language to state what the difference in taxes will be if the measure passes as compared to if it fails, and for how many years. For example, “If this school bond issues passes, the owner of a $100,000 home will pay $150 more in taxes each year for the next 30 years than they will if it fails.”
Vigorously combat election fraud. Conduct spot audits of elections.
Allow voters to express dissatisfaction with their choices. Make “None of the Above” a choice in all candidate elections.
Eliminate the position of Lt. Governor. Have the state legislature put this constitutional issue to the voters.
HEALTH CARE
Health care, like all economic goods and services is provided most efficiently and fairly by the free market.
Repeal Obamacare and phase out Medicare and Medicaid
Oppose any additional federal regulation of health care and government health care options.
Establish tax-free Health Savings Accounts.
Make all medical and dental expenses income tax deductible.
Restore patient choice in medical care by removing interference from the state, including limitations on access to nurse practitioners, midwifery, alternative medicine, and self-medication.
Restore a true free market in health care by removing federal and state regulations which restrict competition.
JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
When politicians and bureaucrats pick winners, Missourians lose. Resources are most efficiently and fairly allocated by the free market.
Repeal all subsidies.
Eliminate mandated benefits.
Eliminate taxes, do not abate them for certain groups.
Eliminate the abuse of Tax Increment Financing (TIF).
Sell all state agencies that duplicate services provided by businesses or charitable organizations.
Give responsibility for licensing drivers and vehicles over to auto insurers, including standards for vehicle inspections.
Abolish labor laws and allow employers and employees to freely enter into contracts.
Create jobs by eliminating red tape and licensing requirements on businesses.
JUSTICE
The purpose of our justice system is to protect individuals and their property, not serve as a revenue stream for the state and a mechanism to punish peaceful behavior.
Eliminate mandatory sentencing.
Restore Second Amendment rights.
Repeal statutes regarding victimless crimes.
Enact legislation supportive of victims’ rights and restitution.
Privatize prison and parole programs and demand accountability.
Add an explicit right to a Fully Informed Jury to the State Constitution.
Amend Missouri’s Constitution to require a ‘sunset clause’ for every new law.
Require criminals to make restitution to their victims as a condition of parole or early release.
Prohibit all jurisdictions from seizing property in connection with an alleged crime until such time as the accused is tried and convicted.
Require Prosecutors to produce actual victims in court as witnesses subject to cross examination when prosecuting so called victimless crimes.
PRIVACY
Privacy in one’s home, affairs and effects is a fundamental right of free people.
Define an explicit right to privacy in the Missouri Constitution.
Allow citizens to sue public officials individually and personally for violations of citizens’ rights.
Oppose implementation of the “Real ID Act,” which requires enhanced security for state driver’s licenses – essentially establishing a national ID card.
Oppose wire-tapping, drones, cameras and other surveillance technology by government entities without a properly executed search warrant.
Oppose any effort to regulate or prohibit peaceful practices in one’s medical, recreational, or other lifestyle decisions.
Allow consenting adults to marry and enter into other private contracts without requiring permission from any government entity.
PROPERTY RIGHTS AND EMINENT DOMAIN
Property rights are the foundation of liberty and enable a free market economy to flourish.
End the practice of using eminent domain powers to seize property for the benefit of private developers.
Repeal the ability of local governments to turn over condemnation authority to independent parties.
Eliminate the use of “blight” as a rationale for using eminent domain to seize private property.
Oppose the National Animal Identification System.
Oppose the use of government mandates to dictate the smoking policies of privately-owned businesses.
STATE SOVEREIGNTY
State sovereignty and the ability to nullify unconstitutional federal laws and mandates are protected by the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Support efforts to assert state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution for all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government under the Constitution.
Support nullification of the laws and mandates put forth by DEA, USDA, FDA, EPA and other federal regulatory agencies.
Allow the use of alternative currencies in Missouri.
TAXES
Taxes remove revenue by force from productive uses, allocating them less efficiently, and provide the resources for political corruption and cronyism.
Initiate ceilings on personal property taxes.
Repeal the state income tax provision of the Missouri Constitution.
All state and local government functions should, where possible, be funded by user fees.
By constitutional amendment require 75% voter approval for all tax increases or new taxes.
Pass enabling legislation to permit voters to repeal, and in the future prohibit sales taxes on food and prescription drugs for counties, municipalities and all other political entities in the state which have authority to levy sales taxes. This includes the state-wide 1% sales tax for public schools.

How Likely Am I to Need Long-Term Care?
If you were to suffer an illness or disability that required long-term nursing care, would you be covered?
Maybe not. The vast majority of Americans go through their lives reassuring themselves that it will never happen to them. However, if past trends continue, the estimated risk of a 65-year-old person needing some form of long-term care during their life is 70 percent and the estimate risk of entering a nursing home is approximately 50 percent.1
That means it could very well happen to you. And while nursing home costs vary from area to area, the average cost of a one-year stay in a private room in a nursing home in 2018 is $100,375.2
Medicaid, the joint federal and state program that covers medical bills for the needy, pays a substantial portion of long-term-care costs but usually only for those who are impoverished.
And Medicare is not paying much of the cost of long-term care. That’s why the elderly should not rely on Medicare for their long-term-care needs.
Clearly, long-term-care costs pose a real problem for the elderly and their families. Long-term-care insurance can help preserve your accumulated wealth and provide coverage in the event you need long-term care. This can go far in helping to address financial need during retirement.

Donald Trump in 2016, condemning Hillary Clinton for not using his phrase “radical Islamic Terrorism.”
“We're having problems with the Muslims coming into this country…You have to deal with the mosques, whether we like it or not.”
Donald Trump in 2016, commenting on mosques such as those where the New Zealand massacre took place.

Santa Monica Celebrates New Pico Neighborhood Library

Saturday’s event at the Pico Branch Library in Santa Monica was billed as a Grand Opening. So there were civic speeches, a ribbon-cutting moment, and appropriate fanfare, including taiko drummers.
All of this, though, was mostly for show. The new facility in Virginia Avenue Park has been open for two months, and no longer needs any introduction to the community.
[pullquote align=left]
“This makes such a big difference because it means that parents can walk out of their house and right into the library.” – Florence Benjamin, Pico Neighborhood resident
[/pullquote]
More than 25,000 visitors have already stopped by, and they haven’t just been admiring the building’s sleek, airy design. They’ve already checked out more than 30,000 items, including books, videos and music CDs.
But when a community resource is more than three decades in the making, and it’s the first new library branch in Santa Monica in more than 50 years, you can’t blame the city for wanting to throw a party.

So as young soccer players drilled on the nearby field, and the park’s Saturday Farmers Market was in full swing, community leaders gathered on a grassy section outside the new library to reflect on the long, collaborative effort that made the facility possible.
“It’s important to recognize the hard work and journey that it took to get this library open,” Oscar de la Torre told the small crowd. Torre, co-chair of the Pico Neighborhood Association, said that the need for a library in the Pico community was first identified back in 1983.
Pico resident Jorge Diaz, 10, catches us on some important reading during opening ceremonies of the Pico Branch library on Saturday.
He praised the facility as a resource that would help neighborhood youth “move their lives forward and have a better life.”
Florence Benjamin, a member of the park’s advisory board and a Pico resident for more than five decades, said that the opening of the library was yet another sign that the park is erasing the stigma of years past that it wasn’t safe to visit.
“Someone had to break that chain,” she said in an interview before the event. “This makes such a big difference because it means that parents can walk out of their house and right into the library.”
The design of the new facility, by Koning Eizenberg Architecture of Santa Monica, reflects a modern, digital sensibility. The focus here isn’t just on books. With reading tables, group study rooms, 20 computer stations and seating areas throughout, the new branch is a place that promotes just hanging out.
Gene Oppenheim, a member of Santa Monica’s Library Board, returns books at the Pico Branch’s automated system on Saturday.
Visitors on Saturday, kids especially, took right away to the concept, grabbing magazines and books and settling easily into the many comfy chairs throughout to catch up on their reading.
When patrons want to take a break from exploring library resources, the facility’s glass exteriors offer expansive views of the park to sit back and enjoy. The library’s pervasive glass provides plenty of natural lighting, one of the elements that earned the building high ratings for its sustainable features.
The library still functions as a traditional library in that is has plenty of resources that visitors can check out and explore at home.
The collection features 25,000 items and includes a Spanish language section. And when patrons are ready to return those items, electronic, do-it-yourself checkout stations that resemble ATMs will transform the normally mundane task into an experience that is more adventurous and fun.
Even though the paint has barely dried on the 7,800-foot-facility, there are a host of activities planned for this summer, including author events, film screenings, children and teen reading programs, and book group meetings.
Santa Monica’s new Director of Library Services, Maria Taesil Hudson Carpenter, barely three weeks on the job, helped preside over the opening ceremony.
The new Pico Branch library at Virginia Park has been open for two months and already has attracted more than 25,000 visitors.
“We need libraries now more than ever,” she said, beaming, as she prepared to enter the facility after helping cut the ribbon. “We have to be flexible and accommodate all sorts of users. We want to have the physical space and digital resources available.”
The project budget of $10.8 million actually includes two buildings: the branch facility and The Annex, an 818-square-foot community room that will be used to host library events and be available for rental for community events.
Nestled in between the Thelma Terry Building, teen center, the Farmers Market Zone and the park’s popular splash pad, the new library is further evidence that Virginia Avenue Park is emerging as one of the city’s most vibrant public resources.
“There is more to come,” says park advisory board member Benjamin. “I say look out and hold on to your seat.”

Washroom Blues!
I today want to divert the attention of blog readers towards something, which is obscurely placed in the society, not much into consideration, but parents of today are facing the problems and parents of tomorrow will deal with much exaggerated form.
Everybody wants to give their child best schooling available where can they learn good things and make good friends and excel in every field. Normally the school buildings of a kid in first standard and kids in 12th standard are same. Now this is what the issue of concern is!
Washrooms
Washrooms in schools narrate the stories around in the same way as the headlines in footer of news channels flash. I’ m sure they do the same everywhere!
School washrooms are full of encrypted names, quotes, wraths, rage, etc. Well yepp, this is the area where today’s blog post will throw light on. I was talking to one of my near and dear relative. And she is facing the washroom blues. By washroom blues I mean her 8 year old daughter has been absorbing the part of vocabulary, which she is expected to know in her mid or late teens. Courtesy: washrooms in her school. Of course when the building is common and children below 8 have to share their places with the teen youth, this is the outcome! Dodging the questions from 8 year old curious and persistent mind of a child is not only difficult but nearly invincible task. Explaining the meaning on the other hand is a problem in itself! Is the little mind ready to get exposure? Will it be able to digest it?
Is their any solution?
Buildings for different age groups should be divided, transport facilities can also be broken into groups for different ages, and knowledge should be imparted into teenage minds in a healthy and mature manner, and they should be make aware of the negative outcomes of scribbling the words not appropriate for small children. Lastly, washrooms can have stone walls or marble walls, where scribbling will not be easy, if it provides any solution. Imparting knowledge in a healthy way and at the right age is necessary to keep the young minds clean, to restore their innocence and to avoid maturity before time.

Duggan delivers preliminary budget for 2020
By Prudence Brighton, Sun Correspondent
Posted: 03/15/2019 06:35:32 AM EDT
DRACUT -- Town Manager Jim Duggan has submitted a preliminary budget of $79.7 million for the fiscal 2020 to the Board of Selectmen and the Finance Committee. This amount reflects a 2.4 percent increase from the fiscal 2019 budget.
The budget, as presented, is balanced and keeps services at the same level as this year's budget.
In his budget message, Duggan highlighted several factors that helped to shape his budget proposal.
He noted that town and regional economic conditions have shown some improvement. Construction associated with the improvement has resulted in some growth in revenues.
The cost of employee benefits is a big contributor to the fiscal 2020 budget. The benefits package includes a county retirement system, a Medicare matching program, and health-care benefits. The town's assessment for the county retirement system will increase a little over 11 percent in the coming year.
The budget calls for an increase of 1.6 percent over the current year.
The town is moving all town employees who use Dracut health to the Massachusetts Interlocal Insurance Association. Duggan said the town wants to continue with a "sustainable" model for the health care of town employees for active and retired employees.
The three principal, and perhaps most important, employee benefits the top provides are a retirement plan through the Middlesex County Retirement System, group health benefits, life and dental insurance program, and the Medicare Matching Program.

All are contributory programs. For fiscal 2020, the town's assessment for County Retirement is increasing by approximately 11.3 percent.
The town has moved to a new insurance plan operated by the MIIA must focus on reducing its unfunded liability The state has set an fiscal 2038 deadline for reducing the liability to zero, Duggan's report said. In January 2016, this liability stood at $60 million. The town has made progress toward this goal.
Because this is Dracut's first year with the MIIA, the town received a very competitive rate which Duggan hopes will continue, enabling an economic sustainability model.
The revenue for the fiscal 2020 budget comes from these sources: property taxes (property), state aid, local receipts, and fund transfers. The town is estimated to receive $57 million from taxes, $21 million in state aid. $1.2 million in local receipts, and $340,801 in fund transfers.

Billy Kovacs is going to lose.
Billy Kovacs is the future of the Democratic Party in Southern Arizona.
Reconciling those two truisms is the biggest challenge the party faces, here, statewide and nationally because they sure could use some fresh faces and new energy.
Republicans face a different set of challenges but one thing the Grand Ole Party has proven good at over the years is stocking its bench with candidates skilled at bringing the conservative gospel straight to voters.
Democrats?
Kovacs is one of seven Democratic candidate seeking the nomination to vie to replace U.S. Rep. Martha McSally and I use him as a proxy for all up-and-comers out in our corner of the desert who seem to terrify party leaders in D.C.
The Democratic Party in Tucson, statewide and nationally must figure out how to turn its bench and walk-ons into potential starters, lest it start placing want adds or figuring out how to clone Terry Goddard.
Kovacs is one of six Southern Arizonans who are struggling to stand out against the Northern Arizona transplant (and as a former Northern Arizona transplant myself, nothing but respect) Ann Kirkpatrick. The former congresswoman is in the crosshairs of former state Rep. Matt Heinz’s attacks for being a carpet-bagging Republican Lite. But Kirkpatrick has the money to bury Heinz because she has the establishment's support.
Thanks to our donors and sponsors for their support of local independent reporting. Join Sheila Tobias, Dawn Martin, and Richard Webster and contribute today!
The fact that Kirkpatrick won that support at all is the mind-bending news of this primary and it should send shockwaves through the local party. On some level there's absolutely nothing wrong with hiring from out of town. Business does it all the time. But someone from Tucson or Southern Arizona must be in a position to make a go of it next time.
Pima County Democratic voters have elected 11 state lawmakers, three county supervisors, seven city council members, a county attorney, county recorder and county superintendent of public instruction. If none were deemed to be able to take on Martha McSally (or her replacement) in a good Democratic year, then there is a big need for new blood.
Kovacs is making mistakes — the same mistakes every rookie makes — and the powers that be aren't to blame for that. He doesn’t have the money to get the message out to overtake Heinz trying to overtake Kirkpatrick. But he’s got the youth, charisma and smarts to make a dent in local politics and one day be “the guy” when the time comes. The powers that be will be to blame if they turn around in 2023 and say "we got no one" to make a race again without going to more Fred DuVals or retread Republicans.
Stefanie Mach had the chops. So did Tim Sultan. So did Brandon Patrick. Matt Kopec may not have been the most charismatic guy you ever met, but he worked his tail off. They left the arena and went on to other things (although Kopec's sliding back into the elected side of politics with a run for the Amphi school board). Democrats have a way of treating progressive comers as nuisances. And how they welcome Latino faces? Don’t even get me started.
This election cycle was going to be good for Democrats the moment Donald Trump was certified the winner in 2016. As sure as summer leads to monsoons, the party that wins the White House gets shellacked two years later. Pima County Democrats, being the stronghold of Democratic Party support in Arizona, should have had at the ready a candidate ready to give McSally a swashbuckling run.
Instead, a three-term but twice-losing candidate for federal office who moved to Tucson last year has become the front-runner for the seat.
Scouting the party
Locally, the Democratic Party has done a lot to get itself modern. First it built up its its base of legislative district chairpeople to establish something of a grassroots structure. Then it got real about fundraising and becoming more professional in terms of staffing.
But a party exists for one reason: To elect partisans. That means more than just finding candidates; it means grooming candidates.
I’m not talking about picking winners and losers during the primary process. I’m talking about recruiting and teaching candidates before they even take out their campaign paperwork. I’m talking about identifying among the current crop of elected officials, the ones best suited for moving up. Finding those new activists who should run for school boards. Making sure every precinct has its full slate of committemen.
The work that needed to be done to get someone ready to make the CD 2 race in 2018, should have been done in 2013.

Pima problems
Stepping-stone offices like sheriff, county attorney and mayor that typically feed congressional and statewide offices have been held in Tucson by Democrats like Clarence Dupnik, Barbara LaWall and Jonathan Rothschild — folks who've showed zero ambition to take the next step up.
Arizona's Clean Elections provisions relieve candidates of state offices from the burden of raising money above the $5 individual contributions required to gain public financing. So they don’t build up their own donor bases.
Safe Democratic districts socially promote progressives without having to get in a cage fight with real conservative challengers, thereby proving their electoral appeal beyond the party’s base. Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District contains four Legislative districts with 12 serving members. Eight are Democrats. Last cycle, just one election was close, with Republican state Rep. Todd Clodfelter ousting Mach in 2016 (something we will revisit).
The party honchos want Democrats to schmooze moderates and independents by denying any presence of a political conscience. They don’t want liberals being so silly as to try to win with progressive arguments. (I don’t care if it’s a liberal idea or a conservative idea, so long as it’s the right idea for the people of X." Sound familiar?) Republicans will preach their ideology anytime, anywhere and do so with enough confidence to win.
I’m going to say it’s a knowable unknown that a liberal message can win moderates and independents. Voters tend to favor clean air, safe drinking water, Social Security, Medicare, public schools, public lands, the minimum wage, student financial assistance, gun restrictions and Obamacare, all of a sudden.
It’s at the very least a fair fight against popular conservative ideas like balanced budgets, rule of law, free markets and a belief that being aggrieved is no way to get ahead. It’s more than a fair fight now that President Trump has convinced the Right those are stupid liberal ideas too.
What the Beltway wants
Candidates seeking to climb need help at both the local and national levels, but the locals who are hooked in with the national players consider themselves to be players, too — and players in progressive politics favor resumes over talent.
The perfect candidate, in their calculus, is a Latina who opened a successful shooting range after being discharged from the Marines after seeing combat overseas. A business person can’t be called pro-tax and won’t be tagged for wanting more regulation. A combat veteran won’t be hammered for a lack of patriotism. She will turn out the base without having to bend to their issues.
Progressive Latinos, of course, need not apply unless maybe they were registered Republicans just a few years back.
That’s borderline sexist and racist, while missing the point that Republicans would call Ayn Rand a socialist purveyor of permissive objectivism if her ghost ran for public office.
The worst candidate possible is a liberal, let alone a gay half-Lebanese liberal like Heinz whom the Left didn’t go out of its way to help as they begged the politically impaired Ron Barber to cling to life until his predictable political demise. Barber is a damn nice guy, but was an awful candidate. He was supposed to be a temporary placeholder but the gurus in Washington felt they needed him to keep running because they thought no one else in Southern Arizona could win.
What separates Kovacs and those like him from the real contenders isn’t a lack of talent but a lack of know-how and connections. There’s a nuts and bolts to campaigning and people aren’t born handy in the ways of politics. They also need access to money, which requires a whole bunch of hook-ups.
When the South rose
Once upon a time, a scouting unit would watch for young talent to groom.
The Southern Democratic Leadership Council rose up in reaction to Walter Mondale’s 49-state drubbing just 12 years after George McGovern’s 49-state drubbing.
The party saw the South as the route back to power but only if they could break the the northern lock on Kennedy liberalism. The SDLC leadership dropped the "Southern" part in the 1990s and became the DLC.
They scored successes at the state and national level, helping Bill Clinton get to the White House and providing a template demanded of swing district candidates that was very simple.
I found this priceless quote from a 2001 article in the American Prospect touting the DLC’s string of successes throughout the 1990s:
Thanks to our donors and sponsors for their support of local independent reporting. Join Ted Pace, Mark Kimble, and Olga Yiparaki and contribute today!
"Today's is not your father's Democratic Party. Though the dwindling chorus of party progressives provides counterpoint, today's Democrats are proud to claim the mantle of budgetary moderation. They oppose President Bush's $2-trillion tax-cut plan not by arguing mainly for more spending on health, education, and welfare, but because it risks the new sacred cause of paying off the national debt. They are the party of increased military spending, the death penalty, the war on drugs, and partnership with religious faith. They are the party of Ending Welfare As We Know It, the party of The Era of Big Government Is Over."
What? No protecting the American family from the gay agenda? The DLC did a great job repositioning the Democratic Party as the Republican Party with a bit more social conscience.
National Democrats haven't changed much in their approach to winning tight races but the rest of the party has moved on.
After pushing for the Iraq War and the kind of deregulation that brought down the banks, the DLC shuttered in 2011.
Looking for a hook-up
“True Progressives” can applaud that all they want but the DLC served a purpose.
The DLC scoured the political landscape for young leaders and hook them up with all sorts of help. In Southern Arizona, they found their woman in the early '00s. A businesswoman and, most important, a former Republican with connections to the Tucson business community. Gabby Giffords was a comer.
The political world made room for her. They helped her with connections. When a seat came open, she had nearly $300,000 in the bank within a month.
For his part, Kovacs jumped into the race early while other Democrats hemmed and hawed at the prospect of taking on McSally. He managed to bring in about $20,000 in his first two months. Great money for a Tucson City Council race but not enough to convince anyone he was a serious contender for a congressional run. When McSally bolted for the Senate campaign after Kirkpatrick entered the race, Kovacs' fundraising dried up.
Maybe here, progressives/liberals want to gripe about “legalized bribery” and the contamination of money in politics. Good. Fine. But there is a real world thing going on here that needs to be recognized.
What is the new Democratic Party’s answer, in its new liberalizing incarnation, to hooking candidates up for cash? Anything? There are organizations like “Swing Left” that has raised $4 million for primary winners in swing districts but that’s awfully late in the candidate recruitment process to count much. Small-dollar donations can pack a wallop, too, and there are groups trying that approach. Again, they are seeking to reward the candidate long after the real help is needed.
The Center for Progressive Leadership does offer some training and fellowships for “future leaders” but they take a broad approach to help fill staffing positions in liberal institutions and teach community organizing. That’s fine and all but it’s not retaining and grooming candidates.
From Sirhan With love
Which brings me to the rank-and-file needing to grow up some.
Thanks for reading TucsonSentinel.com. Tell your friends to follow us on Facebook and Twitter.
Democrats want to fall in love. They want passion. They want to walk passed the bumper sticker, look at the candidate’s name and feel it. They don’t want to hire someone to do the job they need done. They want the X factor.
I blame Sirhan Sirhan.
The man who murdered Robert F. Kennedy left a giant gaping promise never redeemed or never found to be a broken promise. Boomers passed the romanticism onto Gen Xers and somehow millennials still carry the infirmity.
The party isn’t in love with Heinz. It’s heart doesn’t skip a beat when Mary Matiella walks in the room. Bruce Wheeler is a nice guy … but …
Democrats here took out Matt Kopec in a 2016 legislative primary and then for reasons I can't even begin to understand didn't turn out for Stefanie Mach that November. Local voters never knock out incumbents but they chose to 86 Mach? The woman had a personal narrative so inspiring, she chafes at the idea that she's an inspiration. And that's the candidate a Democratic stronghold full of older voters looked at and said "eh, I bet she likes hip-hop."
It’s OK to “just be friends” with a candidate who shares most of your principles. The soul doesn’t have to dance. Republicans learned long ago it’s perfectly fine to hire a candidate to do a job without hoping they notice you from across the room.
Well, they did until Donald Trump came along and suddenly they are waiting to find out what they believe based on what Trump will tweet tomorrow morning.
Losing a race for Congress is no big obstacle to a future in elected office, especially if it's a primary. Ann Kirkpatrick lost a House election, and bounced back for two more terms. Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all lost a race for the House before working in an office without right angles. Twenty percent of U.S. presidents lost an election before finding themselves at that desk. Even the seemingly undefeatable Raul Grijalva lost his first bid for elective office. McSally lost a primary and a general election before eking out her first narrow win. Steve Farley lost a City Council primary before turning his sights on the Legislature (and now the governor's chair).
No matter what happens in 2018 or 2020, Democrats are going to need someone to run in 2022 and 2024. The time to start thinking about those races isn’t 2021 or 2023. There are Billy Kovacses out there ready to make the leap. Without some help now, they'll make that leap and lose. If the Dems let them wander off into oblivion, then Terry Goddard’s DNA will start looking good.

Correction: An earlier version of this column incorrectly reported the election cycle in which Kopec lost his primary race.

Brian,
All this may be true but they have no one local ready to take the next step up the ladder. Shasta was great. Don Jorgensen was very savvy. They are stuck with the resources they have to do the job they do. And they can’t do it alone. It can’t be done at the LD level all by your lonesome. It’s gotta be integrated.
Billy’s right. They need a pipeline and it needs attention from the state and national party, especially given how important this state portends to be in the future. We may be living in the Ohio of the late 20s.
And BTW, R’s need to figure out how to do all this at the local level because one party rule is bad for everyone.

Hi Larry, Here in your own words “Among the five serious candidates, Kovacs is the only one emphasizing the economy in Congressional District 2. As Bill Clinton pointed out in 1992, winning elections is about �the economy, stupid!�
“https://blogforarizona.net/billy-kovacs-5-point-plan-grow-arizonas-economy/”
Also written by you,
https://blogforarizona.net/kovacs-shines-and-kirkpatrick-gets-booed-at-cd2-congressional-candidates-forum/
Btw please check my FEC filings to take account for contributions made to my campaign from my family. My dad contributed less than $250 to my campaign, My mom is around $150, my brother is at $250, and my sister is at $100. In the land of reality where I live, I have contributed every check I’ve WORKED FOR over the last 16 months from Hotel Congress into my campaign. This amount has totalled over $40,000k. If you want I’ll send you my pay stubs to prove it. If you would like to argue these points with me I would invite you to sit down for some coffee as I would be happy to enlighten you. Thanks for calling me cute though? Weird, but I’ll take the backhanded compliment.

Brian, I ran Demion Clinco’s campaign in 2014 for State House and was his treasurer for his 2016 Pima Community College board campaign. I was also a 2016 Flinn-Brown Fellow at the Arizona Center for Civic Leadership. I took it upon myself to build the policy knowledge to run for office even though I was not seeking it at the time. The true problem is that we don’t have a bench of candidates ready to run for office. There is no pipeline for training, leadership development, and candidate prep to take on any level of elected office in Pima County. This is a fact, but we should learn from this mistake and start building the system up now and not sit here pointing fingers at each other.
Sorry, we missed your input...

CERTIFICATION - EPA | ENGINE FAMILY NUMBER | HOW TO FIND A UNIVERSAL CONVERTER
CATALYTIC CONVERTER INSTALLATION GUIDE ATTENTION: PROFESSIONAL INSTALLERS
In August, 1986 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued new proposed guidelines for the construction, efficiency and installation of aftermarket converters. The EPA guidelines state that replacement converters may be installed only in the following situations:
The vehicle is missing a converter.
A state or local inspection program has determined that the existing converter needs replacement.
The vehicle a 1995 or newer model that is more than eight years old or has more than 80,000 miles on it, and a legitimate need for replacement has been established and documented.
The installer must include the customer's name and address, the make, model, year and mileage of the vehicle on the service invoice, along with a stated reason for replacement. Where a state or local government has determined that a converter is damaged or needs replacement, the service or repair facility must retain a copy of the written statement or invoice. Where a proper state or local government representative has not been verified the replacement need, the customer and a representative of the service or repair facility must sign a statement verifying that replacement is justified.
That statement is printed on the following sheet which is included in every converter carton:
-IMPORTANT-
THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REQUIRES THAT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT BE READ AND SIGNED BY THE VEHICLE'S OWNER AND THE INSTALLER OF THE REPLACEMENT CATALYTIC CONVERTER.
Catalytic converters are emission control devices which are designed to last the life of the vehicle and do not normally require replacement. Furthermore, if the vehicle is properly used and maintained, original converters are covered by the emissions control warranty for eight years or 80,000 miles. Federal law prohibits repair businesses from replacing these devices except under certain limited circumstances.
In order to verify that the proper circumstances exist, the owner of the vehicle on which such repairs are made and a facility representative must sign the following statement.
The vehicle is a 1994 or older model and has more than 50,000 miles on it, or is a 1995 or newer model which is eight years old or has more than 80,000 miles on it, and the catalytic converter required replacement because .............................. or the vehicle's catalytic converter was missing when the vehicle arrived.
Vehicle Owner's Signature ..............................
Facility Representative's Signature ..............................
Date ..............................
The installer must retain this statement and a copy of the invoice for six months and the replaced converter (if any) for at least for 15 days from the date of installation of the replacement converter. The replaced converter must be marked in such a way that it can be identified with the customer invoice and this statement and be available for EPA inspections.
Furthermore, the EPA has issued the following installation requirements:
The converter be installed in one of the three situations outlined above.
The converter be installed in the same location as the original converter.
The converter be the same type as the original converter (i.e., oxidation, three-way or three-way plus oxidation).
The converter be the proper one for the vehicle application as determined and specified by the manufacturer.
The converter be connected properly to any existing air injection components on the vehicle.
The converter be installed with any other required converter for a particular application.
The converter be accompanied by a warranty information card to filled in by the installer.
Federal law prohibits removal or replacement of properly functioning OE catalytic converter.
IMPORTANT — ENGINE FAMILY NUMBER
To determine which catalytic converter to use on a vehicle, it is necessary to determine the specific vehicle emission system that was installed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer. This information is included on the Vehicle Emission Control Information label required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (see examples below). This label is located in the engine compartment in a visible position on the hood underside, strut tower, radiator support, fan shroud, or firewall. The label will provide the Emission Family Number (EFN, also known as the Engine Family code or Test Group Number) and other important emission specifications. All applications in this catalog refer to the EFN. Be sure to verify your EFN in order to avoid misapplication of the catalytic converters in this catalog. If the label is missing, it is necessary to contact the OE dealer for the information, or to order a new Emission Control Information Label.
HOW TO FIND A UNIVERSAL CONVERTER IF NOT LISTED IN APPLICATION SECTION
IMPORTANT: If the vehicle is registered in the state of California, the catalytic converter must be selected from the California converter catalog.
Note: All vehicles that are NOT registered in the state of California may use this catalog to select a catalytic converter. This includes California Emission vehicles that are registered in states other than California. This also includes vehicles registered in Canada.
If you do not find your vehicle listed in the application section of this catalog, you may select a universal converter to repair your vehicle by following these steps. Universal converters require custom fabrication to fit them into the exhaust system. This type of work requires higher than average skills and is not recommended as a "Do it yourself" repair for most consumers.
Step 1: Determine required body size. ➊
Step 2: Determine the pipe size required ➋
Step 3: Determine any additional features required such as oxygen sensor fittings, dual inlet pipes, etc. ➌
Step 4: Determine whether a standard converter or Ultra converter is required. Standard converters are recommended for 1995 and older vehicles that are in good working order. Ultra converters are recommended for OBDII vehicles (1996 and newer models), or non-EGR vehicles with excessive NOx. ➍
Step 5: Choose a converter rated for your engine size. Engine displacements listed for universal converters are the maximum allowed engine size for the converter. The vehicle must have the same size engine or a smaller engine than the engine size listed for the universal converter. ➎
Step 6: Choose a converter rated for your vehicle weight. Look at the manufacturer's label on the driver's side door pillar to find the vehicle's Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (G.V.W.R.). The vehicle must have the same G.V.W.R. or smaller than the G.V.W.R. listed for the converter. ➏
Step 7: Choose the appropriate converter Type. Vehicles have catalytic converters that operate as either Three-Way, Three-Way plus Oxidation, or Oxidation types. Look at the emission label in the engine compartment of the vehicle to determine what type of converters are used. Most universal converters have been designed to work in place of multiple types of catalysts. The chart below shows common abbreviations of catalyst types shown on the vehicle emission label: ➐
Catalyst Type
Oxidation
Three-Way
Three-Way plus Oxidation
Abbreviations COC
OC
OX
OXD
CAT TWC
3CL
3WY TWC+OC
TWC+OX
(note: All Three-Way plus Oxidation converters will have an air tube, and any converter with an air tube is a Three-Way plus Oxidation converter.)

How Just 10 States Saved Almost $120 Billion in 2015 Using Generic Drugs
By Jon C. Ogg	October 20, 2016 12:25 pm EDT

Tweet
It is no secret that the health care system in America needs help. Treatment costs have gone through the roof over the past two decades, and there is an ongoing debate over just how good the health care is for the money that gets spent. There is a common thread in America that seems to be true regardless of which side of the political aisle voters fall on. Americans generally would like to spend less money on health care. One way that this can be and will be accomplished is through the continued use and expanded use of generic drugs.
When drugs go off-patent, competing drug makers are free to launch generic drugs. This often takes those brand drug sales from having hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in annual revenues down to the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
The QuintilesIMS Institute, on behalf of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, has released the 2016 Generic Drug Savings and Access in the United States. Clearly this report is a pro-generic drug by design. That caveat aside, 24/7 Wall St. still wanted to see what the represented savings might be. The report shows a shocking number, that generic savings reached $227 billion in 2015 — and that generic drugs saved $1.46 trillion in a 10-year period (2006 to 2015).
24/7 Wall St. looked through this report and its map on a state-by-state basis. It turns out that just 10 states were projected to have saved almost $120 billion (see table below) of that total national $227 billion in savings in 2015 alone.
The report shows how vast the use of generic drugs is, versus how little of the total pie of pharmaceutical spending. It says:
Nearly 3.9 billion of the total 4.4 billion prescriptions dispensed in the United States are for generics. Generics make up 89% of prescriptions dispensed but only 27% of total medicine spending. Put another way, brand drugs are 11% of prescriptions and responsible for 73% of drug costs.
As you might expect, the larger the state, the larger the savings for generics. That means that California, New York, Texas and other large states dominate the savings. Still, just 10 states of the entire 50 came to over $119 billion (see table below) and made up over 50% of the entire savings for the whole country by using generic drugs. If you want to know just some of the blockbuster branded drugs that have gone off patent in recent years, they are Oxycontin, Nexium, Cymbalta, Celebrex, Abilify, Copaxone, Gleevec, Neulasta, Crestor and many more.
One issue that stood out handily was the savings in Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare savings alone of $67.6 billion in 2015 were represented as translating to savings of $1,737 per enrollee. The Medicaid savings of $32.7 billion were represented as saving $450 per enrollee in 2015. That isn’t chump change by any measurement.
The methodology for how each state saved money was based upon Medicaid, Medicare, cash (non-insured) and commercial insured. These have been included for each state as well and were taken directly from the report. Here are 10 states that made up over half of all generic drug savings in 2015.
1. California Total 2015 Savings: $20.1 billion
> Medicaid: $3.6 billion
> Medicare: $6.4 billion
> Cash (Non-Insured) $1.1 billion
> Commercial Insured: $8.9 billion
2. New York Total 2015 Savings: $19.2 billion
> Medicaid: $4.4 billion
> Medicare: $6.1 billion
> Cash (Non-Insured) $692 million
> Commercial Insured: $7.9 billion

A South Korean multinational electronics company, LG Electronics, is looking into possibilities of establishing an assembly plant in Tanzania to tap into rising middle class consumers and reach the East African region.
LG Electronics General Manager for East Africa, Moses Marji said at the ongoing 42th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair that Tanzania was an important growing market for the company and its strategic location facilitate reaching the East African regional market.
"There are various issues that we have to take into consideration before coming up with a decision to invest because as of now the country is going through a transition including change in laws and other key elements in the investment sector, therefore we will have our decision based on all those issues in the end," he said.
He said what matters most is the quality of products and the intended factory to be established will bring into reality the idea to use home made products. It was crucial to establish the plant in the country so that the customers could feel that they use their own products, he said.
The electronics multinational which posted biggestever revenue in 2017, despite falling smartphone sales, is currently participating in the ongoing 42th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair where it has introduced new products that have entered the market from their fleet.
The South Korea's tech behemoth, posted its biggest-ever revenue in history in 2017 due mainly to strong TV sales. Revenue reached record high $57.9 billion in 2017 for the first time in the company's 60-year history, according to Xinhua news agency.
The mobile communications division, which makes smartphones, posted an operating loss of $201 million in the fourth quarter on high marketing costs and higher component prices.

Vanessa Beeley Talks Powerfully on the Gilet Jaunes Movement in France February 12, 2019
By Noam Chomsky (Philospohy Now)
Noam Chomsky winner of this year’s Philosophy Now Award for contributions in the fight against stupidity . The Award was presented on Tuesday 27th January 2015
Naturally I am very pleased to be granted this honour, and to be able to accept this award also in the name of my colleague Edward Herman, the co-author of Manufacturing Consent, who himself has done a great deal of outstanding work on this crucial topic. Of course, we’re not the first people to have addressed it.
Predictably, one of the earlier ones was George Orwell. He’s written a not very well known essay that is the introduction of his famous book Animal Farm. It’s not known because it wasn’t published – it was found decades later in his unpublished papers, but it is now available. In this essay he points out that Animal Farm is obviously a satire on the totalitarian enemy; but he urges people in free England to not feel too self-righteous about that, because as he puts it, in England, unpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of force. He goes on to give examples of what he means, and only a few sentences of explanation, but I think they’re to the point.
One reason, he says, is that the press is owned by wealthy men who have every interest in not having certain ideas expressed. His second is a interesting point, that we didn’t go into but should have: a good education. If you go to the best schools you have instilled into you the understanding that there are certain things it just wouldn’t do to say. That, Orwell claims, is a powerful hook that goes well beyond the influence of the media.
Stupidity comes in many forms. I’d like to say a few words on one particular form that I think may be the most troubling of all. We might call it ‘institutional stupidity’. It’s a kind of stupidity that’s entirely rational within the framework within which it operates: but the framework itself ranges from grotesque to virtual insanity.
Instead of trying to explain it, it may be more helpful to mention a couple of examples to illustrate what I mean. Thirty years ago, in the early eighties – the early Reagan years – I wrote an article called ‘The Rationality of Collective Suicide’. It was concerned with nuclear strategy, and was about how perfectly intelligent people were designing a course of collective suicide in ways that were reasonable within their framework of geostrategic analysis.
I did not know at the time quite how bad the situation was. We have learnt a lot since. For instance, a recent issue of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists presents a study of false alarms from the automatic detection systems the US and others use to detect incoming missile attacks and other threats that could be perceived as nuclear attack. The study ran from 1977 to 1983, and it estimates that during this period there were a minimum of about 50 such false alarms, and a maximum of about 255. These were alarms aborted by human intervention, preventing disaster by a matter of a few minutes.
It’s plausible to assume that nothing substantial has changed since then. But it actually gets much worse – which I also did not understand at the time of writing the book.
In 1983, at about the time I was writing it, there was a major war scare. This was in part due to what George Kennan, the eminent diplomat, at the time called “the unfailing characteristics of the march towards war – that, and nothing else.” It was initiated by programs the Reagan administration undertook as soon as Reagan came into office. They were interested in probing Russian defences, so they simulated air and naval attacks on Russia.
This was a time of great tension. US Pershing missiles had been installed in Western Europe, with a flight time of about five to ten minutes to Moscow. Reagan also announced his ‘Star Wars’ program, understood by strategists on both sides to be a first strike weapon. In 1983, Operation Able Archer included a practice that “took Nato forces through a full-scale simulated release of nuclear weapons.” The KGB, we have learnt from recent archival material, concluded that armed American forces had been placed on alert, and might even have begun the countdown to war.
The world has not quite reached the edge of the nuclear abyss; but during 1983, it had, without realizing it, come frighteningly close – certainly closer than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The Russian leadership believed that the US was preparing a first strike, and might well have launched a preemptive strike. I am actually quoting from a recent US high-level intelligence analysis, which concludes that the war scare was for real. The analysis points out that in the background was the Russians’ enduring memory of Operation Barbarossa, the German code-name for Hitler’s 1941 attack on the Soviet Union, which was the worst military disaster in Russian history, and came very close to destroying the country. The US analysis says that was exactly what the Russians were comparing the situation to.
That’s bad enough, but it gets still worse. About a year ago we learned that right in the midst of these world-threatening developments, Russia’s early-warning system – similar to the West’s, but much more inefficient – detected an incoming missile strike from the US and sent off the highest-level alert. The protocol for the Soviet military was to retaliate with a nuclear strike. But the order has to pass through a human being. The duty officer, a man named Stanislav Petrov, decided to disobey orders and not to report the warning to his superiors. He received an official reprimand. But thanks to his dereliction of duty, we’re now alive to talk about it.
We know of a huge number of false alarms on the US side. The Soviet systems were far worse. Now nuclear systems are being modernised.
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists have a famous Doomsday Clock, and they recently advanced it two minutes. They explain that the clock “ticks now at three minutes to midnight because international leaders are failing to perform their most important duty, ensuring and preserving the health and vitality of human civilisation.”
Individually, these international leaders are certainly not stupid. However, in their institutional capacity their stupidity is lethal in its implications. Looking over the record since the first – and so far only – atomic attack, it’s a miracle that we’ve escaped.
Nuclear destruction is one of the two major threats to survival, and a very real one. The second, of course, is environmental catastrophe.
There’s a well-known professional services group at PricewaterhouseCoopers who have just released their annual study of the priorities of CEOs. At the top of the list is over-regulation. The report says that climate change did not make it into the top nineteen. Again, the CEOs are doubtless not stupid individuals. Presumably they run their businesses intelligently. But the institutional stupidity is colossal, literally life-threatening for the species.
Individual stupidity can be remedied, but institutional stupidity is much more resistant to change. At this stage of human society, it truly endangers our survival. That’s why I think institutional stupidity should be a prime concern.
Thank you.
Questions From The Audience:
How could we overcome media propaganda and improve the media? Through education?
This is an old debate. In the US it has been debated for over a century within the framework of the First Amendment to the US Constitution, which bars government action from preventing publication. Notice that it doesn’t protect freedom of speech, nor block punishment for speech.
There weren’t really many cases dealing with the First Amendment up until the Twentieth Century. The American press were very free previously, and there were a wide variety of all kinds of media: journals, magazines, pamphlets. The Founding Fathers believed in the freedom of information, and there were many efforts to stimulate the widest possible range of independent media. Freedom of speech, however, was not strongly protected.
Decisions on free speech began to be made around the First World War, but not by the courts. It wasn’t until the 1960s that the US established a high level of protection of freedom of speech. Meanwhile in the interwar period there was extensive discussion within the framework of what has been called ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ freedom, after Isaiah Berlin, of what the First Amendment implies about freedom of expression and of the press. There was a view sometimes called ‘corporate libertarianism’, which held that the First Amendment should concern negative freedom: that is the government can’t interfere with the right of media owners to do what they want. The other view was social democratic, and came out of the New Deal after the Depression and the early post-WWII period. That view held that there should also be positive freedom: in other words, that people should have the right to information as the basis for a democratic society. That battle was waged in the 1940s, and corporate libertarianism won. The US is unusual in this respect. There’s nothing like the BBC in the US. Most countries have some kind of national media which are as free as the society is. The US whacks that to the margins. The media were basically handed over to private power to exercise their capacities as they choose. That’s an interpretation of freedom of expression in terms of negative freedom: the state can’t intervene to affect what the private owners decide to do. There are a few restrictions, but not much. The consequences are pretty much a control of ideas as Orwell describes, and Edward Herman and I discuss this in great detail.
How do you overcome it? One way is education; but another way is by returning to the concept of positive freedom, which means recognising that in a democratic society we put a high value on the right of citizens to have access to a wide range of opinions and beliefs. That would, in the US, mean going back to what was in effect the earliest conception of the founders of the Republic, that there should be, not so much government regulation of what is said, but rather government support for a wide variety of opinions, news-gathering and interpretation – which can be stimulated in many ways.
Government means public: in a democratic society, government ought not to be some Leviathan making decisions. There are major grassroots projects that are trying to develop a more democratic media. This is a big battle because of the enormous power of the concentrated capital that of course tries to impede this in every possible way. But it’s a battle that has been going on for a long time, and there are fundamental issues at stake, including the issues of negative and positive freedoms.
Do you have any thoughts about the impact of search algorithms and search bubbles on the individual’s attempts to find information in their attempts to subvert Big Media?
Like all of you, I use search engines all the time. For people who are sufficiently privileged, the internet is very useful; but it’s usefulness is roughly to the extent that you do have privilege. ‘Privileged’ here means education, resources, a background ability to know what to look for.
It’s like a library. Suppose you decide ‘I want to be a biologist’, and so you join the Harvard Biology Library. Everything is in there, so in principle you can become a biologist; but of course it’s useless if you don’t know what to look for, and don’t know how to interpret what you see, and so on. It’s the same with the internet. There’s a huge amount of material out there – some valuable and some not – but it takes understanding, interpretation and background even to know what to look for. That’s quite apart from the fact that the Google system, for instance, is not a neutral system. It reflects advertiser interests in determining what’s prominent and what isn’t, and you have to know how to work your way through this maze. So it’s back to education and organisation enabling you to proceed.
I should stress that as an individual, you’re pretty limited in what you can come to understand, what ideas you can develop, how to think, even. So if you’re isolated, that highly restricts your ability to have and evaluate ideas, either in becoming a creative scientist or a functioning citizen. That’s one reason why the labor movement has always been at the forefront against information suppression, with workers education programs, for example, which were once extremely influential in both the UK and the US. The decline of what sociologists call ‘secondary associations’, where people come together to search and inquire, is one of the processes of atomisation which lead to people being isolated and facing this mass of information alone. So, the net’s a valuable tool, but as with all tools, you have to be in a position to be able to use it, and that’s not so simple. It requires significant social development.
How might it be possible to make institutions less stupid?
Well, it depends on what the institution is. I mentioned two: one is the government in control of a nuclear capacity; the other is the private sector, which is pretty much controlled through rather narrow concentrations of capital. They require different approaches. With regard to the government situation, this requires developing a functioning democratic society, in which an informed citizenry would play a central role in determining policy. The public is not in favour of facing death and destruction from nuclear weapons, and in this case we know in principle how to eliminate the threat. If the public were involved in developing security policy, I think this institutional stupidity could be overcome.
There’s a thesis in international relations theory that the prime concern of states is security. But that leaves open the question: Security for whom? If you look closely, it turns out it’s not security of the population, it’s security for privileged sectors within the society – the sectors who hold state power. There’s overwhelming evidence for this, which unfortunately I don’t have time to review. So one thing to do is to come to an understanding of whose security the state is in fact protecting: it’s not your security. It can be tackled by building a functioning democratic society.
On the issue of the concentration of private power, there’s also basically a problem of democratisation. A corporation is a tyranny. It’s the purest example of a tyranny you can imagine: power resides at the top, orders are sent down stage by stage, and at the very bottom, you have the option of purchasing what it produces. The population, the so-called stakeholders in the community, have almost no role in deciding what this entity does. And these entities have been granted extraordinary powers and rights, way beyond those of the individual. But none of it is graven in stone. None of it lies in economic theory. This situation is the result of, basically, class struggle, carried out by highly class-conscious business classes over a long period, which have now established their effective domination over society in various forms. But it doesn’t have to exist, it can change. Again, that’s a matter of democratising the institutions of social, political, and economic life. Easy to say, hard to do, but I think essential.

About BSNews
‘BS’ (short for ‘bullshit’) is the ironic title we have chosen to express our frustration with the corporate and political bias in the mainstream media (MSM). This systemic bias is summed up by the ’Propaganda Model’ advanced by Noam Chomksy and Edward Herman in their must-read book, ‘Manufacturing Consent’.
Why is it so important to draw attention to this? Because the consequences of such distortion can be measured in the suffering and deaths of millions of people who become the victims of our wars waged on the back of fabricated public assent. Thoreau said, we ‘must do justice, cost what it may’. Let us, then, insist on honesty and humanity above profit and power. Let’s breathe the fresh air of truth, however painful that may be.

By the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 256 points to hit 23,787
Apple shares finished nearly 2% higher after CEO Tim Cook took steps to appease jittery investors
US stocks closed higher on Tuesday for the third consecutive trading session as investors grew hopeful that the US and China will strike a trade pact.
By the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 256 points higher to hit 23,787 while the tech-laden Nasdaq climbed 74 points to finish at 6,897.
The market momentum came on news that China and the US are locked in negotiations to repair their ongoing trade spat. The world’s two biggest economies will continue trade discussions in Beijing for a third day, according to a Reuters report.
The S&P industrials sector, which tracks companies exposed to international trade concerns, jumped 1.4% on the progress in Beijing. And Boeing (NYSE:BA) performed particularly well, adding 3.79% to finish at $340.53 after the aircraft maker said it broke a record by delivering 806 aircraft last year.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) also finished nearly 2% higher to hit $150.75 after CEO Tim Cook took steps to appease investors who remain unhappy about Apple’s recent move to cut its quarterly revenue forecast. In a CNBC interview with Jim Cramer, Cook said Apple’s ecosystem of phones, tablets and computers is “probably underappreciated”.
The cheer surrounding Apple extended to other tech stocks, with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) gaining 1.7% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) adding 3.2%.
Elsewhere, the S&P 500 added 24 points to finish at 2,574 while the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks popped by 21 points to end at 1,426.
Up in Canada, Toronto’s TSX rose 101 points to close at 14,605.
12:55 PM: Dow Jones index posts triple-digit gain on China trade talk progress
US stocks rose Tuesday on progress cited by the US and China in trade discussions, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting triple-digit gains.
In early-afternoon trading, the Dow climbed 224.49 points, or 1%, to 23,758.84. The Nasdaq advanced 0.7% to 6,868.38.
The market was looking ahead to President Donald Trump’s Tuesday evening address to the American people on the partial government shutdown. It was.triggered by a clash with Democrats over his demand for money to build a border wall. The impasse is in its third week.
Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) was the best performer among the blue chips, climbing 3.7% to $339.89 on the trade talks' progress. Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) advanced 1.7% to $130.37. Both companies count China as a major customer.
The broader-based S&P 500 Index increased 0.6% to 2,565.70.
Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP) surged 8.6% to $150.51 after appointing a veteran rail executive, Jim Vena, as chief operating officer.
Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX) advanced 1.2% to $34.83 after reporting preliminary fourth-quarter sales figures that were in line with the consensus estimate of analysts.
Small-caps had a good day, with the Russell 2000 index climbing 1% to 1,419.90.
In Canada, the S&P/TSX Composite Index edged up 0.4% to 14,560.08.
9:45AM: US stocks build on gains on optimism over US-China trade talks
US stocks got off to a positive start Tuesday, as investors hoped for a third-straight session of wins backed by optimism over trade talks between the United States and China.
All the major stock indexes were deep in the green on the back of a broad rally.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index added 268.41 points, or 1.14% to 23,799.76 led higher by Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc and United Health Group, which all climbed nearly 2%.
The S&P 500 climbed nearly 1% to 2,573.88, led higher by Union Pacific Corp which shot up 9% after the top US railroad named industry veteran Jim Vena as chief operating officer, prompting upgrades by several brokerages.
Meanwhile, the tech-laden Nasdaq added 80.70 points, or 1.18% to 6,904.17 points.
The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks climbed 0.87% to 1,417.56.
7:17AM: Wall Street seen starting higher but tech worries back on the agenda
Wall Street shares are seen starting higher after a positive close yesterday, while European benchmarks are also up, despite more negative vibes in the tech sector.
South Korean giant Samsung has warned that fourth-quarter operating profit is poised to plunge nearly 30% compared to last year.
Majority of Wall Street pros see a stock market comeback led by tech in 2019: CNBC survey https://t.co/TjpGKFvN5I
— CNBC (@CNBC) 7 January 2019
It comes after shock news last week that CEO Tim Cook's behemoth Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was facing lower iPhones sales than previously expected, mainly because of an economic slowdown in China - which is a vital hub of global trade.
US stocks closed on Monday higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose over 98 points to hit 23,531, adding to gains from last week that followed dovish comments from the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
The Nasdaq closed up over 84 at 6,823 and the S&P 500 added almost 18 points at 2,549.
Futures trade is also up. The Dow Jones is up 153 points, while the Nasdaq is up over 38 points, while the S&P 500 is ahead by around 15 points.
In European stocks, FTSE 100 is ahead by over 68 points at 6,879. The German DAX is up 82 and the French CAC 40 is ahead by over 65 at 4,784.
Connor Campbell, analyst at spreadbetter Spreadex.com, said: "With the prospect of a decent US open on the horizon, the European markets levelled up their gains as Tuesday lunchtime approached.
"Holding out for a positive resolution to the ongoing trade talks between the US and China, the FTSE added 70 points, touching 6880 for the first time in almost 4 weeks," he noted.

Millburn, New Jersey — Pop. 20,488

Job Location
Millburn, New Jersey
The New York Times said … Millburn, N.J. … Its northern section, known as Short Hills, gives its name to an upscale shopping center, the Mall at Short Hills. The residential area of Short Hills is characterized by winding, hilly roads, bordered by thick stands of oaks. Behind them, often shielded from public view by sumptuous flower gardens, are some of the country’s best examples of 19th-century residential architecture. The rest of the town, known as the Millburn section, is laid out more conventionally, with neat streets and a mixture of building styles — small turn-of-the-century workers’ houses, Victorians, Tudors, Cape Cods and 1950’s ranches and colonials — on smaller lots, some just 36 feet wide. Millburn owes its name to Samuel Campbell, a Scottish immigrant who built a paper mill along the Rahway River in 1790, on what is now Brookside Drive. Using the Scottish term burn, which means stream, he called his factory the Mill-on-the-Burn, and that name was adapted to Millburn when the township split from neighboring Springfield in 1857.

Bearaxe, Afrocop, High Pulp
With the release of their debut EP “Last Call” earlier this year, blues-rock quartet Bearaxe joined Seattle’s au courant class of fierce-woman-fronted rock bands. Lead singer Shaina Shepherd’s towering vocals are embellished by scorching lead guitar and a hard-charging rhythm section. Also on the bill is Afrocop, a remarkably confident trio that plays lustrous psychedelic jazz that would work equally well in concert-hall recitals or blacklight-lit vape sessions. Finally, High Pulp is a young, raucous and ambitious 10-piece instrumental funk unit. Like Bearaxe, it broke out big this year by winning audiences one high-energy live show at a time. –J.Z.
If you go: Chop Suey, Jan. 3 at 8 p.m. ($8-$10; 21 and older)
On Her Shoulders
This moving documentary by Alexandria Bombach tells two stories. One is about Nadia Murad, the Iraqi woman who survived the Yazidi genocide in 2014 only to be kept as a sex slave by ISIS. After her escape, she landed in a refugee camp in Germany and later became a U.N. goodwill ambassador, speaking around the world about human trafficking. This year, she earned a Nobel Peace Prize for her work raising awareness about human rights violations. The other story — the one that takes this doc from traditional portrait to something well beyond — is about the toll sudden political fame takes on Murad, who went from enslaved young woman to Amal Clooney’s highly publicized client in just a couple years. The pressure for her to be “the spokeswoman” for her community, and to condense her harrowing story down to a sound bite perfectly honed for media consumption, is palpable and wrenching. –B.D.
If you go: Northwest Film Forum, Jan. 4-10, times vary. ($7-$12)
Mick Jenkins
Among the torrent of hip-hop talent bursting out of Chicago, Mick Jenkins is something like the city’s conscience, an experimentalist and craftsman with a powerful drive toward self-interrogation. The 27-year-old MC released his second album, Pieces of a Man, just last month; its title and introspective tone are a nod to iconic iconoclast Gil Scott-Heron. But Jenkins is no classicist — as he addresses contemporary topics like sexual consent, religious skepticism and poverty, he partners with forward-thinking producers like Montreal-based wunderkind Kaytranada, Detroit veteran Black Milk and prog-jazz quartet Badbadnotgood. His live band often includes a drummer, guitarist/backing vocalist and laptop producer, setting the stage for a night as musical as it is intellectual. –J.Z.
If you go: Neumos, Jan. 6 at 8 p.m. ($20-$22; all ages)

David Shields: Nobody Hates Trump More Than Trump: An Intervention
Critics have called it “a compelling book offering something to offend nearly anyone” (Kirkus), “recklessly and unpredictably full of insight” (Buffalo Review), and “a sobering, nuanced, and … brutally funny psychological investigation into why Trump resonates with all, even the people who hate him” (The Rumpus). Who better than University of Washington professor, prolific author and notorious contrarian David Shields to delve into the motivations of President Trump in a way that confounds and delights citizens of all stripes? “I’m determined to figure out what Donald Trump’s original wound is,” Shields says in his prologue. The result is part pop-psychological profile, part cultural criticism, part compilation of Trump quotes and, overall, a page turner. Hear what else his investigation turned up when he reads at Elliott Bay Books. –B.D.
If you go: Elliott Bay Books, Jan. 7 at 7 p.m. (Free)
All Star Opera: Seattle World Tour
Straight-up one of the most lovable bands in Seattle, All Star Opera embarks on its second-annual “World Tour” of the city, stopping at five different venues in five different neighborhoods over five successive nights. As if the band’s melodic, soul-drenched live hip-hop music and clever, high-concept music videos aren’t endearing enough (they are), the sextet will donate their earnings from this nano-tour to Mary’s Place and No Child Sleeps Outside while holding a clothing drive at each venue. Plus, every show features handpicked openers representing some of the strongest talent in the city, including Sendai Era, MistaDC, Cuff Lynx, Kung Foo Grip, Tres Leches and more. –J.Z.
If you go: All Star Opera “World Tour,” Jan. 8-12, venues, times and prices vary.

Laura Castellanos: Bodega (Love Materials)
There’s something a little dangerous vibrating in the work of Seattle visual artist Laura Castellanos. Lines and patterns repeated to the point of double vision, electric color against black backgrounds, cartoony faces that might just be hypnotizing you the longer you look. She brings all her mysterious “brujita” powers to play in her newest show, Bodega (Love Materials), which takes viewers down her own memory lane and into a shop her Cuban grandparents owned in the 1960s. With paintings, hand puppets, voodoolike dolls and other art objects, she has transformed the gallery into something that resembles a combination art shop and paint-splashed, interactive studio — a showcase of the many ways she channels her startling vision. –B.D.
If you go: ArtXchange Gallery through Jan. 26. Artist will attend for First Thursday festivities Jan. 3, 5-8 p.m. (Free)

'The Oath' Teaser: Ike Barinholtz, Tiffany Haddish Comedy Serves Up Thanksgiving Fracas
She is just the latest big-name comic to get a Netflix special as the streamer continues to roll out performances by the likes of Dave Chappelle, Jerry Seinfeld, Ellen DeGeneres, Chris Rock and Kevin James along with the special Def Comedy Jam 25.
“Tiffany Haddish is a force,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP Original Documentary and Comedy at Netflix. “Hilariously funny, brash and self-effacing, she’s an incredible artist who is winning over audiences while breaking barriers, and we are tremendously proud that she will showcase her formidable talent on Netflix.”
The streaming service locked up Haddish’s voice talents in February, announcing that she will star in the toon series Tuca & Bertie. Ali Wong, whose own Netflix stand-up special bowed in May, co-stars in the series.
After breaking out with her performance in last year’s hit pic Girls Trip, Haddish stars opposite Tracy Morgan in TBS’ The Last O.G. She also appeared on the big screen in this summer’s Uncle Drew and next up on the feature side are Night School with Kevin Hart, The Oath and Nobody’s Fool.

Tariffs May Stop High Country E-Bike Company In Its Tracks
September 19, 2018 at 5:15 pm
Filed Under:Donald Trump, Tariffs, Vail Valley, Wildsyde Vintage E-Bikes
By Matt Kroschel
EAGLE COUNTY, Colo. (CBS4) – New rounds of tariffs may spell the end of the bike path for one Colorado e-bike small business startup. The new company is filling a niche market with its shinny, new Wildsyde Vintage e-Cruiser e-bikes.
(credit: CBS)
Paul Hields worked hard to pull off what many people fail at doing: building a brand and securing a factory to make his product.
The beefy bikes have an electric motor to help make the ride a little easier.
(credit: CBS)
The threat of the newly-announced tariffs mean the small Colorado startup has two price lists. One for bikes already in stores and one they bring in after tariffs take effect.
“These tariffs are going to hurt our startup. They could make it a non-starter to tell you the truth,” Hields told CBS4’s Matt Kroschel. They spoke over FaceTime as he manned a booth at a bike trade show in Reno, Nevada.
Paul Hields (credit: CBS)
The Vail Valley entrepreneur shared his frustrations with something totally out of his control.
“We are hoping that they won’t be implemented, but right now, the tariff is on electric bicycles, regular bicycles, and bicycle components. We’re seeing price increases,” he explained. “I decided I was going to build a brand around this because these bikes are head turners. They’re very cool looking. They’re fun to ride.”
(credit: CBS)
Hields explained that since there aren’t any American companies making e-bike parts, he went to a factory in China. Now, that decision is causing extra stress with the Trump administrations’ planned 25 percent tariffs on bike and e-bikes coming from China.
“The comforting factors is we’re not the only people that are having to increase our bikes by 20-25 percent. We tried to soften the blow a little bit for our retailers. We’ve actually absorbed some of that margin.”
(credit: CBS)
Tariffs mean the normally $3,000 bikes will cost an extra $500.
“As a manufacturer, I’m in the middle of that. I won’t be selling as many bicycles. We hope these tariffs are short-lived. We hope the government will come to an agreement.”
For this Vail Valley company. it’s a waiting game, but they do worry this could stop them mid-pedal.

Matt, your old journalism teacher here. Please ask someone to spell “shiny” (“shy-nee”) not shinny (“shin-nee). And thanks for putting a local face to an international problem. Good job!

China has had huge tariffs on American goods, the goal is no tariffs. By putting ever increasing tariffs on China it will eventually force China to agree both sides eliminate or reduce tariffs. Its only 10% now and hopefully China will see the light before Jan 1st when it becomes 25%. I’m building a custom cargo e bike and while I don’t like paying more to the government I understand it will eventually lead to fair trade on both sides, and that is good for America.
Yes it temperately hurts US consumers. Yes manufactures will need to eat or pass on the cost. In the mean time smart businesses will source what they need from countries other than China. Its up to China as to when they agree to a fair trade agreement. Its discomfort for the US, its doing damage to the Chinese economy. As big as the Chinese economy is it is no match for the US economy, especially now that its been unchained by reduced regulations and taxes.
Eventually High Country E-Bike Company may want to take advantage of the Chinese market and expand sales overseas.
For an example on how this strategy works look at the trade opening up in Europe. Tariffs suck, but as a means to an end they can be very effective.

Yvette Grammatical rules are descriptive, not prescriptive. These rules are capricious and they are constantly changing.
Looking to feel good about yourself through public corrections by providing evidence that other people’s language skills suck or yours are superior so that you can feel better about yourself is weak sauce. You might ask yourself why you feel you have something to prove, either to yourself or others. It could also be that you’re threatened, as in you didn’t get the job in a Newsroom.
FYI temperately should be temporarily 😉

Thanks Ms Harvin for being the final straw that I can take in my life. Thank you for denying me because now you have helped to push me over the edge. My suicide and blood is on your hands and I hope you do a better job next time so you don't cause anyone else to lose their lives.

I saw Judge Clayton on Valentine's Day 2019 and the judge really listened to everything I had to say. He looked at every piece of paperwork I had, even ones my doctor hadn't sent to him yet or he had not received before the hearing (2 appts were day before hearing). He was very fair and asks many questions about conditions, work, abilities, activities, etc. He was a great judge and I would say one of the best Greene County has.

Very unfair judge. Did not ask me any questions about my condition, yelled at my lawyer for simply asking me a question, she had her mind made up before I ever went to the hearing. She said she puts no weight in the doctors opinions that have been treating me for over five years. This judge went out of her way to twist the truth and hurt me. I'm 100% disabled and will be homeless because of this nasty woman. This system needs to be overhauled. If you're a white man you don't have a chance of getting disability with this judge.

I had Valencia Jarvis as my S.S. judge and she lied about my medically documented impairments in both physical and also psychological aspects and stated the exact opposite in her findings. To show how truly unfair of a judge this piece of work is, the states own vocational expert stated that I could not do any form of work at all even at sedentary levels and she stated the opposite of this as well in her decision. Unfortunately this is how she is allowed to continue to deny countless others through lies and falsifying documented evidence. Even though I had a rather lengthy rebuttal letter written up on my behalf to the appeals council trying to bring her upon charges for what she did to me showing documented proof that Valencia Jarvis lied to deny, which the appeals council agreed with 100%, they didn't feel this proof warranted my wrongful deny decision to be overturned but rather remanded back to the ALJ stage. Wasted 6 years + of my life and I am still at step one thanks to Valencia Jarvis who I notice does this to an extremely large number of those she oversees case wise. How can people like this stay in power with NO repercussions what so ever??? They need to have star categories going in the negative scale because she deserves a negative ten rating or better yet jail time for her illegal doings via changing court documents to state the opposite. There HAS to be laws against that one would think right? If that were me or you, we'd be in jail IMMEDIATELY so why, even though made aware, does the Social Security Administration get her off their docket or do the right thing and get her disbarred and arrested!!!!!

Judge Cutter is a very fair judge. He listens closely and takes his time to grasp an understanding. He makes others feel comfortable in his court room. He is time efficient. He is very knowledgeable. He is a wonderful person. God bless him.

I was not really sure he believed me because he asked several questions in different ways. Those questions had to do with my limiting my work hours to 20 a week. And then when I went out on medical leave due to the pain I was going through. Maybe he just wanted to make sure I was being consistant. When he asked the occupational expert what he thought, he said that he could find no other jobs to put me into that could accommodate my problems. That made me feel good. But when leaving I just got a bad vibe so I was not sure about it. Was very pleased that he rated me "Fully Favorable". Just be ready to answer a lot of questions .... BE TRUTHFUL!!!

I had Valencia Jarvis as my ALJ. I personally didn’t feel like she was ******. I am white and she never made me feel uncomfortable for being white. There were certain points in the hearing when I noticed she wasn’t looking at me while I tried to explain myself, but then again she could have just been trying to process what I was saying? I have a hard time expressing myself verbally and feel that the hearing could have been a bit longer and maybe I could have been able to express myself better. This whole process has given me major anxiety and I feel so hopeless waiting on a decision that will probably end up in a denial, after reading all of these comments , I really have no hope.

Judge Kyle C Alexander, You gave me a few off the wall jobs that your Specialist said I could do. I'm asking you to help me find one of them, mind you one that I don't have to talk too much, because as I stated in my previous message I sent and as you well know, I lose my voice because of a partially paralyzed vocal chord. You said in your Denial I refused to get surgery to correct it, but what you didn't ask is why I didn't want to get the surgery. If I had the surgery there were risks not worth taking....I need you to show me the job, where I don't have to worry about my Back, knees, or feet hurting and burning from just daily living.... I want you to please remember that I am Human. I didn't ask for all the health issues I have, that when compacted together cause more pain that I Pray you or a Loved one ever has to face. If you can find me one of those jobs I can do with all of the daily obstacles I face, then please let me know what it is.

Judge Bailey, in my opinion is a fair and empathetic judge and person. I really feel that she cares about the people she serve and our situations, and does her best to rule fairly. I felt very comfortable talking to her and I feel that she related to my pain inside, what she couldn’t see, but as a human being, could feel.

She's cold and robotic. You basically have no chance with her. Clearly looking to deny cases. No objective at all. Not fair. Not compassionate. She's going to deny you and use your words out of context. Don't take it personally. She's been told to do it. Don't bother appealing it. Turn around and file again and you will def get a new judge who will be better. She's saving SSA all by herself I'm sure she thinks that anyway.. Sorry if you get her. She should get zero stars

Judge: Whitfield Haigler
7/13/2018 11:58:03 AM
It's been a while since I was approved for Disability but I wanted to report that the honorable Judge: Whitfield Haigler, was easy to be in front of when I went for my hearing. I was terrified of what would happen, but he and all the other people who were there made me feel at ease and I was able to answer their questions and present my case for disability. I am glad I won't have to go through that again. I waited 2 1/2 years to be approved for disability and by not being able to work, I went bankrupt and lost all my assets. I feel that the Social Security Administration should not be so difficult to convince when someone applies for their Social Security. I started working at the age of 16 and worked until the age of 60. After spending years to build up my credit and assets, I lost everything I had due to becoming unable to work, then applying for disability and getting denied three times before being approved. I had to sell everything I owned just to live for those 2 1/2 years with no income at all. Now I am 65 and have a small Social Security income, but I have no assets, and my credit rating is shot to pieces. I will never be prosperous again as long as I live. At this time, I am staying with family, waiting for a low-income apartment to become available for me. I do thank God that this Judge finally approved my disability because if he hadn't, I don't know what would have happened to me.

Thank you Judge for approving my case after it was denied twice and gave me the chance to tell my story to you and how this injury have affected me and my wife life. I am vey grateful to you for helping me receive my benefits. This shows me that the SSA system is fair if you have your medical records and a SSA attorney with you when you go to a hearing. Great Judge to have to tell your truth to him. And you do not have to be nervous at the hearing.

Judge Harvin-Woode was very thorough and took time to listen to the details of my condition. After more than 4 years of waiting for a hearing she wasted not time as her decision took less than 30 days. I am not happy to be disabled, but very happy that she could navigate through my complicated medical records and make a decision. Thank you Judge Woode for your time and consideration regarding my case.

He is as unethical as decedent Judge Leonard E. Yoswein and decedent Judge Sol A. Wieselthier. I hope both are forever in the Lake of Fire and Brimstone to the glory of Yehowah Eloah, i.e. English 'Lord God''. I pray that Yehowah Eloah executes supernaturally avenging justice upon you, Charles Woode, for your injustice to defame my sound mentality and deny my authentic (physical) disablity. You're a fraudster and won't escape the avenging indignation of His Majesty, Yehowah Eloah. Enjoy your ill-gotten livelihood and the time left on this side of the grave. You won't escpate your eternal fate, Mr. Woode.

This man, call judge, is nothing more than a biased snobbish ****, in a black cape. I was denied my case because he believed that lupus was caused by my weight. He then cited that he was also going off the recommendation of the psychologist, that I saw. Funny thing THAT psychologist actually supported my claim - he and I had a very volatile visit but he supported the claim none-the-less! Absolute proof that he legislates from a tiny chair and believes he does not need to be bothered with the file, and reading all those notes and stats. He has eyes, and he is 'godly'. He has the psychic like intuition. He doesn't need any third party or medical recommendations. He can look at you and just know what you're worth, what you deserve, and who you are. Forget appalled, I am simply grossed out by the putridity of your organization. My absolute Solace is that I have a GOD. And we all will stand before HIM. May HE judge each of you completely and may you suffer the consequences of your actions eternally. Your game that you've been playing with the sick, the diseased and the broken makes you and those who follow that evil logic nothing more than legal mass murderers and torturers. GTH, Brandee

He was very biased, he had no compassion and before I could sit down he was already saying my case was unfavorable.

Ahhh judge Doyle. Careful if you get this one especially if you are younger as he is the man when it comes to age discrimination. Unfortunately my conditions don’t care how old you are but he does. 700+ pages of medical evidence and a letter from a physician and he comes back and says not enough medical treatment.

Judge: C. H Prinsloo
1/11/2018 5:45:11 PM
I had my hearing with Judge Prinsloo on 9/28/17 in Seattle, WA he is no longer in St. Louis. Here it is 1/11/18 and still no decision. I am very upset by this. I called Seattle ODAR the other day and they said it has been in unassigned writing since 10/6/17. Since approvals take priority and denials are harder to write my guess is that it is a denial as it has been sitting waiting to be written for 3 months. I am very distraught and i find this practice of approvals being written up first to be completely disrespectful to those denied. They should be written in order recieved the approvals should NOT take priority as their fight is over and the denials need to figure out their next move... Appeals Council? New Application? Look for a job they probably won't get and IF they did wouldn't be able to keep? Or give up and kill themselves cause at least their kids would be able to collect survivor's benefits? FYI i am NOT suicidal i am just listing it as an option. So, you may ask why did she give this judge 5 stars? I won't judge someone based on their approval or denial of me... I haven't recieved a letter so technically i am not denied YET. Plus the other stuff of me waiting forever and approvals taking priority is all bureaucracy and not necessarily in his control. Whether i get a denial or by the grace of God an approval I am rating him with 5 stars for his court mannerisms... He was respectful and listened. So thank you Judge Prinsloo for your time both in court and out working on my case. It can't be easy having a job deciding someone's fate.

Judge Alexander saw me & immediately made the comment that he read what the Doctors said, but I was too young to be having all the problems I was. He then sent me to his Dr. who even said that I would not be able to lift over 20lbs, stand too much, squat, bend, put my arms above my head, climb stairs, and yet I was still denied. He had the date of my Disability incur switched to when I filed, even though I only was working because SS said I needed to work another year in order to even file, because I was short credits. I have General Anxiety Disorder, Hypothyroidism, Hypoglycemia, Hypertension, MVP, a partially paralyzed vocal chord, Tendonitis in both Wrist & Elbows, Tarsal tunnel in both Ankles, Arthritis in both knees, Scoliosis with Herrington rods, Degenerative disc Disease in my lower n upper Back & Cervical Lordosis, Bulging disc in my lower spine. I can not talk for more than 20 minutes or I will lose my voice. I can't walk for more than 30 minutes without hurting, I have to sit in a lounge position and even then my bottom falls asleep & hurts. I take medicine for my Pain, stay fatigued, trouble with my Memory & Hair loss, constipation, weight gain, mood swings. According to the Judge & the Vocational Rehabilitation rep. that called into my 2nd Appeal I can work certain jobs, mind you I have a High School education and my job experience is in Child care & retail, 2 jobs I can't do again. All I can say for certain is that I am a Christian and I know that God has me facing All of this for a reason. The Judge had a Chance to be fair, but he wasn't, but I am not going to hold it against him. I forgive him, after all he will have to stand before the Lord one day & will have to answer for the Judging he does.

Judge Ehrman has not ruled on my case yet. However. Honestly regardless of his decision. I owe him to say thank you for making it an easy experience at the hearing. I was extremely nervous. Scared even. However as soon as he greeted me with respect and started to explain the process in a pleasant way I was much calmer. Judge Ehrman stayed very calm. Patient respectful and very kind through out the hearing. Thank you very much.

Judge: Valencia Jarvis
8/21/2017 1:47:19 PM
This is sad. I had also this judge, She disproves me for all kinds of craziness. At the time my lawyers were no help. because the day of my hearing I had a bad ear problem. And because I said about my mother. I have 5 daughters and at the time all of us was taken care of her. But what does have to do with the tea China? I had got a settlement and she made me feel like trash because she said they just paid you off. That hurt me so bad. I am one that does not play with the government. I work for what I wanted. Now because she sent me back out in the work force. I lost my job because I can not walk. SSI is a joke. These guys will not even send me to their doctors. The main doctor that want to see me. I can not go to him because I have to pay 420 to see him. You all might be judges but there is a judge much higher than you all. And you will give an account of what you have done to people. At first, I hated this judge because she uses my mother to for my claim. Everyone is fast to through the old folks in the Nursing home. What was wrong with me giving my mother water or feeding her. My other daughter would help clean her. SSI has a way of using trick words to see if you are lying. But they are quick to put a child on SSI who mother knew the guy she was with had a mental problem.But yet she still had a child by him and then go to SS. To get a check .But a person like me who can not walk nor stand nor sit for a long time. They quick to say you can work. Like I said I hated this judge .But God changes it and gave me a love for her. I do feel sorry for her and all the other judges that feel that they are God. I am in pain 24/7. Orlando judges have a better rating than any of these judges here do. She heard my case in 2015 in Brevard County. My prayers are that this judge and every other judge would put themselves in the person body and feel what they feel. I told this judge about my back crying and now because of her judgment, I can not walk that good at all.

I went before Judge Whitfield Haigler and must say that he is a very polite and respectful Judge. He explains the process, before the Hearing begins and asks if there is anything that you do not understand. He is a fair Judge and tries to make the process more comfortable. I won't know thd decision for a few months; however, I felt that Judge Haigler is a great Judge and I was treated with complete respect. I felt like he saw me as a human and nothe just some case number. The waiting begins.

Korin Mueller has one of the lowest case approval ratings. If you are unfortunate enough to have her appointed as your Judge, consider your hearing as only a formality. How there can be a 40% difference between Judges approval of cases is beyond me. The judge you are assigned is most important part of deciding your approval for SSD. How you dress, behave, or answer questions is secondary. The most important factor is the Judge that you are assigned. Just hope that the Judge lottery does not appoint Korin Mueller as your judge.

Finally I got a overturned decision by this horrible judge. I suffer from PTSD and have a lower left foot amputation. She deemed that I could work long I did not stand or sit for linger than hour of and on through a 8 hour shift. Moreover; se stated that my Veteran Affairs doctors was lying about the severity of my conditions. She stated that because the veterans affairs doctors was a separate division and those doctors cared no weight when it come to a Residential Function Capacity nor could the evaluate my daily living. I am a 100% Permanent and Total Disabled War Veteran. Here's the kicker Voc. Rehab guy went along with her. Following the hearing he congratulated me of my service and stated that he was in the Bay Of Pigs campaign. I was so angry I became tearful. Judge Tammy Georgian, question all of my military health record's even though 5 different Dr.'s state disability's. She diagnosed me herself as norsicistic and now I am even more suicidal. She need to be disbarred

Judge: Valencia Jarvis

Valencia Jarvis entirely ignored social security's own physicians as well as my medical history. In her decision she wrote, "I think this person can work". I have an amputated right leg and other ongoing health issues. What more do you need to be disabled in her judgement? Consistent with her track record, she ignored the facts and ignored the law. I do not know how the federal government is still employing this ***** woman in a position of responsibility.

I am writing this to all who give judges 5 stars before they hear results and also to the nature of the disability system in MO which is legitimately corrupt. I believe judges should be fair and reasonable and LISTEN to the medical reasons for a disability as well as examine Dr. records. Some judges will do this and still reject your claim. Others will be rude and talk over your comments and ignore everything you say just to deny you. This is wrong and these judges need to be removed from the bench. The press should have revealed this long ago. From my understanding, the system uses the monies for disability claims to also pay the judges and then give them a bonus if they deny claims more than approve if there is money left over. This is highly questionable and unfair. I believe the entire system needs to be setup again properly with good judges and a fair payment to them for service not from the funds of the afflicted. I hope Governor-Elect Eric Greitens can clean up and drain prejudicial and unfair swamp soon! St. Louis and MO is in dire need of a major change in our judicial system to make it fair and equitable for real hurting disabled individuals and not give out awards for skin color or any other reason.

James Griffith -- Arrogant, Condescending, Unprofessional. Incompetent and Disrespectful Federal Employee. Bully. I had surgery on my gonads as a result of a motorcycle accident and James Griffith really seemed to dwell on that, asking way too many questions about my penis. It made me very uncomfortable. It was totally unrelated to my disability claim, so I do not understand why he would engage in this line of questioning. He seems to hate military veterans. Maybe it's because deep down inside, he knows that he was too much of a wimp to join up himself.

Hi, I would like to say that I consider Judge Alexander to be a fair Judge. He asked detailed questions and actually listened to what I had to say. I thank him for approving my case. My only problem is that now that I'm approved, why is it taking so long to get the process started. I have been waiting over 2 1/2 years. My lawyer, Deborah Grossman, has expedited my case and we still have no results. I have lost everything I have waiting. I am single and have no one to help me. My mom has been doing her best but she only gets 969.00 a month in SS. She can no longer help. I can't afford to go see my doctor or the specialists. I can't afford to get my medication. I am in so much pain. I need to see my ENT because I'm afraid the cancer is back in my mouth , I have been suspecting it for about 6 months.

I Judge Ben Barnett to be a very patient and understanding Judge. He will ask for both an opening and closing statement. As well as ask 75% of the questions. Judge Barnett will give the representative a chance to ask claimant questions before questioning the VE. I found Judge Ben Barnett to be quite fair, as he followed all of the SSA guidelines.

I've suffered from anxiety, panic disorder, depression and OCD for 22 years. Even with all of the medical evidence from my psychiatrist and 6 different psychologists/therapists I felt that I would lose my SSD case because I have the "invisible illness". I didn't expect to win but I was pleasantly surprised that Judge Cutter ruled in my favor. My case was very complex and I even had to fire my lawyer, but Judge Cutter looked solely at the medical evidence and made the correct decision. I'd like to thank him for helping me to get the help that I've needed for a very long time. Without his ruling I would have been in a terrible financial and mental state. At least I can fully concentrate on getting my mental health to where it should be for the sake of my wife and family. My life will never be as it was prior to 1993, but thanks to Judge Cutter I can focus on the future. Again, I thank him for ruling in my favor. He was very fair, helpful and professional. I'll do my very best to put my life back together. Best wishes to Judge Cutter.

Judge chrisensen was such a nice, caring man. He truly cared about what I was going through. He was kind and patient. The VE (I can't remeber her name) was also very sweet. I am so thankful I was assigned these two people.

I want to understand how my case was denied when the occupational therapist himself said there was "ZERO" JOBS FOR ME AVAILABLE,with my limitations then how did I get denied my 5th time..I've proven my case over n over,,this is just not fair,,I think judge Mills. Should find me this so called work I can do with my limitations that WILL pay more then 733.00$ a month...find one for me please

THIS JUDGE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED! I'm 57 years old, worked for 37 years in retail sales. I have lymphoma cancer, severe arthritis, bad back, hip replacement, CKD (result of pain medication) . I cannot stand for hours as necessary in my job because of back/joint arthritis and constant pain. Driving to work is challenging, I have a 40 minute commute. Yet this judge was more concerned in my appearance and how I traveled to the hearing (my daughter drove me, I dressed professional as I always have) Questions suggested I could "find a way to sit" or "transferring" to a backroom job. I was denied. My attorney was flabbergasted as I am. Now I see why. The highest denial rate for a relatively new judge earning pay in the upper 10% of SSA. This is a sham! Her high pay must be tied to her high denial rate. A disgrace to disabled workers and to judges!!!

I was very surprised with the judge, after reading these comments I'll admit I was worried about nothing. I found Judge Alexander to be very nice and seemed to really listen to what I had to say. He was pressed for time, but allowed my attorney to present the particulars about my case. After testifying and answering the questions he had, I was approved. Part of my case was not even presented due to missing doctor notes! I can only say to be prepared to testify. It's not just about a diagnosis but how the diagnosis affects you and your ability to work. A vocational expert will be there to testify about any work you may be able to do despite your disability. Make sure you have proper documentation also. You need to be under a doctors care, and not just go in with an opinion from a doctor.

I had my hearing with the "judge" back in 2013. Of course, it did not go in my favor. Yes, look at her ratings. Even when she was a judge in Missouri, her ratings were almost exact as they are here in Fort Lauderdale. I was very shocked when I received the first denial letter, after the hearing. She MOST CERTAINLY makes her own rules. So many different times where she had manipulated what I had testified, to suit her decision. She is very dishonest when she writes out her decision letter. I think the only thing that was true on the letter was my name and age. The rest....fabricated. What's crazy is, this is OUR money that we paid into over our working years, obviously, otherwise we wouldn't have a sum that we should be collecting. I also agree with the ones who say she is prejudice. I believe it!! As soon as she seen me walk in, she had made her decision, before I even spoke one word. It seemed odd to me also that she kept asking me questions, concerning my partner. Did she have me on her insurance, was she the one that took care of me, did she buy my clothes, did she pay for my medicine?, etc. None of that was mentioned in the letter. I do feel for the ones who have upcoming hearings with this woman. She is not a fair judge....period. Why no one at the SS administration has stopped and asked the question of why her stats are ALWAYS the same every year, is beyond me. My total outcome after all of this??? Right back to where I was 4 years ago......

Why is this judge here? She heard my case December 16, 2015 and denied it also. I have nothing mean to say about her, but I know my body and what I can and cannot do and at this point I am 57 years of age. I was working towards my retirement and had a tumor found on my spinal cord. The removal of the tumor cause me more problems than before it was removed, but for her to make a decision on me being able to hold down a job when I take pain meds four times a day. I found it hard to stand at my sink to wash dishes, or cook. I can't stand cold weather or the air conditioner. She asked how I could be at my hearing and that how I looked. Well what did she want me to do come as I looked when I got out of bed? Really, but looking at these status and this just is just amazing. How do they sleep at night? Do they serve a God and how do they do it. I will not give up and just keep on doing what is required of me by the state of SC. I will be 62 in 5 more years. Will they deny me for the next five year I have heard so people say they have tried for a total of 9 years to get disability? What kind of system is this?

Mr. wilson i honestly didnt mean any disrespect just put urself in my shoes fighting for four years an getting denied mostly because i dont have any medical insurance or any money an i cant go to the specialist an other doctors that i need to go to especially about my heart an the neck surgery needed to get an like me you couldnt get anyone to understand thats why i dont have these specific details that are needed an the thought of not seeing my kids an possibly by the time i get approved two of them is gonna be grown up an ive missed out on time ill never get back with them if i could work i would i hate all this everything that makes my life worth living i have lost because i am unable to work an the denials i got before this last one i had a place to live an was hanging on but i couldnt afford to get denied when i went in front of you in court i new that pretty much my life was in ur hands i know that sounds dramatic but its true an i have witnesses that will testify to my situation i even asked my lawyer if i could let you know all of that at the end of the hearing an she said it wasnt a good idea i just knowed if i would have ben you athen i would have wanted to know if my decision could possibly put a persons life in danger meaning me not having food of a way to go to the doctor an get my medication well i just thought i should double check an make sure you new i wasnt trying to be rude at all an i truly believe if another person was in my situation they would say what i have said an everything i have said is true if proof is eded i can prove utit an i hope you read these comments thank you for youre time.

This so called judge is not fit to determine anything. He is clearly working to deny as many cases as possible as evidenced by his 70% denial rate. He seemed to already have the case decided before I even said a word. He is not fair, very hard to understand, and should not be any kind of judge. All we ask for was a fair hearing and we got this guy. If you get him, try to request another Judge.

I want to thank judge Leise for believing in me and awarding me with a Check to help me get my life started back up after a 6 year battle of a brain tumor. After two surgeries and a lot of Bikram Hot yoga, I am completely healthy. I'm now a full time teacher of Bikram Hot yoga in Katy TX. I have a new life now. With the money I got, I moved to TX from Oregon, got my car fixed, an apartment and so on. I'm now helping people get healthy, I love my job, and I love this new life I have. I'm so grateful. I could not have moved and got this full time teaching job if I had not received this money. I just want judge Leise to know that I spent every penny on starting my life over and now I'm back to a productive person in our community, and I give back every day. Thank you and God bless you.

This ALJ has got to be one of the most biased I have ever seen. I have been fighting this battle for over 9 years. I just won a reverse and a remand from District Court and Grit still denied me. How is it that the federal government can dismiss my student loan due to disabilities yet on the State level they don't acknowledge your disabilities? How is it that my treating doctor for several years, the same one who filled out my government disability form, who just happens to be an investigative doctor for the good State of Michigan is not given weight?

My son Eric Bailey will be standing before you on Dec. 3rd. I pray that his testimony will be strong enough to help see what his ailments are, inside and out. I am Eric's mother Beverly Bailey and I would be their if my health permitted. I guess I know him inside and out and I hope the judge will read this and know this comes from the bottom of my heart. Eric has been with me for over a year helping in any way his body permits. Eric's mind is troubled as well as his body. He recently had a nervous break down, which left him even more disturbed.Eric's mind is the size of a 10 year old. He can't handle discord, and more then ever could not complete a task. Eric's disability is mostly inside, although I know his body is broken down.. Eric has a10 yr. old and a 15 yr.old living in his home I do what I can and pray daily that he will be awarded his disability. He says he does not care about back pay, just a little to pay bills and help with food for him and his children. I write this from my heart, and pray you will see what is inside of my son.

From Attorney--My comment reflects the above comment by claimant with PTSD-I just reviewed one of my cases that will be heard in the next six months and my written comment to my staff was to obtain all evidence available as Judge Schueler is a caring and considerate gentleman, who, presented with proper evidence is dedicated to doing the right thing for people. His judicial manner is great and he has a heart while dutifully adhering to the law, as required. It's a comfort to be able to look forward to appearing before Judge Schueler again and trusting that a well-based decision will be made.

This woman has to be on the craziest power trip ever. She makes things up, twists reality, and apparently knows more than the doctors do. IF you get her, pray for a miracle. I know there's a lot of fraud going on, but she denies people who are legitimately disabled in order to combat the high SSA rates. I'm suspicious of a racism element as well, but I won't confirm it because it's not like she flat out called me a honky.If you do get her, DO NOT GIVE HER AN INCH. She'll take your inch and turn it into a mile. I told her the medicine will sometimes work, about 10% of the time. She turned that into "the medicine works almost all of the time". Variety of different things were manipulated to suit her decision. She had already denied me the minute I spoke, the rest of the trial was just a formality and a way to twist the truth into her fraudulent, deceptive decision.

I was recently denied with all the health problems I have such as congestive heart failure what's a pacemaker /defibrillator, kidney failure, diabetes which I have to take three shots per day, asthma, shoulder replacement which I can't lift 10 pounds ever, arthritis, gout, plum sized hernia in my testicles, walnut sized hernia in my stomach, lungs constantly filled with fluid I mean making it difficult for me to breathe. I had to go back to work doing a different occupation because I was denied Social Security 5 times before that so I had to work to pay my bills and was hospitalized three times in 10 months of working at the new job, also I'm on 13 different medications which makes me dizzy and sleepy, by my working I had to skip dosage which made my conditions worse, the judge did not take that into consideration she pretty much denied me for going back to work. Very unfair judge I guess she get big bonuses for denying people.

So disappointed in the judge. Stated comments that my psychiatrist did not say. Tried to intimidate me into saying it was correct. I know some people try to abuse the system. I'm not one of those. She discounted all of my documented evidence from all of my doctors. It was a joke. She used the fact that I try to walk without a cane against me. I only use it when necessary. I don't try to over act or pretend. I was so disgusted with her that I started not to file again. I got an attorney who told me to keep filing until you turn 65. He told me that I worked hard over 20 years and did not cause my injury. I had a super work history and loved what I did. I still will not lie under oath. I will tell the truth and I will answer questions correctly. If you have been denied by this judge, please do not give up. I will continue to fight for my case and I encourage you to do the same.

Judge James B. Griffith was polite, kind and very brief at my hearing. All he said was that my evidence was in order and that he is approving my disability. Then, he signed the paperwork. The whole process took less than 5 minutes. I guess it pays to have good attorneys and everything to prove you deserve disability.

When you a disease that's destroying your muscle,that is slow moving and people don't take the time to research and learn about a dfiseade that there is no cure for nor a treatment to make it better. I just don't understand this. I feel the dedesion is wrong.I have worked all my life and just couldn't do it anymore because of all the pains I have on a daily bases.

3 out of 4 nos on the hypotheticals, 2+ years of medical documentation from 3 doctors practically identical to the Blue Book and you still denied my appeal. Today, Judge Terry, you devastated my family. You have affected our lives in ways that we may never recover, and most of them are not financial. More time should've been spent reading the reports instead of trying to read the person. Your statistics seem to show that you believe most people are liars.

3/4/2015 5:56:46 AM
Another one here where she totally lied on my decision. She stated I was a social butterfly, yeah, those words killed me, and said I had numerous friends to visit, etc.. Well truth is, I've been socially isolating for the past 3 years and have had a total of 1 friend visit. Something I testified too. She also said I could grocery shop by myself, etc, which I haven't done in quite some time and also testified too. I told her that in the beginning I wasn't compliant with my diabetes because I was in denial, well she wrote that I wasn't compliant NOW, which is NOT what I said in my hearing, I told her that I have been VERY compliant now because I was in the beginning of kidney issues. Oh and per her decision I have no cognitive issues, yet I also testified that I couldn't remember any of my medical classes anymore, had to have reminders to take my blood sugar and my medications and hubby took over all bills because I kept forgetting to pay them. She also used the "grid" to determine that I wasn't disabled, which she WASN'T supposed to use for her overall determination, yet that was her greatest weight for denial, and she used a grid for someone below age 50, I am now 53! So her "grid" thinking is totally skewed. I have no idea why this woman is in any position to control peoples lives!! Oh and she totally discounted what both my doctors wrote, that there is NO WAY I can hold a job for 8 hours a day, or even 4 hours a day, she just dismissed what the people who see me 3-6 times a year said and took only the SSA doctors, who I've never seen into account. She's a farce, and shouldn't be allowed to make decisions that affect others lives. I hope she's fired before my appeal comes through.
Judge: Valencia Jarvis
2/12/2015 4:40:24 PM
I had the same experience as the last person who wrote in about Valencia Jarvis. She made up facts to support her decision to deny me benefits, and ignored she facts that were in evidence contradicting her ruling. I can't say she's mean spirited. She might simply be incompetent. Regardless, it's clear that a judge (Valencia Jarvis) who is consistently at the lowest end of granting approvals is using criteria that is inconsistent with standards set by social security. It's beyond me how Valencia Jarvis still has been able to hold onto her job. Perhaps social security hold performance reviews? i don't know. It's sad and shameful that Valencia Jarvis is still allowed to be in a position of responsibility for which she is clearly ill-suited and its allowed to cause pain to people who deserve better. I deserve better. We all deserve better.

I am still waiting for my decision, it has been almost 60 days however judge Leise was very kind and very patient with me as i was nervous and trying to answer the questions as well as i could. i appreciate her time and even if i am denied i will hold no harsh feelings. i will still appeal any denial however i do not hold harsh feelings because it would be hard as a judge to determine whether or not a person who is maybe borderline disabled meaning i cant work however my work history shows a period of 10 years of work. which ended in termination because of the lack of coming to work due to the depression.
Judge: Valencia Jarvis
8/7/2014 12:05:27 PM
I had Valencia Jarvis as my S.S. judge and she lied about my medically documented impairments in both physical and also psychological aspects and stated the exact opposite in her findings. To show how truly unfair of a judge this piece of work is, the states own vocational expert stated that I could not do any form of work at all even at sedentary levels and she stated the opposite of this as well in her decision. Unfortunately this is how she is allowed to continue to deny countless others through lies and falsifying documented evidence. Even though I had a rather lengthy rebuttal letter written up on my behalf to the appeals council trying to bring her upon charges for what she did to me showing documented proof that Valencia Jarvis lied to deny, which the appeals council agreed with 100%, they didn't feel this proof warranted my wrongful deny decision to be overturned but rather remanded back to the ALJ stage. Wasted 6 years + of my life and I am still at step one thanks to Valencia Jarvis who I notice does this to an extremely large number of those she oversees case wise. How can people like this stay in power with NO repercussions what so ever??? They need to have star categories going in the negative scale because she deserves a negative ten rating!

I recently appeared in front of Judge Davenport. My wife suffers from severe social phobia and mental psychosis. The Judge was very kind to allow me to sit in the room with my wife. I feed the judge listend fairly to my wifes testimony. Responded well with the lawyer and VE. He asked well target hypothetical questions to the VE regarding my wifes conditon. Regardless of the outcome; I feel Judge Davenport provides a fair and non judgmental court room where the actual evidince is used and the judge does not predetermin cases.
Judge: L. R BaileySmith
6/19/2014 11:26:47 PM
I do not believe that Judge BaileySmith makes fair decisions regarding social security disability. In my decision she stated that she gave NO weight to the governments doctor that evaluated me and stated I should not work around people. She stated she gave NO or no weight to my treating doctor who said I did not need to work. She did give weight to a doctor that I saw for 8 weeks & that I told constantly I was still in pain, but he told me to wait a month and see if I was still hurting... She stated I could sit for 30 min/then stand for 30 min all day and work like that. But my medical records state I am in pain if I sit or stand. They also state my medication makes me drowsy, as I've fallen asleep twise on the interstate already trying to do the right thing & work and not ask for help. But since Judge Bailysmith wants me to work if I hurt myself, or someone else because she chose not to believe factual statements from medical professionals and the patient then it will be her that has to live with that decision because I have not driven more than 5 miles I since it got so scared from falling asleep at the wheel after being kept up all night in severe pain. I didn't want to stop working, I had to quit working. I do understand that there are people that don't deserve it, but this is something I actually needed. I've never ask anyone for help before, and I've worked since I was 15 years old. I didn't ask for this pain. It's hard to understand unless you live in my shoes.

To the person that wrote the most recent post on 5/13/2014. Sounds exactly like my outcome. She completely ignored the medical data. Only gave "great weight" to the report from the Disability doctor that reviewed my records,never saw me in person and was an prior felon with 90+ felony drug charges against him and is currently under a probationary license in FL. I too wondered if I don't look sick enough or if it is because I am a white middle-aged man that has put in 30 years in the work force and payed taxes, maybe she saves her 16% approvals for her Black friends. She is immoral and disgusting. If you choose to appeal, make sure to put those facts in the appeal and also state that you refuse to be heard by her again. That is what my attorney has done, still waiting the appeal. If they insist that you go before her again, find a friend in Dade County and put in a change of address, then your case can be moved to another judge in the Miami system instead of having to go before her a second time in Broward. Good Luck!

It was a long and lonely process, but you have given me hope. Thank you Judge Sue Leise. I can't stop crying. I hope the suicidal thoughts will go away as a result of your favorable decision. My parents don't need to be burdened with me any more. I will be able to continue treatment and stay on medication. I have a new "Leise" on life! I would not wish my problems on anyone.

This woman, Jarvis, takes all the information provided in the hearing and twists EVERYTHING to suit her decision. She leaves out information, as well as evidence and states that the "claimant" says this or that, when it is UNTRUE!!! Isn't she suppose to uphold to a certain oath of truth as well??? Many things in my "decision" letter were just fabricated lies...plain and simple. Even though there are so many doctor reports and questionnaires filled out by credible doctors, she says that she gives "no weight or little weight" to what they say. That is, unless your a doctor for Social Security, then by all means...she will state that she gives THEM all the weight in the world! She loves to play God and decide someones fate, who really needs to have the decision go in their favor. Shame on her for thinking she could just wily nilly say, "I don't like this person, I find your decision UNFAVORABLE". Maybe I was dressed too nice (out of respect for a hearing), maybe I didn't look sick, maybe I was well spoken?? Maybe because I'm ***, go ahead and deny me my benefits?? I am just so amazed, that looking at her "Approval rating", this woman is still allowed to "Judge" people and decide their fate. I have ZERO respect for her or anyone like this person, who decides what is accepted and what is not.

Wish I could appear before him with more cases. Reasonable, calm, professional, rational and logical--whatever his decision, I believe he will make it fairly and will consistently apply the law. Know your case, though, and be prepared to adapt your presentation if he points out an issue about which he wants more information. In my most recent case, he asked me to address a past work issue at the beginning of my questioning.

This creep ruined my life. He was rude, and highly nasty and screamed at myself and my lawyer at the time. He ignored evidence, and his behavior started a chain of events in which the next "judge" ignored evidence as well, despite me having more evidence than the first time in court. Because of his behaviors, and the behaviors of the SSA, and them deliberately dragging their feet on my case for 7 yrs, they caused me to no longer be eligible for SSD, only SSI, in which the so called gvt can ****** money from SSI as they see fit. There is a time limit on whether you can be eligible for SSD and this fool and all of his buddies were in cahoots together to try and ruin me. I also filed a complaint to the White House, the mayors office in Jefferson City as well as the commissioner's office and all of that was to no avail. SSA thinks they are God, and they will back up the judge no matter how much evidence he ignored, no matter how racist they are, they will back that person up. Now are you ready for this? I found out that he is no longer listed with the SSA judges. How interesting is that. Can you sniff sniff, smell a cover up? I can. I guess his buddies told him that there were too many complaints and that he needed to retire. I hope to God with the REAL God, that he gets everything that he deserves in life. How dare you p** on ppl who have lost their health, lost their careers and now they lost their chance for a real hearing with a real judge with real emotions.

Judge Terry is a biased an unfair Hearing Officer for this ODAR Court. In His unfavorable decision in my case, he ignored and/or neglected pertinent information purveyed in my testimony. Repeatedly, he contradicts himself throughout his written decision. He makes insinuations and pre-judgments instead of sternly weighing ALL of the evidence before him. He is a disgrace to the Law regarding SSA Rules and Regulations. And yes, his biased and unfavorable decision, despite the fact of overwhelming objective medical evidence as to my disability, is presently under review by the Appeals Council. Moreover, should the Council prove to be as biased as Judge terry, I will file my appeal in Federal Court. Judge Terry should shudder at the very thought of a Federal Judge being summoned to review my case.

Judge: Jeffrey J Schueler
4/18/2014 4:11:04 AM
I have went in front of ALJ Schueler twice. My first was time in november and the second time was 2 days ago. He seems like a good person and treats claims with respect. I suffer from PTSD and a few other thing, but the PTSD bothers me the most. I was avictim to a ruthless violent crime where I was nearly beat to death in public by 5 people in broad daylight but the people that witnessed the crime did not bother to at least call the cops. I would have died if the guy that recognized me and helped me would have been 1 minute later literally. This has left me aprisoner of my own home for the past 8 years almost. I have no way to support myself so I have to rely on family. I shouldnt have to be their life long burden. The judge sent me to be evaluated by one of their consultants. The consultant did agree that I have severe limitations around the public. I have severe anxiety around anyone I dont know. I just hope he comes to a just decision and i can help my family take care of me. He seems to actually cares about the claims and over all is a genuine nice person. I have done research when I can about other cases in different states from people that suffer from PTSD. I have read about a man that was approved because the store he worked at was robbed and the the man was held up at gun point. I know that had to be traumatic but I am lucky just to be alive. I hope all of you that are truly disabled get a ALJ like Schueler. He doesnt degrade people, and shows respect to us that are. I know he cannot approve every case but if all your asking for is a fair chance and for some one to really look at your case he will.

I am a Minnesota attorney with 25+ years of experience. First, a comment about the "low approval rate" at NHC in St. Louis. Their office is trying to help hearing offices around the country catch up on the huge backlog of claims. You can decline a video hearing and wait many more months for a hearing in person with a Minneapolis judge. Many attorneys tell me they always decline the video hearings because of these same statistics. What they don't understand is their actions may be the exact reason the statistics look so bad. The judges are much more likely to dismiss or deny a claim that does not have all the important evidence in or unprepared witnesses. An experienced attorney matters. My clients and I have appeared in front of Judge Haigler multiple times. You can tell he has always read the file carefully. (Not true of all judges.) Like appearing in front of the Supreme Court for oral arguments, he will tell the attorney at the beginning of the hearing the specific parts of the record he needs clarified or explained if we want to convince him of the severity of the medical problems. He is respectful and courteous questioning the claimant. He allows you to go past the usual one hour hearing time if you have a translator or essential witness.

I found Judge Barnett to be a very good listener he asked for opening and closing comments and let my lawyer ask all the questions, when she was done he had 3 questions for me and 1 question to the vocational expert and even though he has a 31% approval rating i found him to be quite fair, not because he found me disabled but because he followed the guidelines of the ssa.At this time i would like to thank my attorney from Freedom Disability Michelle Huerta for a job well done.

Judge Patrick Cutter is a wonderful judge. He is truly one of the best LAJ. in the county. He was very fair in the way he handled my case he took it step by step explaining the procedure before we ever got started. He took control of the entire hearing asking all questions that were important and concerning my case. If he didn't get the proper answer he wanted to hear, he rephrased it much easier for me to understand. He also allowed me time to explain my total conditions without interruptions. He also understood my entire situation and conditions and handle them in a very Professional matter. The hearing was lengthy but it needed to be in order to produce a fair verdict. He asks a lot about your conditions in order to be fair. Despite what other people may think of Judge Cutter. He handle the case the in the most Professiional way a judge could handle a case. I personally want to thank judge cutter, for hearing my case and giving me the proper and most fair hearing a client could receive. I Took the time to evaluate Judge Cutter because he deserves the credit for all the hard work he puts into each and every case he hears. If you are truthful with the Judge he is true to you.

This is one of the Doctors (If you can call him that) that Florida uses to determine the Health and Well being of it's Disability claimants. Judge Jarvis said she gave his report the "most weight" yet he had not reviewed the majority of my medical records since the tests and Specialists reports came after his review of my records. He has surrendered his medical license in two others states due to this same type of activity. Currently under Probationary License in Florida. Had 90 charges against him in Florida. Has been admitted twice (that I can find) to drug rehab for abusing Hydrocodone, Yet he is still used in Florida and paid by our Government to review Disability cases. Lets Put A Stop to this!

This judge denied my mother and denied her for the wrong diagnosis. She stated my mother has well controlled diabetes and Hep C, neither of these are true. After waiting two months and using every resource that I had to continue to take care of my mother to be told this is SICK. I take care of her, I see how ill she is, how many times she falls and blacks out from sugars, how she goes with out insurance and I pay for her medications. How we have been evicted and are behind and sinking even more daily and have no chance of any help. It just SICK. She said my mom didn't keep her appointments. Well your honor, there is one car, my mother has problems driving due to her sugars changing consitently and feels unsafe. I work full time in the medical Field If I lose my job how can I keep us going even if its not that well. It is Christmas and we have nothing losing our place to live my car is behind my mother is short on her medications and you Deny her!. I plan to make sure that this goes as far as I need to take it. This is poor judgement on your part as a judge. Stating that you were not in agreance with the Doctor that stated clearly she is disabled, I would like to say They are a physician you, your honor are a judge! I work in the medical field I see poeople get this for as things as simple as sinus issues, My mother is Ill, the least you could have done is got her correct diagnosis but that could be be cause you are a judge and not a doctor. Following the doctor's would have been helpful!

8/29/2013 1:25:33 PM
This ALJ did grant my client's case and of course I was very gracious. And to his credit he may have a generous heart, but it does not show in how he conducts himself on the bench. He rudely kept sending the court reporter to try to force us to begin early and my client had questions before we went into hearing. Once we entered, he was quite rude and unprofessional. For example, he asked about the amended onset date and when I told him. He shouted and asked if I forced claimant into amending her onset date or threatened to kill her. He told me I was being combative ---- there was a better way he could have handled this. When I told him to repeat what he needed from us, he turned really ugly..... To get irritated and upset because someone has a question is being a huge jerk. More like a power tripper as someone on this blog stated. I normally amend onset dates on the record and never had an issue but he likes a specific line of questioning from attorney to claimant where claimant swears you did not threaten their life to change their disability date. I completely understand why he does it, but just explain it because every judge handles this differently, don't be a huge d*ck about it.

6/17/2013 12:53:39 AM
I think this judge is very unfair and doesnt take in to count that you can have bad and good days. The fact that you can fuction for a hour or two a day to take care of a child or that you can go to the grocery store to get food, (even though you have to be there about 6 hours and sit down over a half dozen times, and take a pill just so you dont freak out) means that you can work and maintain a normal life. My daughter only shops where she knows that she can hide in the coolers in the stores if she has a panic attack, the same store that friends work at that can help her if she starts to have pain, or that can get to me or at least get her to her truck so she can try to get home. She dont socialize or interact with anyone other than close friends or family as to not scare people, and with all the pain and mental problems she has, the fact that she tries to still be a good mom and take as good of care of her child as she can with help from family, he says she isnt disable. I know of people that have nothhing wrong with them other than they dont want to work that get ssi/ssd. That is wrong in so many ways. So in short, in his eyes, the fact that she still tries to do right by her child and not be totally dependent on someone else for everything, shes not disable..... Thats just not right. Lets have him walk a day in her shoes and see how well he enjoys it. Mentally, and physically she has been though the ringer and has major medical problems, but like I said it seems because she still tries, she not disable and that she can still work. Trust me, I know my daughter, she has always worked very hard. Long hours and would reather work than ever ask for anyone to help her. So this is a big hit to her pride, and to be told that she is lying, well thats just wrong in so many ways...
Judge: Kyle C Alexander

The chances of getting a fair hearing before this Judge are not good. It almost appears he has a bias toward injured claimants. Any adverse medical opinion will be adopted in his decision.

My claim was denied. Apparently attending college means I do not have a disability. Nevermind the fact that the only reason I am still in school is because of the laundry list of accommodations that my schools "office for students with disabilities" gives me. Unfortunately trying to get an education is a mistake. Maybe it is just a mistake for me given all the students I know that receive assistance from the same office and have been approved. I am going to try and appeal, hopefully the next judge I see will not be her. Maybe she should try and deal with my medical issues for just one week and then tell me I don't have a disability.
Judge: Ken B Terry

I would love to write a book on my experiences with the SSDI process, as has been said to me, it is too unbelievable not to be true. I filed my first claim in May 2003 after being disabled from work for two years. In 2008, my paper file was inadvertantly destroyed, but it took four years for the Advisory Councel to admit this. In March 2013, I was finally able to recieve a hearing and a "fully favorable decision." (NOT REALLY). My hearing was with this judge and I found him to be difficult to testify in front of. He was abrupt and inpatient with my explanations and responses. He seemed unwilling to take simple answers to questions and wanted very long explanations for the most minute situation. The reason for the fully favorable decision was a lot of lawyering by my attorney and a compromise on my part (a huge one to me). It took everything we had (myself and my lawyer) to convince this judge that I was disabled. You need a really incredible lawyer to stand up to this judge.

My wife just received her letter of denial and it is apparent this judge does not know anything about Fybromyalgia or its affects on a person or family, a person can look totally normal on the outside but in lots of pain on the inside. My wife has been suffering with this since the birth of our 2nd child. Judge Terry has not been there to see my wife collapse because half her body was partially paralized, Judge Terry has never had to wake up at different hours of the night to hear your wife crying because her body is in pain, Judge Terry has not had to endure the financial hardship we have faced selling things just to pay doctor bills, Judge Terry has not had to see how disheartening it is to see your wife like that and not able to go walking with the kids or go to a park because of her pain, Judge Terry has not had to witness a whole lot but I believe she made the best decision she could based on the paperwork she had but not on knowledge of this disease. It is very dissappointing when you see someone you love who would give their all to help someone in need go through something like this. My wife would never have written this comment for the Judge because that is the person she is but again I needed to voice our feelings on this matter and I feel these judges need to do a litte more research on this disease. It has been several long years she has had to endure this process only to have an outcome that is as sad as this.

When the vocational expert gave his input, Judge Cutter asked great questions in order to accurately describe my disability. His highly verbal communication skills were an asset to the hearing. Legally, he was very fair and precise and explained himself well. He made his decision and sent me all the information in 8 days! He really must of worked hard to make me less stressed. Thank you Judge Cutter, you are truly one of the great ones in your profession. More people should evaluate you.

former atty for claimants now an intense, smart, egotistical, opinionated, biased, but very well prepared ALJ known to hold grudges. we had a claimant who had been denied by another ALJ but had since gotten worse and had new severe impairments (cervical DDD, lumbar DDD, depression) which we documented with 2 years worth of treatment and tests (MRIs, etc). At hearing and in decision denying claim, ALJ Stam ignored the new problems and acted like claimant made it up. ALJ interruppted questioning by me saying she had already covered that topic, but she had not really. [I was asking specific Qs about Claimant's trouble using her hands]Then stopped my Qs of VE on same topic. AC upheld her denial withou comment.

I agree whole heartedly with the comment that this judge is heartless and disconcerned for the well-being of the claiments. Percentages on this site do not lie. Obviously he only approves less than a quarter of all cases. So if you experience a unfavorable decision from this judge, despite being dishearten with the system, you are not alone! His statistics seem quite unbalanced coupled with a whim of something smelly~ Try to find out before hand who your judge may be before hand because your chances of winning is very slim. In addition if you appeal to council or start all over, its within your rights to request another judge~ God Bless

As a person has been in this business for years, I felt obligated to note that I disagree with the poster below who referred to Judge Merchant in such a disrespectful manner. Yes, he reads the whole record- to include the treatment notes. He does confront the claimants; however, he is very compassionate and respectful to all who come into his hearing room. For future claimants, be wary of what you read on sites like these. Listen to your representative and be truthful.

Twisting evidence, Minimizing the seriousness of the claiments testimony..to the extent of "Poking fun of them", humiliating a person in the determination letter by outright ignoring significant medical details rather highlighting all the non Important information.

Very nice, very helpful, used a vocational expert half the time, but she is old school. Ask some questions but not in order, and does not ask all, you have to be on your toes.

ALJ Merchant is clearly knowledgeable of the SSA statutes and assertive in his hearings. On the conservative side for dispositions, but his decisions do not tend to be unreasonable.

Judge Lisa is wonderful as She askes questions and listens and reviews the medical evidence.She does her job very well indeed.
Judge: C. H Prinsloo
11/9/2012 6:08:31 PM
This man is doing a disservice to people who are really in need and in dire situations, he ignores or overlooks many things that are of benefit to the claimant including VE testimony, letters from a claimants treating physician/specialist whose body of work includes peer reviewed publications in his area of expertise,and medical records that include dozens of hospitalizations for an incapacitating illness. Some ALJ's were only hired, it seems to reduce the back log of cases and are simply on a mission to dispose of cases and doing a shoddy job of it and in the process disregarding the SSA rules, and putting valid claimants lives in jeopardy and causing undue pain and suffering to them and their families. 37% award percentage is disturbing, disgusting and shows a callous disregard for life and human decency. Is there an unspoken contest to see who gets the most remands, or Federal circuit court Judge reversals? Or maybe the NHC's should stop making these ALJ's drive to the hearings in remote locales, perhaps they would be in a better mood and frame of mind in order to serve the public like they should, instead of taking it out on them.

She was a very pleasant lady and judge. I had my hearing October 3 2012, and 9 days later received my fully favorable letter from her.
Judge: Milagros Farnes

A very fine ad conscientious ALJ. She will give you a decent chance. No tricks or traps and straight forward. What more could you ask for?

Great judge if you have a good case with actual evidence. Seemed symoathetic and thoughful. Not so much in cases with weak or missing evidence, an unprepared lawyer, or only the claimant's testimony to prove the illness or injury.
fedup

Judge: J. Dell Gordon
8/15/2012 8:17:33 AM
He is genteel in his mannerisms, but he does not give an indepedent fresh look at a case. He makes up his mind prior to the hearing and the claimant's testimony and additional evidence proving disability is irrelevant. Therefore, he is not open to reversing the government's prior decision. He is essentially a rubber stamp for the government. He gets one star because I can't give him a negative star.
Judge: James B Griffith
8/8/2012 11:24:52 AM
This guy is a *****. He will approve claims, but he the whole process is just weird.

This judge was very sympathetic and empathetic. She was kind, patient, and was willing to listen. I broke down often during the hearing, as the whole ordeal of the past several years has taken a toll on me. I do not WANT to be disabled, but I am. I think she understood that I wasn't just someone looking to avoid work, or trying to get it for an equally undeserving claim. I may get denied, but I do feel that she will be fair. Crossing my fingers at this point, and thanking her for trying to put me at ease, and trying to do her job well. Thanks Judge.

Even though the Vocational expert said I wouldnt be able to keep a job, she denied my claim. So after 21/2 years we still go hungry. Ive worked since I was 14, and now Im too sick to work and they arent there for me. I just dont get it. Ive cried all day and dont know what to do. If this is your ALJ, God help you all.

6/29/2012 8:18:06 AM
very nice judge, never once said a negative word to me. now its just a waiting game for the decision. I have plenty medical records to prove my case but i really believe that in alot of these cases people are in fact disabled but the judge just doesnt wanna hear it. which is wrong in so many ways.i mean when you look at some of these judges approval rates in the low 20% range you pretty much know your chance of getting it is over.

Thorough, precise, articulate, well-spoken, and well-prepared. Don't go into a hearing with this ALJ expecting a cake walk.
Judge: J. Dell Gordon
6/7/2012 2:56:21 PM
Agreeable enough. Not especially well versed in SS regs & rulings. Appears to be of the opinion that in most cases, a "truly" disabled claimant would have already been found disabled at the state agency level (which is laughable to anyone who has any experience in the field). Basically a time-server.
Judge: George W Merchant
5/31/2012 4:46:50 AM
This judge is nonetheless heartless and disconcerned of the well-being of Alabama's disabled citizens.Obviously he gets his income and doesnt think of what clients he presides over need to survive on a daily basis.He did not look at the basic facts of my trial and after waiting for 18 months with no income and the inability to work my case was denied. Being someone with a life-threatening illness I could have filed for another appeal but that would have put me waiting at least another 18 months before it would proceed to the appeals court. Instead I decided to reapply hoping that the seriousness of my disablities would be re-evaluated by someone with a little more understanding of what it is to want to do better for yourself when you cant.

This man is brute because he reported that i was not disabled because I had a Facebook account and could use a computer how in the world did he know that and did he have a computer hacker to hack my Facebook account? not cool in my book, I am disabled, what right does he have to say that I am not, does he feel pain of every minute of his life like I do, has he been raped in a motel for 48 hours, I think not he has no idea of what I have been through, for gods sake i have ptsd because of it!! I had a good job before my rapes, abuse etc I have a college degree and I can't get a job, at my age I should at least get ssi to help with my utility bills..Whatever, John, come rub my neck at night because i sure can't afford a massage therapist,

Iranian Short to Compete in Finland’s Tampere Film Festival
Tweet
TEHRAN (FNA)- Short Film ‘Pedovore’ directed by Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Mahdi Kart has found its way to the competition section of the 49th Tampere Film Festival in Finland at its first international screening.
‘Pedovore’ directed by Mohammad Kart will vie at the international competition section of the 49th Tampere Film Festival in Finland.
“Nobody takes the feeling of love in children seriously, but in the world that is like a Pedovore monster nothing is more beautiful and powerful than a child’s love,” reads the short synopsis of the film.
‘Pedovore’ received a mention for Best Director at the 35th Tehran International Short Film Festival, and is currently taking part at the short film competition section of the 37th Fajr Film Festival in Iran.
Tampere Film Festival is a short film festival held in the Finnish city of Tampere. It is accredited by the film producers' society FIAPF, and the winning films will be introduced to the Oscars.
Over 4000 films from all over the world were submitted to the International Competition section of the Finnish festival, 59 of which were selected from 47 countries.
The 49th edition of the festival will be held on 6-10 March, 2019.
Iranian cinema has made great progress in the past 40 years since the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, to that extent that many Iranian films bring home numerous international awards every year and Iranian directors and their films are well known in all cultural venues across the globe.

Entangled States
The Titanic led to licenses for radio operators. Internet next?
July 7, 2011
by Nicholas Knisely	
Web/Tech	
I love articles that make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. (I loved the PBS series “Connections” back in the day; if there’s a single major influence on my preaching and writing, it’s that.) There’s a piece on Ars Technica today that shows how the irresponsible behavior of amateur radio operators during the time of the search and rescue operation following the Titanic’s sinking has lead us to the bizarre anti-competitive world of today’s mobile industry in the U.S.
And it’s worth reading for that alone.
But I was particularly taken with this passage describing what it was like on the radio airwaves in the first couple of decades of the last century:
“One has to admit that some of the antics of these Morse code boys are amusing, at least in retrospect. “Some amateurs deliberately sent false or obscene message, especially to the navy,” Douglas notes. “The temptation to indulge in such practical joking was enhanced by the fact that detection was virtually impossible. Amateurs would pretend to be military officials or commercial operators, and they dispatched ships on all sorts of fabricated missions.”
The navy didn’t think any of this was funny, of course. During one cited emergency, naval officials complained that they had to fight with amateurs to get control of a frequency. When a coastal operator told a Boston ham to “butt out” of the signal, he was told to get lost right back.
“Say, you navy people think you own the ether,” the amateur retorted. “Who ever heard of the navy anyway. Beat it, you, beat it.”
As radio historian Jesse Walker observes, the government also resented these boys because they were better trained and had superior equipment. “The hams’ anarchic meritocracy outperformed the navy’s society of status,” Walker writes, “sometimes relaying rescue messages that the official radiomen had missed or mangled. This didn’t exactly boost the seamen’s self-image.””
More here.
Sound like Lulz or Anonymous? Does to me.
When I was in 7th grade I got my novice ham radio license. I didn’t really do much with it because I couldn’t afford a transceiver. I did have a receiver and I’d practice my code skills listening in on traffic. What I really liked though was listening to the news from other countries. I was fascinated by the different spin the BBC, VOA, Radio Moscow, etc, would put on different events. I suppose I still do that today though I use the Internet for my fix.
That’s part of the problem with amateur radio these days too. Most of the people who would have been part of the hobby are now online and have little interest in learning morse code or electronics. They’d rather use email or hang out on web forums.
I’m taken though with the parallels between the early radio scene and the present Internet. Both promise an illusion of anonymity and both therefore seem to allow people a chance to play out irresponsible behavior in a way that think they don’t have to be responsible for in the end.
The problem though is that both situations are ultimately not anonymous. With radio there’s such a thing as a directional antenna, and with three of them it’s a pretty straightforward exercise to find the transmitting antenna. Then you just need to follow the cord to find the operator.
The Internet is also not actually anonymous – at least not the way we think of it as being. Every computer is assigned a unique identifier when it connects to the network. It’s possible to camouflage yourself, but if someone really really wants to find you, they can. You’re not nearly as anonymous as you think you are. If you do something egregiously bad, you’re pretty likely to be discovered eventually.
The government solved the radio problem with licenses. It worked at the time though these days its becoming more and more of a mess. I wouldn’t be totally surprised if some sort of regulatory solution isn’t soon proposed for Internet usage. Especially in these days when major corporations (the really important individuals in America these days at least politically speaking) are getting black eyes left and right as pranksters and amateur operators hack into their systems and repeatedly embarrass them.
And given how well copyright has worked out for individuals and for encouraging artistic expression of late, I expect the solutions proposed for Internet use will be about as useful.

WA7GME here but I don’t think the internet will be having the same rules as ham radio there is just to many people the number assigned when you go on line can hang you if you do bad things. Maybe a static IP address would be the thing, but are there that many numbers in the universe. Maybe it will be like the chicken band , er citizen band radio lots of regulations but no enforcement unless you really do really bad things.

I think you’re right that it won’t be the same as ham regulations, but I suspect there’s going to be more policing of Internet behavior. Though, there are interesting and important first amendment rights that are in play here in a way that were taken less seriously in the ham regulatory moment.
I think it will probably come down to requiring all ISP’s to retain logs of every IP and MAC network card address – perhaps even requiring that routers do that for wifi access points.
That will be easier with IPv6 – no more NAT’ing to share scarce IP numbers. Everyone and everything will have its own unique code.

I remember listening to music on that old radio, too, amid a mass of science equipment! Must be a y-chromosome thing – Ben’s room is totally filled with electronic equipment of one variety or another, his mostly to record rather than transmit sound.

I think Connections is still one of the best examples of using television as the medium it was meant to be.
Of course, for the scenario you suggest to really play out analogously, there would have to be some kind of iceberg.

Connections, the Day the Universe Changed, etc were just amazing, and I’ve only known a handful of people who seem to remember them. I’m glad to hear of another friend who was/is influenced and impressed by James Burke’s unpacking of this arcane scientific minutiae. What I take from it is that there is hope for us that the little bit of good we might do in the world might translate into a much better world somewhere down the line, even if our actions don’t bear immediate fruit.
As to the “illusion of anonymity” and all the rest, doesn’t technology usually find ways to address its own shortcomings more quickly than top-down solutions can be implemented? It seems to me that many complex systems work this way, so I wonder if our efforts might be better spent elsewhere . . .
Nick Knisely says

Martin, thanks for comment. Just to be clear, I’m not arguing in favor of regulations at all. I think we’ve discovered how bad the unintended consequences of a regulatory solution can be in the radio world. I’m worried though that congress won’t have many other arrows in their collective quivers to try to hit the mark on this issue in our day. Top-down is what Congress sort of has to do by default I think.

Really enjoyed this article. You kind of have to feel sorry for the navy though 😉

It’s not good to be Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) right now.
The self-described Democrat Socialist is making news for all the wrong reasons and has even been called out by members of her own party.
Now, the country’s largest organized labor group is telling AOC that her “Green New Deal” is bad news for America.

Yes, they're supposedly the party against hate, so they have to.
No, intersectional politics rule the Democrat party, so Omar wins.
I don't really care what they do. The Democrat party is all bad anyway.

The AFL-CIO, America’s largest organized-labor group, slammed socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) Green New Deal in a letter to her and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), stating that the far-left plan could “cause immediate harm to millions of our members and their families.”
“We welcome the call for labor rights and dialogue with labor, but the Green New Deal resolution is far too short on specific solutions that speak to the jobs of our members and the critical sections of our economy,” the letter from the AFL-CIO Energy Committee states. “It is not rooted in an engineering-based approach and makes promises that are not achievable or realistic.”
“We will not accept proposals that could cause immediate harm to millions of our members and their families,” the letter continued. “We will not stand by and allow threats to our members’ jobs and their families’ standard of living go unanswered.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” if somehow passed by Congress, was thought to have cost U.S. taxpayers tens of trillions of dollars.
A new report suggests the real number could nearly hit $100 trillion.
That would come to, roughly, $650,000 per American household.
From Daily Wire:
Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) “Green New Deal” — a massive government takeover of large portions of the U.S. economy — is projected to cost up to $93 trillion.
Bloomberg reports that Ocasio-Cortez’s far-left plan would “tally between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10-years, concludes American Action Forum, which is run by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who directed the non-partisan CBO from 2003 to 2005.”
The enormous price tag, which amounts to over $650,000 per U.S. household, covers a low-carbon electricity grid, net zero emissions transportation system, guaranteed jobs, universal health care, guaranteed green housing, and food security.
AOC’s words on her “black staff”…
We have Black staff. We don’t parade them around to show the world how diverse our team is, and use that as some kind of evidence of the absence of racism. That’s what tokenism is.

A member of Hillary Clinton’s communications team decided to weigh-in on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” which would cost taxpayers tens of trillions.
AOC, herself, then gave her two cents.
Finally, pro-Trump actor James Woods dropped the hammer.
Charlotte Clymer wrote:
It’s really this simple: if you’ve got a better than what @AOC is offering to combat climate change, please show it. If you’re a Member of Congress who can effectively address climate change better than the #GreenNewDeal, show your receipts. Make an effort.

Ocasio-Cortez’s response to Clymer:
Yup. If you don’t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis.
Until then, we’re in charge – and you’re just shouting from the cheap seats.

Enter James Woods, who absolutely ripped “arrogant idiot” AOC a new one:
So, you may have missed this, but the way it works in America is YOU work for US. The last time somebody told Americans to sit down and shut up was 1776. If you ever learn to read, look it up. You are not only a idiot, you’re an arrogant idiot, and there is nothing more dangerous

He just gave Alexandria a history lesson she’s not likely to forget anytime soon.

Michael Avenatti’s Troubles are Far From Over Says Famous Former Client

Yesterday was a bad day for celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti. Actually, that’s a bit of an understatement. Yesterday was a terrible day for Michael Avenatti. The man famously nicknamed “creepy porn lawyer” by Tucker Carlson was hit with two separate sets of charges, on each coast of this beautiful nation, stemming from illegal activities in which he attempted to “shake down” Nike. Now, Avenatti’s most famous client to date, Stormy Daniels, wants the world to know that this may very well be only the tip of the iceberg of her former lawyer’s sins. https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1110240069619572738 Avenatti had done a poor job in recent months of reversing any stereotypes that people may have concerning lawyers, that’s for certain. In a statement yesterday, Avenatti was brief and terse, spending much of his time behind the microphone thanking the authorities involved for their professionalism.

Dems and Trump Agree: Release As Much of The Mueller Report as Possible
When Trump and the democrats agree on something, but Mitch McConnell doesn’t, where do we go from here?

It isn’t very often that you’ll find Donald Trump and a majority of the democratic party on the same page…especially in regard to the Russian “collusion” conspiracy theory. For nearly two years the democrats, along with their lapdogs in the “infotainment” industry, had already precluded that Donald Trump was some sort of Russian double agent, handpicked by the Kremlin to rise to the highest office in the land in order to do Vladimir Putin’s bidding. Yes, it was absurd, and yes, we’re glad that Robert Mueller sorted that out for us. Now, the democrats, the American people, and Donald Trump all seem to agree: Show us the report. The republicans, on the other hand, seem hesitant. House Democrats pressed the Justice Department to provide the full report from special counsel Robert Mueller even as Republicans gleefully called for them to “move on” from the Russia investigation . President Donald Trump accused those responsible for launching Mueller’s probe of “treasonous things against our country” and said they “certainly will be looked into.” Trump said the release of Mueller’s full report “wouldn’t bother me at all,” and Democrats quickly put that statement to the test, demanding that his administration hand over the entire document and not just Sunday’s four-page summary from Attorney General William Barr. The President has said on several occasions that releasing the entire report would be amenable to him, as he maintains his innocence in the matter. Mitch McConnell yesterday struck down an attempt to make the entire report public – a move that has raised some eyebrows among Trump supporters and other conservatives.

The FREEDOM CHOICE 5K PPO is a dental plan that can help you save1 and get the care you need.
No matter who your dentist may be, with the MetLife Preferred Dentist Program, the power to choose and save is yours.
Here are the facts:
You can go to any licensed dentist, in or out of the network.
Reimbursement for your out-of-network dental care is based on the 90th percentile of “reasonable and customary” charges1. We look at what dentists in your area actually charge for services, and we calculate reimbursement based on the 90th percentile of those charges.
The way we determine allowable charges for the 90th R&C means your eligible benefit amount for out-of-network care is high relative to average dental charges in the community. This helps you pay less out of pocket.
Sometimes when you visit an out-of-network dentist you may have to pay part of the bill. This is called balance billing. But with a 90th percentile R&C plan, in most cases, you won’t be balance billed above your typical out-of-pocket costs – your deductible, coinsurance amount, and your plan maximum.
Take charge of your dental care
Talk to your dentist
Before you get any major dental work, you should talk to your dentist about getting a pretreatment estimate2. That’s when your dentist sends the plan for your care to MetLife.
For most procedures, you and your dentists will receive the estimate – online or by fax – during your visit. The statement shows amounts for what your plan covers. Then you and your dentist can talk about your care and costs before your treatment. It’s a great way to be prepared and plan ahead.
Get your plan information – fast!
Managing your dental benefits has never been easier. You’ve got MyBenefits – your secure member website. Just log on at www.metlife.com/mybenefits. With the 24/7 website you can3:
Review your plan information, including what’s covered and coinsurance
Track your deductible and plan maximums
Find a dentist or view your claim history
Read up on the oral health information you need to make informed decisions about your care
Take a look at the charts below. They will give you a better idea of how your plan works when you visit a participating (in-network) or a non-participating (out-of-network) dentist.
The 90th bar
This chart shows how often plan members across the nation usually go to a participating or non-participating dentist. It also shows just how rare it is for you to pay more than your typical out-of-pocket costs.
Savings example
This hypothetical example shows that whether you get a cleaning from a participating or non-participating dentist, you can still save money4.
Visit any licensed dentist. The choice is all yours!
Like most group benefit programs, benefit programs offered by MetLife and its affiliates contain certain exclusions, exceptions, waiting periods, reductions of benefits, limitations, and terms for keeping them in force. Please contact MetLife or your Plan Administrator for complete details.
Form more information, click here.
1R&C fee refers to the Reasonable and Customary (R&C) charge, which is based on the lowest of 1) the dentist’s actual charge, 2) the dentist’s usual charge for the
same or similar services or the usual charge of most dentists in the same geographic area for the same or similar services as determined by MetLife.
2Actual benefit determinations are made when services are rendered and are subject to the following as applicable on the date of service: patient eligibility; plan and frequency limitations; maximums and deductibles; and other coverages.
3With the exception of scheduled or unscheduled systems maintenance or interruptions, the MyBenefits website is typically available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
4Please note: This is a hypothetical example that reviews an adult teeth cleaning (D1110) in the Chicago area, zip 60601. It assumes that the annual deductible has been met.
5This example excludes non-participating dentists who charge more than what 90% of what other dentists in the area charge. Please note that if you receive care from a dentist that falls into this category, your out-of-pocket costs may be higher.
6Negotiated Fee refers to the fees that in-network dentists have agreed to accept as payment in full, subject to any co-payments, deductibles, cost sharing and benefits maximums.

Senate panel to take up school guns proposal

Designated people would be allowed to carry concealed firearms on school grounds under a bill added to the agenda of a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting next week. The bill (SB 1236), filed by Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, was put on the agenda Thursday, a day after 17 people were killed by a gunman at a Broward County high school.
The committee will meet Tuesday. The proposal would allow school principals or school superintendents to designate people who could carry guns during school hours. People receiving the designation would have to meet training and background requirements. The proposal also would require schools to receive “active shooter situation training” conducted by a law enforcement agency and to undergo safety and emergency reviews every three years by law enforcement.
The Judiciary Committee in recent years has repeatedly blocked a other firearm-related measures, such as proposals to allow people with concealed-weapons licenses to carry guns on college and university campuses or to openly carry handguns. However, the committee last month narrowly approved a measure (SB 1048) that would allow people with concealed-weapons licenses to carry guns on the grounds of churches and other religious institutions that include schools.
That church-related proposal is scheduled to go to the full Senate next week. The Judiciary Committee is slated to take up Baxley’s measure after Senate leaders Thursday announced a $100 million education proposal that includes money for mental-health training, screening and counseling in the wake of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.

Former Vice President Joe Biden rallied Democratic voters on the campus of the University of South Florida, telling them that they had a chance to vote in the first black governor in the state’s history, Andrew Gillum.
“Don’t tell me that things can’t change. Don’t tell me that won’t happen,” Biden said. “It’s time. It’s time. It’s time.”-Joe Biden (Tampa Bay Times)
Gillum leads DeSantis by a few percentage points with two weeks until election day, but with Republicans holding decent size edge in absentee ballots casts, it looks as if the race for governor is going to come down to the wire.
“I want you to follow your dreams.”

“I want to be the kind of state where you don’t have to be on the first plane out of here…I want you to be able to choose to build your life right here in the state of Florida.”-Andrew Gillum
What Gillum can do, DeSantis will try to do better. DeSantis who has the full support of President Trump, will host a rally in Jacksonville this Thursday with Vice President Mike Pence.

Joining Gillum and Biden on stage was Senator Bill Nelson. Nelson has enjoyed a bit of an uptick in his campaign polling after the Gillum his primary election.
Before the primaries, Republican Governor Rick Scott was leading Nelson, but as soon as Gillum won, a “Blue Wave” of sorts among Florida’s Democratic voting base came alive.
This excitement for Gillum has all-but saved Nelson, but the recent polls show a tighter race with some showing Nelson only by a few points.
By being governor, Rick Scott has benefitted from unprecedented free earned media do to the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. Nelson has also garnered some coverage, but not anywhere near the amount that Scott has.

How Industrial Agriculture Affects Our Soil
Soil is the foundation of most types of agriculture. But soil health is negatively impacted by industrial agriculture practices like monocropping, synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and more.
share:
In soil-based agriculture, soil health is the most important foundation of a healthy farm ecosystem. Yet most of the common farming techniques employed in industrial crop production, such as synthetic fertilizer application and monocropping, can degrade soil over time, causing a cascade of problems necessitating the use of even more man-made inputs, which in turn contribute to climate change. Sustainable and regenerative agriculture seeks to ameliorate soil health, sequestering carbon, storing water and building healthier farm ecosystems along the way.
What Is Soil?
Soil forms the surface of the Earth. It is made up of various mixtures (depending on where one lives) of minerals, water, air and organic material (including microbes and other organisms). 1
Soil is not static: its composition is changeable, based on the weather, which organisms constitute it, which plants grow in it, and more. 2 Soil, like air and water, is also vulnerable to pollution and can be damaged by industrial farming practices. Soil can also be amended through sustainable practices, like applying compost.
Soils are often thought of as “living” because so many different types of organisms are alive in them, from bacteria to fungi to earthworms. In fact, one teaspoon of healthy soil can contain as many as one billion bacteria, plus fungi, protozoa and nematodes. 3 Healthy organisms in soil — both large (e.g., earthworms) and small (e.g., bacteria) — are important, because they perform many functions, from aeration, to creating pockets in the soil for water, to breaking down organic material and making nutrients available for plants. 4
While soil is technically a renewable resource, it can take (pending the climate) between 100 and 1,000 years to develop — and this formation is so slow, that scientists apply the term “limited” to it, because although it is a natural resource, it is vulnerable to degradation. 5
The Impact of Industrial Agriculture on Soil Health
Industrial agriculture negatively affects soil health and the atmosphere, by reducing organic matter and releasing carbon.
The Effect of Monocropping on Soil Health
Monocropping is the practice of growing the same crop on the same plot of land, year after year. This practice depletes the soil of nutrients (making the soil less productive over time), reduces organic matter in soil and can cause significant erosion. 6 In the US, industrial farming practices often include the rotation of soybeans and corn. Technically, because two crops are in rotation, this does not get classified as a “monoculture.” However, this “simple” form of crop rotation does not provide the same benefit to the soil as do complex systems (in which three or more crops are rotated over a period of one year or longer). 7 When crops are grown in complex rotation, yields go up by as much as 10 percent in a non-drought year. 8
Monocropping, or even the “simple” crop rotation mentioned above, causes a cascade of problems, necessitating not only the use of synthetic fertilizers (because soil becomes depleted), but also the use of pesticides to control pests, like soil fungi, insects and other agricultural nuisances. Fields that include a diversity of crops (polyculture) are less attractive to insect predators. 9
Soil scientists have also discovered that monocropping alters the microbial landscape of soil, decreasing beneficial microbes and causing poor plant growth over time. 10
Synthetic Fertilizers Negatively Impact Soil Health
All plants need nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for healthy growth and productivity. These macronutrients (in addition to other macro- and micronutrients) form the basis of healthy soils. For soils deficient in these nutrients, fertilizer — either made synthetically or from organic materials — must be applied to grow healthy plants. As industrial crop production has escalated during the last 50 years, so has the application of synthetic fertilizers (mainly produced from fossil fuels) to boost plant productivity, in part. Industrial farming practices, such as monocropping and intensive tillage, have also compromised soil health over time.
Some research has found that synthetic nitrogen fertilizer application decreases soil’s microbiological diversity (that is, bacteria, fungi, etc.) or alters its natural microbiological composition in favor of more pathological strains. 1112 Some types of nitrogen fertilizer can cause soil acidification, which can affect plant growth. 13 Excessive fertilizer use can also cause a buildup of salts in soil, heavy metal contamination and accumulation of nitrate (which is a source of water pollution and also harmful to humans). 14
(It should be noted that synthetic fertilizer use isn’t just detrimental to soil: it also contributes to climate change and to water pollution through the release of N2O, causing severe algal blooms in several agricultural areas of the US. Learn More)
Pesticide Residues in Soil
Pesticides are chemicals that are used to control weeds (herbicides), insects (insecticides) and fungi (fungicides) in food, fiber and wood production.
Pesticide residues in soil, and their lasting presence in the soil over time, are greatly influenced by both the soil type and composition, as well as by the pesticide type. 15 Depending on the pesticide type, application quantity, soil quality and the environment, some pesticides may be broken down by microbial action in the soil or by other chemical reactions, while others can accumulate in soil. 16 (It is important to note, however, that some pesticides’ metabolites [breakdown products] are more toxic than the “parent” pesticide. 17)

Some studies show that glyphosate (also known as RoundUp) decreases microbial biodiversity in soil; other studies show this chemical’s adverse effects on earthworms. 18 Other types of pesticides may have similar effects on soil microbiology, impacting nitrogen-fixing microbes important to soil health and fertility. 19
Soil fumigants are a type of pesticide designed to kill organisms in the soil before farmers start to plant. Fumigants kill nearly all soil organisms — not just the harmful ones — including beneficial bacteria, fungi and other organisms that help maintain healthy soils. (In addition to killing soil organisms, many of these soil fumigants are toxic to human health and can escape into the environment after application. Read more in the FoodPrint of Crop Production report .) In some cases, as in the production of grapes, fumigants accumulate in soils, often at levels beyond legal limits, also affecting soil microbial health and earthworms, both of which are vitally important to soil health and fertility. 2021
Factory Farm Waste Contaminates Soils
Animal waste from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), also known as factory farms, spread on agricultural fields can contain harmful microbes and antibiotic and other pharmaceutical residues, which can lead to antibiotic resistant bacteria in soils. 2223 Antibiotics can stay in soil from a few days to hundreds of days. Some studies show that certain classes of antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, can be taken up by crops. 24
Application of animal waste from industrial animal facilities can also be a cause of heavy metal contamination (stemming from metals used in feed), including copper, zinc and lead. 25
Tillage, Soil Compaction and Erosion
Mechanical tillage and the use of heavy farm equipment can cause both soil compaction and soil erosion if soils are not managed effectively. Soil compaction is caused by heavy farm machinery use and tilling when soils are too wet; compaction has become an increasing problem as farm equipment has gotten increasingly heavier. 2627 Compaction leads to poor water absorption and poor aeration which further lead to stunted root growth in plants and smaller yields. 28
In agriculture, soil erosion usually refers to topsoil particles wearing away through wind, water and through farming activities, like tillage. 29 Erosion is caused by many different factors, but poor soil management, including tilling, can cause significant erosion over time, as can practices such as not planting cover crops in winter and not mulching. 30 Tillage erosion can cause both wind and water erosion as poorly-managed soils are more susceptible to both. 31
Soil erosion is a problem for several reasons. When topsoil (the portion containing natural nutrients and organic material, which plants need to thrive) is lost, soil fertility is lost. In some cases, this loss causes a change in the structure of agricultural soils, which can, in turn, lead to increased susceptibility to drought. 32 Eroded soil can turn into runoff and wash into local waterways, carrying not only soil particles, but any contaminants in that soil (such as synthetic fertilizer and pesticides). 33 Wind erosion can cause significant topsoil loss, as well as health problems, property damage, and harm to crops. 34 Erosion can also be a cause of flooding, as damaged soil cannot absorb as much water as healthy soil.
Soil Tillage, Climate Change and Soil Carbon Sequestration
Soil stores a tremendous amount of carbon; nearly 80 percent of the carbon in terrestrial ecosystems is in soil. 35 Local loss of soil-sequestered carbon has global consequences. Scientists estimate that approximately one-third of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (a major contributor to climate change), are from the clearing of forests and the cultivation of land for agriculture. 36 Unsustainable agricultural techniques which cause erosion, such as excessive tillage, and which do not improve soil health (e.g., soil microbes and organic matter), hasten the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 37
The Benefits of Sustainable Agriculture for Soil Health
The negative impact of industrial agriculture production (both industrial crop production and industrial animal production) on soil health are many. But an alternative exists. Sustainable agricultural techniques can help build healthy soil, avoiding the need for heavy synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use while protecting natural biodiversity in healthy soil. Here are just some of the major benefits that sustainable agricultural practices have on soil health:
Improved carbon sequestration — regenerative agricultural techniques, like cover cropping, can help build soil and sequester carbon. Healthy, carbon-rich soil plays an indispensable role in the fight against climate change. 38
Improved water retention — healthy soils with high organic matter retain more water. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, “Each 1 percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold 20,000 gallons more water per acre.” 39
Less need for pesticides — healthy plants grown in biologically diverse soil with plenty of microbes are less susceptible (or attractive) to plant pests and better able to defend themselves from attack. 40
No need for synthetic fertilizer — using sustainable soil-improvement techniques can eliminate the need for synthetic, fossil-fuel-based fertilizers. For example, amending the soil with plant-based compost and animal manure, green manure and cover cropping, as well as employing crop rotation, can all contribute to building healthier soil
How Farmers Create Healthy Soils in Sustainable Systems
Regenerative farming techniques are focused on building soil health through ecosystem-centered techniques, like composting and adding animals into their crop rotation practices. This contrasts with the industrial model, which strips soil of nutrients and results in a negative feedback loop that requires more and more inputs, like synthetic fertilizers, over time. Sustainable farmers use many different techniques to create and maintain healthy soil structure, rich in nutrients, in sustainable agricultural systems without the use of synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. These techniques include:
Crop rotation
The use of compost
Green manure, cover cropping and mulching
No-till or low-till techniques
Limited to zero pesticide use and sustainable pest management techniques, such as using buffer zones and beneficial insects
Adding animals on pasture/animal manure to farm systems and crop rotation

Woody Biomass
By Barbara Coyner
Are mountain pine beetles working faster than ever to devour western forests because of climate change? Is woody biomass energy carbon neutral? Does logging ultimately benefit or harm the forests in the face of extensive beetle outbreaks?
These questions keep plenty of scientists — and activists — busy these days, with opinions and studies varying wildly. How can we find the truth, especially if some people seem determined to limit woody biomass as an option for renewable energy?
Suspicions
In an October 30, 2011 article in the Salt Lake Tribune, Kirk Robinson, executive director of the Western Wildlife Conservancy, was questioned on forest health and utilization of woody biomass. The article, entitled “Amid beetle plague, turning trees to wood chips could be western forests’ salvation,” focused on logging western forests to revitalize them, while at the same time using the woody residues for energy production.
Robinson’s reply is not unusual among environmentalists: “What I really hate to see is people finding excuses to exploit nature. I am very suspicious of biomass projects for that reason.” He bases his conclusions on a 2010 report by the Oregon-based National Center for Conservation Science and Policy that questions accelerated logging as a means of truly benefitting forests hit by bug kill. Citing findings from a group of Colorado conservation biologists that bug infestation is being driven by climate change, Robinson concludes that logging does little to challenge the problem.
Investment
Meanwhile, in the same time frame, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsak was out west recently, handing out $80 million in research funds to Washington State University and University of Washing-ton for woody biomass research. And
according to various industry publications, millions of dollars are being budgeted for new woody biomass plants across the nation, with the world’s largest biomass gasification plant already being built in Finland.
According to Biomass Power and Thermal Magazine, the global demand for wood pellets, currently estimated at 10 million metric tons, could increase six-fold by 2020. Much of that growth comes from the European Union, where the carbon issue seems to be more settled, with many coal-to-biomass conversions currently in the works.
Some pellet manufacturers in the United States are anticipating the lion’s share of their business will be abroad. Where will they get the woody biomass for the pellets and new power plants? North American forests perhaps? Canada has already unapologetically moved ahead with logging many of its bug-killed forests, deciding that pairing forest health with woody biomass power is a no-brainer.
Confusion
Clearly uncertainty lingers in the U.S., and people like Kirk Robinson are not alone in their opinions when it comes to using woody biomass as green energy. The Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences out of Massachusetts, for example, drew an avalanche of pro and con comments when it released its 2010 study.
One controversial aspect was how the study evaluated forest life cycles. The findings concluded that utilization of woody biomass isn’t carbon neutral, prompting some to argue that the uniqueness of forest life cycles makes it hard to compare woody biomass to fossil fuels. The study raised the subject of sustainability, as well, noting that overharvest of forests could be a downside to woody biomass energy.
Increased Emissions… or Not
Enter scientists from Oregon State University who went public with their evaluation around Halloween. In a four-year study OSU describes as the largest and most comprehensive to date, researchers say managing the forests for biofuel production will increase carbon dioxide emissions from the forests by at least 14 percent.
“Most people assume that wood bioenergy will be carbon-neutral, because the forest regrows, and there’s also the chance of protecting forests from carbon emissions due to wildfire,” researcher Tara Hudiburg said in an OSU news release. But the study shows removing forest debris for bioenergy use will release more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than current practices of burning it or leaving it in place, she said. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, involved 80 types of forests in 19 regions of Oregon, Washington, and California, ranging from wet coastal forests to semi-arid woodlands.
David Tenny, president of the National Alliance of Forest Owners, was quick with a rebuttal, saying the study’s findings are based on wild assumptions. “One of the common threads of studies like this one is that the outcome all depends on these up-front assumptions,” he said online. “In this case, they look at the potential of treating five percent of the forests in the region, for a 20-year rotation of treatments, adding that on top of what they call ‘business as usual’ forest management practices.”
Tenny continued, noting, “You have to think about whether that even makes sense as an assumption. Looking at it another way, five percent of all of the 200 million acres of forestland in the Northwest area is 10 million acres more than what we’re already doing out there. Comparatively, the U.S. Forest Service with its 155 million acres of national forest system lands, and the U.S. Department of Interior land, which is a couple hundred million acres, in their best year combined were able to treat 1.4 million acres of forestland.”
Tenny and others additionally note that there isn’t infrastructure to process such huge volumes, and the industry doesn’t consider such drastic activities on the land as prudent anyway. In other words, forest professionals are not out to clear cut the woods for woody biomass power.
Clearly the disconnect in considering woody biomass as a viable green energy continues. Given the wide discrepancies in opinions and findings, science is anything but settled in the matter, making the term “exact science” something of an oxymoron.

U.S. special forces are now assisting the Philippines military in the battle against Islamic State fighters after militants seized the city of Marawi.
These forces have been deployed at the request of the Philippine government to help take Marawi back, to prevent the terror group from gaining a hold in the country. However, the U.S. will refrain from ground fighting, Reuters reports.
U.S. forces are limited to technical support at this time and surveillance aircraft, particularly the P-3C Orion and RQ-20 Puma Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

So far, dozens of government troops and ISIS militants have died fighting for control over Marawi. Thirteen Philippines Marines died in combat Friday. When ISIS-loyal militants from terror groups Abu Sayyaf and Maute seized Marawi in May, they burned down churches, schools and butchered Christians. They then released a shocking image of the executions.
Despite airstrikes, the Philippines military is finding it difficult to rout out the ISIS militants, as these fighters make use of anti-tank weapons and take shelter in bomb-proof tunnels. They also use human shields, a tactic commonly used by ISIS troops facing heavy assault in Iraq and Syria.
The Pentagon told CNN that special forces have operated in the Philippines for years, and at any time, there are 50-100 troops on the ground.
Although the U.S. is providing military support, the long-standing alliance between the U.S. and the Philippines has been on somewhat shaky ground as of late because of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s loud remarks about pivoting to China and Russia. In a recent interview with RT in May, Duterte stated he wanted a closer relationship with China and Russia, as the Western world engages in “double talk.”
“I have nothing against America, [US President Donald] Trump is my friend,” Duterte said. “But my foreign policy has shifted. I want to deal with China and Russia. Because in Western world, it’s double talk.”
“You treat me as if I’m your colony still. You must be kidding! We’re an independent country. I want my country to be treated with dignity,” Duterte added.

Alert! Black-out on breast cancer info
The Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services removed the bulk of its information on breast cancer from the government website. The Office on Women's Health main page on breast cancer disappeared, along with fact sheets and information covering symptoms, treatment, risk factors, and public no- or low-cost cancer screening programs. The removal of this lifesaving information was neither announced nor explained, and the content has not been re-posted elsewhere.

Nurses and midwives on the frontlines of care

This is the vision of Nursing Now, a new campaign launched to elevate the role of nurses and midwives to bring us closer to achieving the goal of universal health care by the year 2020.

International Women’s Day and Rohingya women
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugee women are suffering in crowded camps, with poor water and sanitation, trying to care for themselves and their children. Because rape is a weapon of the Myanmar military, thousands of Rohingya women are pregnant and in desperate need of reproductive care and other women's health services. But in the refugee camps, women's healthcare is minimal or nonexistent.

New publication: Problems with the Eyes and Seeing
Worldwide, 80% of blindness and poor vision could be prevented or corrected. Many people with early stages of vision problems don't seek care because they don't recognize the symptoms, lack insurance, or have other more immediate concerns. Community health workers are uniquely placed to provide education around eye health, prevent problems from developing, and quickly treat common eye problems.

You can act against cancer
Information about cancer -- what causes it, how to prevent and treat it -- saves lives. We can actually prevent up to 50% of all cancers (WHO), but prevention information is often too hard to understand for people, either using difficult vocabulary, out of context for their access to healthcare or living standards, or assuming they have choices that are foreign to their reality.

Health Guides for RPCVs Working with Refugees
A growing fear of deportation is preventing many refugees and immigrants in the US from seeking healthcare and other services, making these materials more important than ever. To address this problem, the US Gratis initiative is sending free health guides in English and Spanish to organizations that support refugee and immigrant communities.

Global Gag Rule denies women’s right to health
Shortly after taking office, the Trump administration reinstated the Global Gag Rule, designed to cut US funding to any organization that provides abortion services. This expanded version is more disastrous for global health than any prior iteration. Not only does it cut funding to organizations for abortions, it slashes all US government funding - close to $9 billion - to organizations that offer a range of non-abortion related health services if they also provide, refer, or even just counsel about abortion.

Hesperian wins award to support reproductive health for Rohingya refugees
Close to 1 million Rohingya people have been forced from their homes in Myanmar in a tragic ethnic genocide. The Rohingya are a minority Muslim population in a majority-Buddhist country and have suffered execution, rape, and other unthinkable cruelties as they have been driven into exile to Bangladesh, where overwhelming needs for food security, sanitation, and basic healthcare sideline reproductive health needs.

Teaching Them to Fish
After years of Medical Mission work, I found myself asking “What do they do when we are gone?” Fortunately I stumbled upon the Hesperian book Where There is No Doctor. I was so inspired by the concept of allowing the villagers to learn to manage their own health. So, I started a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose was to form a community health program.

Health needs at home
Across the US, volunteers and community leaders are stepping up to serve their neighbors who are increasingly being denied health care, or rightfully afraid to seek the care they need. Headlines report the most jarring cases: a young girl in Texas picked up by immigration agents while traveling for emergency surgery; immigrants afraid to make routine doctor visits. Every day, across the country, similar stories are playing out.

Four years later
Four years ago the world watched as 1,134 people lost their lives in the deadly Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh. In the wake of the disaster, 200 brand name clothing retailers responded to public pressure by signing on to the more effective Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety and the less effective Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. Both agreements bound the participating retailers to fund safety inspections and improvements at the Bangladeshi factories that supply them with product.

School vouchers harm kids with and without disabilities
The confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education has again raised the controversial topic of school vouchers.

Heart disease doesn’t have to be the number one killer
Heart diseases kill more of the world's people than anything else. Strikingly, three quarters of those deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. With the right resources and support, including regular primary health care, the risk factors for cardiovascular disease could be detected, people treated, and lives extended instead of being cut tragically short. Unfortunately, without access to regular, affordable health care, illness is caught too late, after the disease has progressed and treatment is not available or is too expensive.

Police Violence Is a Public Health Issue
Brutality and shootings by police are now getting more attention than ever, but police violence has been all too common for too long. Coverage in social media and even the mainstream press has greatly expanded, particularly for typically marginalized communities such as transgender people and people of color, as offenses are increasingly filmed or photographed, shared, and protested, often through the organizing of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Family planning info shouldn’t be kept a secret
For many women and girls around the world, reliable and accurate family planning and reproductive health information is extremely difficult to find.

Dr. King is still right: Our needs are labor’s needs
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Of all forms of discrimination and inequalities, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman." Fighting for economic, racial, or reproductive justice is made all the more challenging when faced with the triple threat of increased illness, inadequate resources to find care, and discrimination in care. People with more resources are better equipped to fend off health problems, while poor people and historically marginalized groups are stuck with what they’ve got.

2018: A New Year’s Look at New Technologies in Clean
Looking Back and Looking Ahead at the Latest Cleaning Innovations
As we start looking to the new year ahead, it’s important to keep in mind all the new changes and advances both in the past few months and expected to impact the world of clean in the months ahead. There has been a great deal of advancement over the past year in the way we approach cleaning, so here at Hotsy Minnesota, we wanted to recap some of the latest innovations, the newest technologies and what to look for on the horizon.
Steam Power
While “steam” might make you think of old steamboats or trains from the 1800s, but in actuality it’s got a lot of power in the modern realm of cleaning. Steam cleaning with a hot-water pressure washer allows you to more thoroughly disinfect surfaces, which is key in food service applications and a range of other jobs as well. Steam is also highly effective at lifting dirt and grease from surfaces, and can even provide cost savings by reducing the need for some chemical or disinfectant treatments.
Vital Oxide and Food Safety
Another new game changer in cleaning is Vital Oxide. Last year, new rules that went into effect as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act, specifically the Sanitary Transportation Rule that outlined a number of regulations for cleaning, sanitizing and maintaining the cleanliness of any vehicles used to carry food products. Vital Oxide has been an ideal solution, thanks in part to its hospital-grade sanitation capabilities. Using the cleaner quickly kills 99.999 percent of bacteria, including potent germs and microorganisms like Escherichia Coli, Staphylococcus, Listeria Monocytogenes and others. Vital Oxide is also odorless, usable on most surfaces and can be used as a spray or foam, as well. Learn more in this demonstration video or call Hotsy Minnesota today to learn more.
Enzymes
A particularly beneficial trend in agricultural markets, enzyme cleaners have become much more available and prominent. Using an enzyme cleaner may seem counterintuitive in some uses – why would you spray bacterial cleaning solutions as part of a cleaning regimen? The answer is because enzymatic cleaners can actually work in tandem with a pressure washing routine to lift not just grime, dirt and animal waste, but also eliminate odors and harmful bacteria. Without getting too deep into the science, enzymes bind with specific molecules, like those found in odor-causing materials, working to bind and create an odorless byproduct that can be washed away. Best of all, most enzyme cleaners can be sprayed on with a pressure washer, then rinsed away with the same washer, allowing you to use your existing Hotsy equipment for the most thorough clean.
Water Regulation and Recovery
With greater efficiency and a focus on greener technologies and approaches at the front of many businesses’ agendas, many advancements have been made in not only water regulation, but also wastewater treatment and recovery. Modern systems are optimized to create closed circuit systems, particularly in wash bays and other enclosed spaces, and allow for the filtration of dirty water or backwash, purification using oil-water separation methods or ozone treatment, and recirculation to reduce the overall use of water supplies. This helps businesses to be not only more efficient and environmentally conscious, but also compliant with requirements set forth by local, state and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency regarding water use and wastewater disposal. <<Optional: Hotsy Minnesota has Water Maze – can include teaser here for them/other brands>>
Cleaning on Every Job

At Hotsy Minnesota, we’re experts in clean and whether its tried-and-true Hotsy pressure washers, maintenance on your existing equipment, or new detergents you need, or want to learn about the latest technologies and innovations, we’ve got you covered.

Agriculture in a 1.5 °C world
Half a degree may not sound that much but it can be a matter of life or death in the context of climate change. This is one of the headline messages of the recent IPCC special report, “Global warming of 1.5 °C”, which is based on the assessment of the latest scientific literature. The report confirms the urgency to act in order to avoid often irreversible consequences for human well-being, ecosystems and sustainable development. But what does this mean for agriculture in general and for the EU farming sector in particular? What kind of challenges would the sector face in a 1.5 °C or 2 °C world? And how can the farming sector contribute to keeping global temperature increase below 1.5°C?

Agriculture has a unique role to play in the EU’s efforts on climate
A greater shift towards climate-smart agricultural land management is increasingly urgent if the EU is to reach the emissions reductions target set out in response to the Paris Agreement. To do so requires more emphasis on climate within the Common Agricultural Policy and action to reduce the climate footprint of consumer consumption patterns.

Helped me get clean after 15 years
for 15 years I was addicted to drugs and did almost everything under the sun. Bridge was there to help me and saved my life in the end. Without their treatment I would probably be dead or in jail, but because of them I have a life I can be proud of again.

When pain killers go too far
After back surgery in 2009, I found myself in constant pain, and got hooked on pain killers because of it, even for years after my back pain went away. I was ashamed of my life, and was facing depression as well. Bridge Was there to help me get back on my feet, and with the help of my wife, finally get my life back. Thank you.

Illinois Bridge Treatment Centers » Waukegan
Our facilities in the Waukegan area have openings now, and are ready to get you or your loved one on the road to recovery.
Does the idea of handling everyday life without drugs or alcohol feel less and unwarranted like an advancement, even if you’ve seen it hurt elements of your life?
Does your usage of alcohol or drugs no longer supply you with a feeling of independence, but instead a sense that customs are consuming you away from what life could offer and now limits your happiness?
Bridge Substance Rehab Centers in Illinois are the highest rated and can discuss all the treatment options for you or a loved one to best match you where you’re in life.
Many individuals turn to alcohol or drugs as an escape from life to quit worrying about their lives and forget unwanted feelings and issues, and we can empower you to control your feelings and deal with difficulties in a safe and nurturing manner.
Occasionally it makes us uncertain about how we are going to withstand day-to-day challenges when resentment sets in based on our assessment of our childhood or the hand that life has dealt us. Except when we do that, that, impulses, problems and the feelings do not go away.
Feelings of anger and uncontrollable fury can replace the warm and fuzzy feeling so we build a reliance on these matters that appear to make everything better and that drugs or alcohol brought.
Left untreated, many people find themselves feeling out of control, even should they appear to be operating in life or abruptly wondering how they got here after experiencing a number of failures.
Averting common worries can direct you away from making good decisions in life, but with our help we can help you move beyond short term seconds that seem overwhelming toward long term success. Our support staff prides itself for providing safe and nurturing treatment.
Disconnecting from the realities of life for the moments when you use drugs and alcohol is a choice and you can safely alter your lifestyle to once again determine you deserve it.
Dealing with our truths could be heartbreaking at times particularly if we sense that we can’t escape dysfunctional patterns of behavior and start to withdraw from disregard obligations or loved ones. Instead of pursuing our interests, we get bogged down with everything in life. Because we have spent more time turning away from the realities of life, unexpectedly, we can not even carve out any time to do anything.
For many addicts who come to our Illinois treatment centers, finally feeling independence and gaining coping skills to adopt the truths in life in a secure environment activates a rewarding feeling. They feel motivated again and start to look around at life and embrace problem solving.
Despite ingrained cravings for a quick fix, they start to feel free to enjoy the simple things in life and value the opportunity to play an effective role in their own life as well as their recovery.
Nobody needs to face beating addiction alone, because treatment in a secure nurturing environment is accessible and our Waukegan centre believes that facing this on your own can be unsafe, ineffective and frustrating, especially since you deserve the support and to get from our experience.

The Ole Miss riot of 1962, or Battle of Oxford, was fought between Southern segregationist civilians and federal and state forces beginning the night of September 30, 1962; segregationists were protesting the enrollment of James Meredith, a black US military veteran, at the University of Mississippi (known affectionately as Ole Miss) at Oxford, Mississippi. Two civilians were killed during the night, including a French journalist, and over 300 people were injured,[1] including one third of the US Marshals deployed.

Background
In 1954 the US Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Meredith applied as a legitimate student with strong experience as an Air Force veteran and good grades in completed coursework at Jackson State University. Despite this, his entrance was barred first by university officials, and later by segregationist Governor Ross Barnett.
In late September, 1962, the administration of President John F. Kennedy had extensive discussions with Governor Barnett and his staff about protecting Meredith, but Barnett publicly vowed to keep the university segregated. The President and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy wanted to avoid bringing in federal forces for several reasons. Robert Kennedy hoped that legal means, along with the escort of U.S. Marshals, would be enough to force the Governor to comply.[2] He also was very concerned there might be a "mini-civil war" between the U.S. Army troops and armed protesters.[2]
Governor Barnett, under pressure from the courts, conducted secret back door discussions in response to calls from the Kennedy administration between Thursday September 27 and Sunday the 30th.[3] He was committed to maintain civil order and reluctantly agreed to allow Meredith to register in exchange for a scripted face-saving event. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered 500 U.S. Marshals to accompany Meredith during his arrival and registration.
Events
In accordance with Barnett and Kennedy's plan, on Sunday evening, September 30, the day before the anticipated showdown, Meredith was flown to Oxford. He was quietly escorted by Mississippi Highway Patrol as he moved into a dorm room. The federal marshals assembled on to campus, supported by the 70th Army Engineer Combat Battalion from Ft Campbell, Kentucky. Responding to the federal presence, a crowd of a thousand, mostly students quickly crowded onto campus. As the scene grew more out of control, at first the highway patrol helped hold off the crowds, but, despite Barnett's renewed commitment, they were withdrawn by State Senator George Yarbrough starting at about 7:25 pm local time.[4][5] The students, increasingly joined by other agitators, started to break out into a full riot on the Oxford campus.
The crowd eventually swelled to about three thousand. As its behavior turned increasingly violent, including the death of a journalist, the marshals ran out of tear gas defending the officials in the Lyceum. President Kennedy reluctantly decided to call in reinforcements in the middle of the night under the command of Brigadier General Charles Billingslea. He ordered in U.S. Army military police from the 503rd and 716th Military Police Battalions, which had previously been readied for deployment under cover of the nuclear war Exercise Spade Fork, plus the U.S. Border Patrol and the federalized Mississippi National Guard. U.S. Navy medical personnel (physicians and hospital corpsmen) attached to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Millington, Tennessee, were also sent to the university.
Before they arrived, rioters roaming the campus discovered Meredith was in Baxter Hall and started to assault it. Early in the morning, as Gen. Billingslea's party entered the university gate, a white mob attacked his staff car and set it on fire. Billingslea, the Deputy Commanding General John Corley, and aide, Capt Harold Lyon, were trapped inside the burning car, but they forced the door open, then crawled 200 yards under gunfire from the mob to the University Lyceum Building. The army did not return this fire. To keep control, Gen Billingslea had established a series of escalating secret code words for issuing ammunition down to the platoons, a second one for issuing it to squads, and a third one for loading, none of which could take place without the General confirming the secret codes.
By the end, one third of the US Marshals, a total of 166 men, were injured in the melee, and 40 soldiers and National Guardsmen were wounded.[6]
US Army trucks loaded with steel-helmeted US Marshals roll across the University of Mississippi campus on October 3, 1962.
Two men were murdered during the first night of the riots: French journalist Paul Guihard,[7] on assignment for the London Daily Sketch, who was found behind the Lyceum building with a gunshot wound to the back; and 23-year-old Ray Gunter, a white jukebox repairman who had visited the campus out of curiosity. Gunter was found with a bullet wound in his forehead. Law enforcement officials described these as execution-style killings.[8]
Finally, on October 1, 1962, Meredith became the first African-American student to be enrolled at the University of Mississippi,[9] and attended his first class, in American History.[1] Meredith graduated from the university on August 18, 1963 with a degree in political science.[10] At that time, there were still hundreds of troops guarding him 24 hours a day.[11]
Governor Barnett was fined $10,000 and sentenced to jail for contempt. The charges were later dismissed by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Representation in other media
Sports journalist Wright Thompson wrote an article "Ghosts of Mississippi" (2010),[12] that described the riot and the football team's season that year. It was adapted as a documentary film for the ESPN 30 for 30 series, entitled The Ghosts of Ole Miss (2012), about the 1962 football team's perfect season and the early violence in the fall over integration of the historic university.[13]
Legacy
The event is regarded as a pivotal moment in the history of civil rights in the United States. Bob Dylan wrote and sang about the events in his song "Oxford Town". Charles W. Eagle described Meredith's achievement by the following:
"In a major victory against white supremacy, he had inflicted a devastating blow to white massive resistance to the civil rights movement and had goaded the national government into using its overpowering force in support of the black freedom struggle."[14]
Because of the civil rights significance of Meredith's admission, the Lyceum-The Circle Historic District where the riot took place has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and state historic district.
A statue of Meredith has been erected on the campus to commemorate his historic role.
The university conducted a series of programs for a year beginning in 2002 to mark the 40th anniversary of its integration. In 2012, it initiated a yearlong series of programs to mark its 50th anniversary of integration.

Reaganomics (/reɪɡəˈnɒmɪks/; a portmanteau of [Ronald] Reagan and economics attributed to Paul Harvey)[1] refers to the economic policies promoted by U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s. These policies are commonly associated with supply-side economics, referred to as trickle-down economics or voodoo economics by political opponents, and free-market economics by political advocates.
The four pillars of Reagan's economic policy were to reduce the growth of government spending, reduce the federal income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation, and tighten the money supply in order to reduce inflation.[2]
The results of Reaganomics are still debated. Supporters point to the end of stagflation, stronger GDP growth, and an entrepreneur revolution in the decades that followed.[3][4] Critics point to the widening income gap, an atmosphere of greed, and the national debt tripling in eight years which ultimately reversed the post-World War II trend of a shrinking national debt as percentage of GDP.[5][6]

Historical context
File:Inflation and oil price 1969-1989 color corrected.png
Inflation and crude oil price, 1969-1989 (pre-Reagan years highlighted in yellow)
Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy experienced a decade of high unemployment and persistently high inflation (known as stagflation). Attacks on Keynesian economic orthodoxy as well as empirical economic models such as the Phillips Curve grew. Political pressure favored stimulus resulting in an expansion of the money supply. President Richard Nixon's wage and price controls were phased out.[7] The federal oil reserves were created to ease any future short term shocks. President Jimmy Carter had begun phasing out price controls on petroleum while he created the Department of Energy. Much of the credit for the resolution of the stagflation is given to two causes: a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under Paul Volcker, initiated in the last year of Carter's presidency, and long-term easing of supply and pricing in oil during the 1980s oil glut.[citation needed]
In stating that his intention was to lower taxes, Reagan's approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates as well as simplified income tax codes and continued deregulation. During Reagan's eight year presidency, the annual deficits averaged 4.0% of GDP, compared to a 2.2% average during the preceding eight years.[8] The real (inflation adjusted) average rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan.[9][10] GDP per employed person increased at an average 1.5% rate during the Reagan administration, compared to an average 0.6% during the preceding eight years.[11] Private sector productivity growth, measured as real output per hour of all persons, increased at an average rate of 1.9% during Reagan's eight years, compared to an average 1.3% during the preceding eight years.[12] Federal net outlays as a percent of GDP averaged 21.4% under Reagan, compared to 19.1% during the preceding eight years.[13]
During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, before Reagan's election, a combined supply and demand side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the Republican Party. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, George H. W. Bush had derided Reaganomics as "voodoo economics".[14] Similarly, in 1976, Gerald Ford had severely criticized Reagan's proposal to turn back a large part of the Federal budget to the states.

In his 1980 campaign speeches, Reagan presented his economic proposals as a return to the free enterprise principles, free market economy that had been in favor before the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal policies. At the same time he attracted a following from the supply-side economics movement, which formed in opposition to Keynesian demand-stimulus economics. This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan's policies during his term in office.
The contention of the proponents, that the tax rate cuts would more than cover any increases in federal debt, was influenced by a theoretical taxation model based on the elasticity of tax rates, known as the Laffer curve. Arthur Laffer's model predicts that excessive tax rates actually reduce potential tax revenues, by lowering the incentive to produce; the model also predicts that insufficient tax rates (rates below the optimum level for a given economy) lead directly to a reduction in tax revenues.
Policies
Reagan lifted remaining domestic petroleum price and allocation controls on January 28, 1981,[15] and lowered the oil windfall profits tax in August 1981. He ended the oil windfall profits tax in 1988.[16] During the first year of Reagan's presidency, federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,[17] which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. This act slashed estate taxes and trimmed taxes paid by business corporations by $150 billion over a five-year period. In 1982 Reagan agreed to a rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts. The 1982 tax increase undid a third of the initial tax cut. In 1983 Reagan instituted a payroll tax increase on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.[18] In 1984 another bill was introduced that closed tax loopholes. According to tax historian Joseph Thorndike, the bills of 1982 and 1984 "constituted the biggest tax increase ever enacted during peacetime".[19]
With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress sought to simplify the tax system by eliminating many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and reducing the number of tax brackets.[20][21][22][23] In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the decrease in deductions and decrease in rates raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.[24]
President Ronald Reagan signs the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 at his California ranch.
Federal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP.[25] Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20% – its lowest level since the Hoover administration.[26] The 1986 act set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%.[27]
Reagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from $267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to $393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973.[28] In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%.[29] The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987[30] and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget.[31] The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. This was the slowest rate of growth in inflation adjusted spending since Eisenhower. However, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration.[9][31][32] As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion.[33] This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation.[5] Reagan described the new debt as the "greatest disappointment" of his presidency.[34]
According to William A. Niskanen, one of the architects of Reaganomics, "Reagan delivered on each of his four major policy objectives, although not to the extent that he and his supporters had hoped", and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a "major reversal in the tax treatment of business income", with effect of "reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment". Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress.[2][35] President Reagan raised taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, but the overall tax burden went down during his presidency.[36][37] According to Paul Krugman, "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase."[18] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Though since the Reagan tax reductions, top marginal tax rates have remained lower than at any point in US history since 1931, when the top marginal rate was raised from 25% to 63%.[38]

Annual percent change in real gross domestic product — 1972 through 1988 (Reagan years in red)
Spending during the years Reagan budgeted (FY 1982–89) averaged 21.6% GDP, roughly tied with President Obama for the highest among any recent President. Each faced a severe recession early in their administration. In addition, the public debt rose from 26% GDP in 1980 to 41% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2.052 trillion in 1988, a roughly three-fold increase.[25]:143 The unemployment rate rose from 7% in 1980 to 11% in 1982, then declined to 5% in 1988. The inflation rate declined from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 1988.[2]
Some economists have stated that Reagan's policies were an important part of bringing about the third longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.[39][40] During the Reagan administration, real GDP growth averaged 3.5%, compared to 2.9% during the preceding eight years.[41] The annual average unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points, from 7.2% in 1980 to 5.5% in 1988, after it had increased by 1.6 percentage points over the preceding eight years.[42][43] Nonfarm employment increased by 16.1 million during Reagan's presidency, compared to 15.4 million during the preceding eight years,[44] while manufacturing employment declined by 582,000 after rising 363,000 during the preceding eight years.[45] Reagan's administration is the only one not to have raised the minimum wage.[46] The inflation rate, 13.5% in 1980, fell to 4.1% in 1988, due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates (prime rate peaking at 20.5% in August 1981[47]).[48] The latter contributed to a recession from July 1981 to November 1982 during which unemployment rose to 9.7% and GDP fell by 1.9%. Additionally, income growth slowed for middle- and lower-class (2.4% to 1.8%) and rose for the upper-class (2.2% to 4.83%).[49]
The misery index, defined as the inflation rate added to the unemployment rate, shrank from 19.33 when he began his administration to 9.72 when he left, the greatest improvement record for a President since Harry S. Truman left office.[50] In terms of American households, the percentage of total households making less than $10,000 a year (in real 2007 dollars) shrank from 8.8% in 1980 to 8.3% in 1988 while the percentage of households making over $75,000 went from 20.2% to 25.7% during that period, both signs of progress.[51]
Employment and wages

File:Real working class wage in 2017 dollars, 1972-1989.png
Under Reagan, real working-class wages continued the declining trend that began in 1973, albeit at a slower rate
The job growth (measured for non-farm payrolls) under the Reagan administration averaged 168,000 per month, versus 216,000 for Carter, 55,000 for H.W. Bush, and 239,000 for Clinton. Measuring the number of jobs created per month is limited for longer time periods as the population grows. To address this, we can measure annual job growth percentages, comparing the beginning and ending number of jobs during their time in office to determine an annual growth rate. Jobs grew by 2.0% annually under Reagan, versus 3.1% under Carter, 0.6% under H.W. Bush, and 2.4% under Clinton.[52]
The unemployment rate averaged 7.5% under Reagan, compared to an average 6.6% during the preceding eight years. Declining steadily after December 1982, the rate was 5.4% the month Reagan left office.[53]
The average real hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory workers continued the decline that had begun in 1973, albeit at a slower rate, and remained below the pre-Reagan level in every Reagan year.[54]
The labor force participation rate increased by 2.6 percentage points during Reagan's eight years, compared to 3.9 percentage points during the preceding eight years.[55]

Following the 1981 recession, the unemployment rate had averaged slightly higher (6.75% vs. 6.35%), productivity growth lower (1.38% vs. 1.92%), and private investment as a percentage of GDP slightly less (16.08% vs. 16.86%).[citation needed] In the 1980's, industrial productivity growth in the United States matched that of its trading partners after trailing them in the 1970's. By 1990, manufacturing's share of GNP exceeded the post-World War II low hit in 1982 and matched "the level of output achieved in the 1960's when American factories hummed at a feverish clip".[56]
GDP growth
Real GDP grew over one-third during Reagan's presidency, an over $2 trillion increase. The compound annual growth rate of GDP was 3.6% during Reagan's eight years, compared to 2.7% during the preceding eight years.[57] Real GDP per capita grew 2.6% under Reagan, compared to 1.9% average growth during the preceding eight years.[58]
Income and wealth
In nominal terms, median household income grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% during the Reagan presidency, compared to 8.5% during the preceding five years (pre-1975 data are unavailable).[59] Real median family income grew by $4,492 during the Reagan period, compared to a $1,270 increase during the preceding eight years.[60] After declining from 1974 through 1980, real mean personal income rose $4,708 by 1988.[61] Nominal household net worth increased by a CAGR of 8.4%, compared to 9.3% during the preceding eight years.[62]
Poverty level

The percentage of the total population below the poverty level increased from 13.0% in 1980 to 15.2% in 1983, then declined back to 13.0% in 1988.[64] During Reagan's first term, critics noted homelessness as a visible problem in U.S. urban centers.[65] In the closing weeks of his presidency, Reagan told David Brinkley that the homeless "make it their own choice for staying out there," noting his belief that there "are shelters in virtually every city, and shelters here, and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to going into one of those shelters". He also stated that "a large proportion" of them are "mentally impaired." A result (he believed) of ACLU (and similar organizations) lawsuits against institutions.[66] His policies became widely known as "trickle-down economics", due to the significant cuts in the upper tax brackets, as that extra money for the wealthy could trickle along to low-income groups.[67]
Federal income tax and payroll tax levels
Main article: History of taxation in the United States
During the Reagan administration, fiscal year federal receipts grew from $599 billion to $991 billion (an increase of 65%) while fiscal year federal outlays grew from $678 billion to $1144 billion (an increase of 69%).[68][69] According to a 1996 report of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress, during Reagan's two terms, and through 1993, the top 10% of taxpayers paid an increased share of income taxes (not including payroll taxes) to the Federal government, while the lowest 50% of taxpayers paid a reduced share of income tax revenue.[70] Personal income tax revenues declined from 9.4% GDP in 1981 to 8.3% GDP in 1989, while payroll tax revenues increased from 6.0% GDP to 6.7% GDP during the same period.[25]
Tax receipts
Budget deficit in billions of dollars
According to a 2003 Treasury study, the tax cuts in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 resulted in a significant decline in revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts, approximately $111 billion (in 1992 dollars) on average during the first four years after implementation or nearly 3% GDP annually.[71][72] Other tax bills had neutral or, in the case of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, a (~+1% of GDP) increase in revenue as a share of GDP. It should be noted, however, that the study did not examine the longer-term impact of Reagan tax policy, including sunset clauses and "the long-run, fully-phased-in effect of the tax bills".[72] The fact that tax receipts as a percentage of GDP fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP and a commensurate increase in the deficit, as spending did not fall relative to GDP. Total federal tax receipts increased in every Reagan year except 1982, at an annual average rate of 6.2% compared to 10.8% during the preceding eight years.[73]
The effect of Reagan's 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983[74] and following years, also to counter the uses of tax shelters.[75] An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation.[76]
Debt and government expenditures
Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981, so the first fiscal year (FY) he budgeted was 1982 and the final year was 1989.
During Reagan's presidency, the federal debt held by the public nearly tripled in nominal terms, from $738 billion to $2.1 trillion.[77] This led to the U.S. moving from the world's largest international creditor to the world's largest debtor nation.[5] Reagan described the new debt as the "greatest disappointment" of his presidency.[34]
The federal deficit as percentage of GDP rose from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal year 1981 to a peak of 5.7% of GDP in 1983, then fell to 2.7% GDP in 1989.[78]
Total federal outlays averaged of 21.8% of GDP from 1981–88, versus the 1974–1980 average of 20.1% of GDP. This was the highest of any President from Carter through Obama.[79]
Total federal revenues averaged 17.7% of GDP from 1981–88, versus the 1974–80 average of 17.6% of GDP.[80]
Federal individual income tax revenues fell from 8.7% of GDP in 1980 to a trough of 7.5% of GDP in 1984, then rose to 7.8% of GDP in 1988.[81]
Business and market performance
Nominal after-tax corporate profits grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.0% during Reagan's eight years, compared to 13.0% during the preceding eight years.[82] The S&P 500 Index increased 113.3% during the 2024 trading days under Reagan, compared to 10.4% during the preceding 2024 trading days.[83] The business sector share of GDP, measured as gross private domestic investment, declined by 0.7 percentage points under Reagan, after increasing 0.7 percentage points during the preceding eight years.[84]
Size of federal government
The federal government's share of GDP increased 0.2 percentage points under Reagan, while it decreased 1.5 percentage points during the preceding eight years.[85] The number of federal civilian employees increased 4.2% during Reagan's eight years, compared to 6.5% during the preceding eight years.[86]
As a candidate, Reagan asserted he would shrink government by abolishing the Cabinet-level departments of energy and education. He abolished neither, but elevated veterans affairs from independent agency status to Cabinet-level department status.[87][88]
Income distribution
Further information: Income inequality in the United States
Continuing a trend that began in the 1970s, income inequality grew and accelerated in the 1980s. The Economist wrote in 2006: "After the 1973 oil shocks, productivity growth suddenly slowed. A few years later, at the start of the 1980s, the gap between rich and poor began to widen."[89] According to the CBO:
The top 1% of income earners' share of income before transfers and taxes rose from 9.0% in 1979 to a peak of 13.8% in 1986, before falling to 12.3% in 1989.
The top 1% share of income earners' of income after transfers and taxes rose from 7.4% in 1979 to a peak of 12.8% in 1986, before falling to 11.0% in 1989.
The bottom 90% had a lower share of the income in 1989 vs. 1979.[90]

According to a 1996 study[93] by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. The study asserted that real median family income grew by $4,000 and during the eight Reagan years and experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.[93] The Cato study was dismissive of any positive effects of tightening, and subsequent loosening, of Federal Reserve monetary policy under "inflation hawk" Paul Volcker, whom President Carter had appointed in 1979 to halt the persistent inflation of the 1970s.
Economic analyst Stephen Moore stated in the Cato analysis, "No act in the last quarter century had a more profound impact on the U.S. economy of the eighties and nineties than the Reagan tax cut of 1981." He argued that Reagan's tax cuts, combined with an emphasis on federal monetary policy, deregulation, and expansion of free trade created a sustained economic expansion, the greatest American sustained wave of prosperity ever. He also claims that the American economy grew by more than a third in size, producing a $15 trillion increase in American wealth. Consumer and investor confidence soared. Cutting federal income taxes, cutting the U.S. government spending budget, cutting useless programs, scaling down the government work force, maintaining low interest rates, and keeping a watchful inflation hedge on the monetary supply was Ronald Reagan's formula for a successful economic turnaround.[93]
Milton Friedman stated, "Reaganomics had four simple principles: Lower marginal tax rates, less regulation, restrained government spending, noninflationary monetary policy. Though Reagan did not achieve all of his goals, he made good progress."[94]
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and its impact on the alternative minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals.[94][95][96][97] The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system.[98] In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code.[99] Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.[98][100]
Economist Paul Krugman argued the economic expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily the result of the business cycle and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker.[101] Krugman argues that there was nothing unusual about the economy under Reagan because unemployment was reducing from a high peak and that it is consistent with Keynesian economics for the economy to grow as employment increases if inflation remains low.[102]
The CBO Historical Tables indicate that federal spending during Reagan's two terms (FY 1981–88) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26.1% GDP in 1980 to 41.0% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2,052 billion in 1988, a three-fold increase.[25] Krugman argued in June 2012 that Reagan's policies were consistent with Keynesian stimulus theories, pointing to the significant increase in per-capita spending under Reagan.[103]
William Niskanen noted that during the Reagan years, privately held federal debt increased from 22% to 38% of GDP, despite a long peacetime expansion. Second, the savings and loan problem led to an additional debt of about $125 billion. Third, greater enforcement of U.S. trade laws increased the share of U.S. imports subjected to trade restrictions from 12% in 1980 to 23% in 1988.[2]
Economists Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales pointed out that many deregulation efforts had either taken place or had begun before Reagan (note the deregulation of airlines and trucking under Carter, and the beginning of deregulatory reform in railroads, telephones, natural gas, and banking). They stated, "The move toward markets preceded the leader [Reagan] who is seen as one of their saviors."[104] Economists Paul Joskow and Roger Noll made a similar contention.[105]
Economist William A. Niskanen, a member of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers wrote that deregulation had the "lowest priority" of the items on the Reagan agenda[2] given that Reagan "failed to sustain the momentum for deregulation initiated in the 1970s" and that he "added more trade barriers than any administration since Hoover." By contrast, economist Milton Friedman has pointed to the number of pages added to the Federal Register each year as evidence of Reagan's anti-regulation presidency (the Register records the rules and regulations that federal agencies issue per year). The number of pages added to the Register each year declined sharply at the start of the Ronald Reagan presidency breaking a steady and sharp increase since 1960. The increase in the number of pages added per year resumed an upward, though less steep, trend after Reagan left office. In contrast, the number of pages being added each year increased under Ford, Carter, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama.[106] The number of pages in Federal Register is however criticized as an extremely crude measure of regulatory activity, because it can be easily manipulated (e.g. font sizes have been changed to keep page count low).[107] The apparent contradiction between Niskanen's statements and Friedman's data may be resolved by seeing Niskanen as referring to statutory deregulation (laws passed by Congress) and Friedman to administrative deregulation (rules and regulations implemented by federal agencies). A 2016 study by the Congressional Research Service found that Reagan's average annual number of final federal regulatory rules published in the Federal Register was higher than during the Clinton, George W. Bush or Obama's administrations, even though the Reagan economy was considerably smaller than during those later presidents.[108] Another study by the QuantGov project of the libertarian Mercatus Center found that the Reagan administration added restrictive regulations — containing such terms as "shall," "prohibited" or "may not" — at a faster average annual rate than did Clinton, Bush or Obama.[109]
Greg Mankiw, a conservative Republican economist who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush, wrote in 2007:
I used the phrase "charlatans and cranks" in the first edition of my principles textbook to describe some of the economic advisers to Ronald Reagan, who told him that broad-based income tax cuts would have such large supply-side effects that the tax cuts would raise tax revenue. I did not find such a claim credible, based on the available evidence. I never have, and I still don't ... My other work has remained consistent with this view. In a paper on dynamic scoring, written while I was working at the White House, Matthew Weinzierl and I estimated that a broad-based income tax cut (applying to both capital and labor income) would recoup only about a quarter of the lost revenue through supply-side growth effects. For a cut in capital income taxes, the feedback is larger — about 50 percent — but still well under 100 percent. A chapter on dynamic scoring in the 2004 Economic Report of the President says about the the [sic] same thing.[110]
Glenn Hubbard, who preceded Mankiw as Bush's CEA chair, also disputed the assertion that tax cuts increase tax revenues, writing in his 2003 Economic Report of the President: "Although the economy grows in response to tax reductions (because of higher consumption in the short run and improved incentives in the long run), it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity."[111]
In 1986, Martin Feldstein — a self-described "traditional supply sider" who served as Reagan's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors from 1982 to 1984 — characterized the "new supply siders" who emerged circa 1980:
What distinguished the new supply siders from the traditional supply siders as the 1980s began was not the policies they advocated but the claims that they made for those policies ... The "new" supply siders were much more extravagant in their claims. They projected rapid growth, dramatic increases in tax revenue, a sharp rise in saving, and a relatively painless reduction in inflation. The height of supply side hyperbole was the "Laffer curve" proposition that the tax cut would actually increase tax revenue because it would unleash an enormously depressed supply of effort. Another remarkable proposition was the claim that even if the tax cuts did lead to an increased budget deficit, that would not reduce the funds available for investment in plant and equipment because tax changes would raise the saving rate by enough to finance the increased deficit ... Nevertheless, I have no doubt that the loose talk of the supply side extremists gave fundamentally good policies a bad name and led to quantitative mistakes that not only contributed to subsequent budget deficits but that also made it more difficult to modify policy when those deficits became apparent.[112]

By the end of 1982 the recession in U.S. economy was deeply depressed, with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression. So there was plenty of room to grow before the economy returned to anything like full employment.)

Abstract
The present paper was suggested by the occurrence on the coast of New South Wales of a specimen of Schedophilus maculatus, this being the first record for the genus from Australian waters, and the time has been deemed opportune to review the history, such as it is, of the various species, the more especially that these pelagic forms are liable to occur at any time upon any part of the Australian coast, and, where so little is known of them, it is advisable that no opportunity should be lost of recording any fresh facts in connection with their distribution and mode of life.
The genus Schedophilus was originally placed by Günther among the Coryphaenina, at that time considered to be a Group of the Scombridae, but subsequently accorded family rank.

How to Find Out If Someone Has a Green Card
By Carol Adams - Updated April 08, 2017
Migrant workers have become an important part of the U.S. work force, but with this influx has come a large number of illegal aliens who attempt to get work under false pretenses. All too often, people who seem to have a valid green card in fact do not. There are ID mills across the country that churn out thousand of fake green cards. If you want to determine if the person in question has handed you a real green card or a fake, there are several features you can look at. Keep in mind that green cards are not actually green.
How to Spot a Fake Green Card
Look closely at the photo on the card. The government uses a camera that takes the photo at a slight angle, meaning that you should clearly see the right eye and the individual should not be looking directly at the camera. Run a finger over the photo. It it seems to have a raised surface, it's a fake. Check the text in the card, looking for misspellings or missing or misplaced words. Also examine the quality of the text, such as smears or the spacing between the letters being uneven. Compare the date on the front of the card to the one on the back to make sure they match. Look at the hologram. It should have the logo of the Department of Homeland Security.

What’s The Deal With L-theanine, Taylor Swift’s Anxiety Remedy Of Choice?
Health
March 7, 2019 LogHim.com0
Do you stay up too late? Have nothing in your brain? Taylor Swift has her own solution for that when it’s stress-related.
Ahead of her 30th birthday in December, Swift shared with Elle 30 lessons she has already learned about life. Included on the list? The importance of vitamins.
“Vitamins make me feel so much better!” she wrote. “I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.”
Swift’s giant platform likely includes some of the 40 million adults in the United States who experience anxiety, who no doubt might be curious about whether this supplement ― an amino acid found in tea ― actually works.
Liz Weinandy, a registered dietician at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center, says it’s best to handle Swift’s advice delicately.
“It’s reportedly used for anxiety and stress, although the research doesn’t always necessarily show that,” she said. “The research shows mostly that it could be beneficial for mental performance ― attention, making less errors, things like that.”
Research published in 2014 in the PIT Journal did explore the impact a combination of caffeine and L-theanine has on testing anxiety and a person’s performance on college exams, and found that it reduced anxiety prompted by mental tasks. But, as Weinandy said, the paper concludes that more research is needed to make a definitive conclusion.
Weinandy told HuffPost she doesn’t think the supplement is dangerous in any way, but noted that it has not been tested in kids, who make up a huge portion of Swift’s fan base. As supplements are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, she also warns that you should make sure you know exactly what’s inside any vitamin or supplement you try.
That’s why she says the best way for people to try to manage stress and anxiety initially is through diet. “There’s a lot of research to show that an overall good, healthy diet helps with stress reduction and mental health overall, including a number of studies that link mostly fruit and vegetable intake to decreased depression,” she said.
She also added that there a few ways to consume L-theanine without taking a pill ― it’s found in black and green tea and even in some mushrooms.
Additionally, the placebo effect may come into play, meaning that people are told the supplement works so they automatically feel like their stress or anxiety is lower, even if it isn’t. But Weinandy said that’s hard to measure because everyone metabolizes things so differently.
“I think it definitely might help [Swift],” she said, adding, “I just don’t think it’s as effective as things like getting enough sleep, exercise and a healthy diet. Those are going to likely have much more of an impact than a single amino acid.”
Still, if Swift is going to be promoting something, this is low on the risk list. “I can think of much worse,” Weinandy said.
So, not an End Game for stress, per se. But it doesn’t necessarily hurt either.

Why Manufacturing Will Return to the U.S.
By:Harold L. Sirkin, Michael Zinser, and Douglas Hohner
For more than a decade, deciding where to build a manufacturing plant to supply the world was simple for many companies. With its seemingly limitless supply of low-cost labor and an enormous, rapidly developing domestic market, an artificially low currency, and significant government incentives to attract foreign investment, China was the clear choice.
Now, however, a combination of economic forces is fast eroding China’s cost advantage as an export platform for the North American market. Meanwhile, the U.S., with an increasingly flexible workforce and a resilient corporate sector, is becoming more attractive as a place to manufacture many goods consumed on this continent. An analysis by The Boston Consulting Group concludes that, by sometime around 2015—for many goods destined for North American consumers—manufacturing in some parts of the U.S. will be just as economical as manufacturing in China. The key reasons for this shift include the following:
Wage and benefit increases of 15 to 20 percent per year at the average Chinese factory will slash China’s labor-cost advantage over low-cost states in the U.S., from 55 percent today to 39 percent in 2015, when adjusted for the higher productivity of U.S. workers. Because labor accounts for a small portion of a product’s manufacturing costs, the savings gained from outsourcing to China will drop to single digits for many products.
For many goods, when transportation, duties, supply chain risks, industrial real estate, and other costs are fully accounted for, the cost savings of manufacturing in China rather than in some U.S. states will become minimal within the next five years.
Automation and other measures to improve productivity in China won’t be enough to preserve the country’s cost advantage. Indeed, they will undercut the primary attraction of outsourcing to China—access to low-cost labor.
Given rising income levels in China and the rest of developing Asia, demand for goods in the region will increase rapidly. Multinational companies are likely to devote more of their capacity in China to serving the domestic Chinese as well as the larger Asian market, and to bring some production work for the North American market back to the U.S.
Manufacturing of some goods will shift from China to nations with lower labor costs, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico. But these nations’ ability to absorb the higher-end manufacturing that would otherwise go to China will be limited by inadequate infrastructure, skilled workers, scale, and domestic supply networks, as well as by political and intellectual-property risks. Low worker productivity, corruption, and the risk to personal safety are added concerns in some countries.
This reallocation of global manufacturing is in its very early phases. It will vary dramatically from industry to industry, depending on labor content, transportation costs, China’s competitive strengths, and the strategic needs of individual companies. But we believe that it will become more pronounced over the next five years, especially as companies face decisions about where to add future capacity. While China will remain an important manufacturing platform for Asia and Europe, the U.S. will become increasingly attractive for the production of many goods sold to consumers in North America.
This report, the first in a series, examines the economic trends that point to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance. It also explores the strategic implications of the shifting cost equation for companies engaged in global sourcing.

US Department of Energy: Electrical Engineering Efficiency Standards for Appliances and Equipment
Energy and electrical engineering in all its forms are complex technical topics, and for the general public it can be hard to tell which products are energy efficient. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has been creating and enforcing standards since 1979 to ensure that appliances and equipment provide value for customers. This has been one of the most effective energy efficiency policies ever implemented by the US, yielding billions of dollars in energy savings each year.
As of 2017, the US Department of Energy publishes standards for more than 60 product categories, which account for more than 90% of residential energy consumption, 60% of commercial energy consumption, and 30% of industrial energy consumption. In addition, the DOE updates its procedures every seven years to keep up with the pace of technological development. These testing procedures are also used by the ENERGY STAR program, which showcases the most efficient products in the market, and is a joint effort by the US Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The main differences between both programs are the following:
The Appliance and Equipment Standards Program is mandatory and enforced by federal laws. If a product is part of a regulated category and is found to be non-compliant, it cannot be sold legally in the US.
The ENERGY STAR program is more demanding in its performance requirements, but voluntary. However, labeling is required by some rebate programs for energy-efficient equipment. The program has a category called ENERGY STAR Most Efficient, which lists the top-performing equipment year by year.
Achievements of the DOE Standards Program
Thanks to the DOE Appliances and Equipment Standards Program, energy consumers are expected to achieve cumulative savings of $1 trillion by 2020, and $2 trillion by 2030. In 2015 alone, US homes and businesses saved approximately $63 billion in energy expenses thanks to the program.
In the absence of DOE standards, the average US household would spend $321 more on energy each year. In addition, since testing procedures and standards are under constant improvement, annual household savings are expected to increase to $529 by 2030. The following are some of the home appliances that have achieved the largest efficiency improvements since the US DOE started regulating them:
Compared with 1973 models, modern refrigerators only consume 25% of the energy while offering 20% more storage space and having a retail price that is 50% lower.
Since 1990, energy use has been reduced by 70% for clothes washers, 40% for dishwashers, 50% for air conditioners and 10% for furnaces.
To keep up with the pace of technological development, the US DOE reviews its approved testing procedures every seven years, and standards are reviewed every six years. This helps manufacturers schedule their product launches more effectively, since the publication of reviewed standards and testing procedures follows a predictable timeframe.
How the DOE Chooses Which Products to Regulate
When deciding which appliances and equipment to cover in its standards, the DOE considers the average energy consumption of the product in question and its total energy use throughout the US. They also analyze the technological and economic implications of energy efficiency improvements, and only proceed with those that are considered feasible.
There are many occasions where a specific product category is found to have significant potential for energy efficiency improvement, but a labeling program may be enough to achieve the required performance level. In these cases, the DOE may decide that a full standard is not necessary and that a labeling program is enough.
How Manufacturers and Electrical Engineering Experts Can Manage their Certification Process
Although DOE standardization may seem like a burden for manufacturers and others involved in electrical engineering, it is actually beneficial because they can deal with a single regulating entity, rather than having to meet fragmented standards from many institutions. In fact, no agency is allowed to regulate products already covered by DOE standards, unless a waiver is granted by the DOE itself.
The US DOE developed an online tool called the Compliance Certification Management System (CCMS). Through this platform, manufacturers and authorized third-parties can create, submit and track reports completely through the Internet. The system has a Microsoft Excel template for each product category to speed up the certification process, and submissions are automatically directed to the corresponding area of the DOE’s Building Technologies Office for review.
Once a submission has been approved, it is published through another online tool called the Compliance Certification Database, where certification reports and compliance statements can be browsed and filtered by product category. The US DOE updates the database every two weeks, adding any new products that were reviewed and certified after the last update. This database ensures that all key certification information is readily available for manufacturers, as well as their business partners and clients.
The eeCompass Platform For Customers
Even with certified products, a customer may not get the best performance if the equipment selected is not a suitable match for the intended application. Therefore, the DOE has created the eeCompass website to help customers make informed decisions regarding their energy-consuming appliances.
The eeCompass platform covers more than 2 million products and allows users to search and compare them by model number, manufacturer or key performance metrics.
The US Department of Energy holds meetings where the general public is invited to comment on proposed changes to testing procedures and standards. Meeting dates are published in the Building Technologies Office website, and participation can be in-person or online.
By making sure their electrical engineering professionals and other contractors only use compliant equipment, property management companies can guarantee energy efficiency in their building systems, while also making indoor spaces safer for occupants.

“Lone wolf” white male terrorists have increasingly been on the FBI’s radar
By Chauncey Alcorn | Oct. 4, 2017
Since 9/11, the United States government has spent much of its time and money combating the terrorist threat posed by foreign Islamic extremist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS.
National security experts in 2017, however, are equally concerned about the threat posed by white supremacists like suspected Charlottesville, Virginia, killer James Fields and so-called lone wolf mass shooters like Stephen Paddock.
During a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs committee hearing — just five days before the 64-year-old retired accountant carried out a mass shooting that left at least 58 people dead and injured at least 527 more in Las Vegas — Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and FBI director Christopher Wray were on Capitol Hill discussing the relative lack of national attention paid to domestic terrorist threats relative to international ones like the Islamic State.
McCaskill referenced an April report from the Government Accountability Office that showed white supremacists and other anti-government extremists have carried out 62 terrorist attacks resulting in 106 fatalities since 9/11. Radical Muslims during that time have executed just 23 domestic terror attacks in the U.S. that killed 119 people, according to the GAO report.
So far this year, white supremacists have killed at least four Americans on U.S. soil.
Islamic extremists haven’t killed any.

“I don’t think most Americans realize that the number of incidents by white supremacist militant [and] anti-government organizations are almost triple the number of attacks of those who identify with a jihadist movement internationally in this country,” McClaskill said during the hearing.
“If you ask most Americans, they would assume that the threat from ISIS influence is much greater, and in reality, the facts don’t support that,” she said.
Wray told McCaskill and the rest of the Senate that the bureau has been investigating 1,000 white supremacist and domestic terror cases over the last 11-12 months and has made 176 related arrests of domestic terror subjects over the same period of time.
“I’ve now been starting just in my first few weeks on the job getting out to some of the field offices and there are significant numbers of agents who are working very, very hard on that subject,” Wray said. “I can assure you that it’s a top, top priority for us.”
A common profile

There’s no evidence yet to suggest Paddock was a white supremacist, but the massacre he carried out is the latest in a string of high-profile mass shooting incidents committed by “lone wolf” white men in 2017.
The GAO’s April report indicated lone wolf mass shooters are a terrorist category on the FBI’s radar, in accordance with the recommendations offered in a 2011 Strategic Implementation Plan for preventing attacks by violent extremists.
“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) expanded analysis in some areas of this task, including the creation of behavioral indicator cards, which depict mobilization and disengagement, however there is no information on how the FBI expanded analysis on single-actor terrorism,” the report reads.
Some of these lone wolves are school shooters like 15-year-old Caleb Sharpe who shot four of his Freeman High School classmates, killing one, on Sept. 13.
Others are angry ex-husbands like Spencer Hight, who police say fatally shot eight people, including his 27-year-old ex-wife as she hosted a party at her home in Plano, Texas.
There are also disgruntled workers like John Robert Neumann Jr., who shot and killed five of his Orlando, Florida, coworkers on June 5, and 24-year-old Randy Stair, who fired 59 shots and killed three of his supermarket coworkers in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania on June 7.
Former Bernie Sanders campaign volunteer James T. Hodgkinson shot five people at a Republican charity baseball practice on in Arlington, Virginia, on June 14.
Thomas Hartless fatally shot two nursing home workers and a police chief in Kirkersville, Ohio, on May 12.
Gun Violence Archive executive director Mark Bryant says alleged killers like these men fit a common demographic profile for white mass shooters that is less scrutinized by lawmakers and the national media than inner-city gang violence and Islamic extremists.
When radical Muslims commit acts of terror or black and Hispanic gang members kill each other and innocent bystanders, their crimes are often seen as evidence of some larger cultural defect among their respective minority groups.
Yet when white men commit mass murder, they’re commonly viewed as unique, disturbed individuals rather than cautionary indicators of some larger behavioral issues within their demographic, according to Bryant.
“If Stephen Paddock would have been Islamic, everybody would have screamed ‘terrorist,’” Bryant said. “But because he was a white guy, nobody screams ‘terrorist.’”
Before 9/11 changed how Americans view terrorism, men like Timothy McVeigh and “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski were viewed as prototypical U.S. mass murderers, radicalized by white nationalist and anti-government ideology.
Those men used explosives to commit their crimes, which shows completely eliminating mass murder threats may be impossible, according to Bryant.
The motive for Paddock’s alleged crime is still unknown. He had no criminal record, no apparent strong political views, no known history of mental illness, and was viewed as a “normal, good guy” by his neighbors.
But Bryant says if more Americans saw men like Paddock as potential mass murderers, they might be more likely to support gun control measures to prevent deadly weapons from getting into the wrong hands.
“I’m a 62-year-old white guy. I am the epitome of a mass shooter profile,” Bryant said. “I’m from the South. I own guns. I shoot targets... I’m that sweet spot of what [law enforcement experts] expect a mass shooter to be.”

Egypt’s twin Palm Sunday horrors marked the latest ISIS atrocities against Christians in the Middle East — and followed release of a video calling them the “favorite prey” of radical Islamists.
“O, worshippers of the cross . . . the soldiers of the state are watching you,” a masked militant identified as Abu Zubair al-Masri warned in the February propaganda video.

ISIS targets Egypt’s Christians as its ‘favorite prey’
Christians are the “favorite prey” of ISIS jihadis, according to...	
The 20-minute video — from an ISIS affiliate called the Islamic State in Egypt — features footage of Coptic Pope Tawadros II along with Christian businessmen, judges and priests.
It also shows Mahmoud Shafik Mohamed Mostafa, also known as Abu Abdullah al-Masri, identified as the suicide bomber who struck St. Mark’s Coptic Cathedral in Cairo on Dec. 11, killing 28 people, mainly women and children.
Until Sunday, that attack was the worst in Egypt since the bombing of the Saints Church in Alexandria, also Coptic, early on New Year’s Day 2011, when 21 people were slaughtered.
One of the most notorious massacres of Coptic Christians was memorialized in a gruesome February 2015 ISIS video that shows the beheadings of 21 Egyptian migrants on the shore of Libya.
Following the slayings, a masked killer known as Jihadi John points his knife toward the Mediterranean Sea, vowing: “And we will conquer Rome by Allah’s permission, the promise of our prophet, peace be upon him.”

“What Doctors do when They Feel Rotten…”
Dear friend,
I bet you have wondered this yourself. “What do doctors do…” Do they just take a ‘magic’ drug that they never told us about? Let’s face it, as a society we are ‘hooked’ on drugs, both the illegal and the legal ones. But, most people don’t know that it’s actually the legal ones that kill many times more people than the illegal ones. A gut-wrenching statistic I just read was that 1 in 4 children are taking a prescription medicine on a regular basis.
Let me tell you a little story.
17 years ago, I was in middle school at Parkway West when I started having serious feelings of depression and anxiety, terrible headaches, and all over body pain. I was scared. Talking to school counselors helped, but there was still something very wrong. I was afraid to tell my parents how I felt. Much of the time I felt alone. I explored the unfortunate route of prescription drugs. One would make me feel loopy or the next would make me feel wiped out but they kept me alive. The pain and symptoms got worse in high school. I honestly thought that everyone lived with pain and so I just accepted the problems.
Then, 6 years ago a friend introduced me to a man that changed my life forever, an Upper Cervical Chiropractor. That didn’t mean much to me at first but I knew he was different. He didn’t pop, bend or crack my neck. He gently and painlessly moved a bone in my upper neck. That week, my headaches were less severe and then gone. Soon after, most of the body pain that had plagued me for years disappeared. Then, there was the biggest change that I never expected. A few months into care I started feeling happier, less anxious, and more positive. The veil of depression and anxiety that had ruled my life for 11 years was lifted. I felt like a new person. Because of the great results, I decided to become an upper cervical chiropractor so I could help others.
The ‘quick fix’ mentality of ‘just take a pill’ (not a true fix at all) is still common, but the good news is that things are changing. People are getting smarter. I recently read in USA Today that the pharmaceutical industry is now rethinking their strategy, because the medical profession and prescription drugs usually only deal with symptoms, and not the cause of sick-ness. Chiropractors have dealt with a cause for 116 years, and have never wavered. And guess what! Now there are more visits to ‘alternative’ health care providers than ‘traditional’ ones.
6 years ago chiropractic saved me from pain and depression, and now I do my best to help others with the same problem, as well as headaches, migraines, chronic pain, neck pain, shoulder/arm pain, whiplash, backaches, ear infections, asthma, bedwetting, IBS, insomnia, allergies, numbness in limbs, ADD/ADHD, and arthritis just to name a few.
Oh, about the photo. That’s me on the left with my husband, Jason and my twin girls Addie and Lexi at my sisters wedding. I’ve had the twins adjusted since birth and they are very healthy kids. Obviously, they aren’t perfect but are a lot of fun. Keeping them well adjusted is going to keep them from having the health problems I went through as a child.
So, what is it that I and doctors that I know do when they feel rotten? We get checked to see if we need a chiropractic adjustment. When my body is balanced, it responds by healing itself, and the results are wonderful. It’s as simple as that!
Here’s what some of my patients had to say:
“When I came in I was limping from a broken hip and my legs were different lengths. Since getting adjusted, I can walk almost perfectly and I feel generally better. I am so thankful for Dr. Bagley.” – (Marilyn Davis- Ballwin)
“The gentle adjustment that Dr. B uses has made my neck and back pain go away and stay away for the majority of the last 3 years!”- (Mariann Wedel-Webster Groves)
“I went from taking 5-6 pain pills a day to maybe 1 or 2 a week in a very short time. This care has changed my life.” (Angela P- Brentwood)
You should know that I don’t heal anyone of anything. What I do is perform a specific upper cervical adjustment to remove nerve interference, and the body responds by healing itself. We get tremendous results.
Forty-eight million Americans no longer have health insurance, and those who do have found that their benefits are reduced. That’s where chiropractic comes in. Many people find that they actually save money on their health care expenses by seeing a chiropractor. Another way to save…published, peer-reviewed research indicates that the immune system may be enhanced by chiropractic adjustments. The immune system is the system that helps the body fight colds, the flu, and many other sicknesses. Although all people respond differently to care, maybe you won’t be running off to the medical doctor as much once you start chiropractic. This is especially important if you are self-employed.
You Benefit from an Amazing Offer. It shouldn’t cost you an arm and a leg to correct your health. Look, you are going to write a check to someone for your health care. Why not write one for a lesser a-mount for chiropractic? When you bring in this article, you will receive my new patient exam for just $27. That’s with x-rays, paraspinal thermal imaging….the whole ball of wax. But, please call right away because this offer expires on Friday, February 18th 2011 and I don’t want you to miss out (this special deal, by law, cannot be used for Medicare and Medicaid patients but we would still love to meet you). By the way, further care is very affordable and you’ll be happy to know that I have family care plans, senior discounts, and student discounts. You see I’m not trying to seduce you to come see me with this low start up fee, then to only make it up with high fees after that. Further care is very important to consider when making your choice of doctor.
Great care at a great fee…Please, I hope that there’s no misunderstanding about quality of care just because I have a lower exam fee. You’ll get great care at a great fee. My qualifications: I’m a graduate of SLU and Logan. I am board certified and licensed in the state of Missouri. I’ve been entrusted to take care of families from the tiny babies to the great-grandparents. I just have that low fee to help more people who need care.
My office is both friendly and warm and we try our best to make you feel at home. We have a wonderful service, at an exceptional fee. You will just love Michelle at the front desk when you call (ask her about her chiropractic experience). We are Vital Force Upper Cervical Clinic at 10028 Manchester Road (southwest corner at Sappington). Our phone number is (314) 596 – 4070. Call today for an appointment. We can help you.
Thank you.
– Beth Bagley, D.C.
P.S. When accompanied by the first, the second family member/friend will receive this same exam for only $10.

NASA analyzes newly formed Tropical Cyclone Cilidaa

An infrared look by NASA’s Aqua satellite revealed where the strongest storms were located within recently formed Tropical Cyclone Cilida. Cilida formed in the Southern Indian Ocean on Dec. 18.
On Dec. 19 at 4:35 a.m. EDT (0935 UTC) the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument aboard NASA’s Aqua satellite analyzed cloud top temperatures of Tropical Cyclone Cilida in infrared light. AIRS found cloud top temperatures of strongest thunderstorms were south of the center. Coldest temperatures were as cold as or colder than minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 degrees Celsius). Cloud top temperatures that cold indicate strong storms that have the capability to create heavy rain.
Satellite imagery shows a consolidating system with a weak and partially exposed low level circulation. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center noted that “fragmented formative rain bands are spiraling in mostly from the east.”
On Dec. 19 at 10 a.m. EST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Cyclone Cilida was located near latitude 11.6 degrees south and longitude 60.6 degrees east. That’s about 544 nautical miles north-northeast of Port Louis, Mauritius. Cilida is moving to the south-southwest. Maximum sustained winds were near 35 knots (40 mph/65 kph).
Threatened landmasses include St. Brandon, Mauritius, and Rodrigues Island as Cilida is forecast to move southwest, and later southeast as it strengthens to 95 knots (109 mph/175 kph) after 4 days. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center expects Cilida to pass to the east of Mauritius on Dec. 22.

The film and animation clubs joined together at the beginning of this year to form the cinematic arts club in Room F10.
The room provides a perfect environment for club members to work on the many different aspects of cinema. Visual arts teacher Joshua Sheridan uses the room to teach digital art and digital photography, so all the computers inside have all the tools one would need for video production.
Apart from meeting in the club every Friday, club members occasionally get together outside of class and work on small film projects. After merging and becoming a brand new club, the cinematic arts club gained a substantial amount of new members. They have many plans for the future.
Club President Marlon Fu said, “We plan on starting off small, making a couple of skits so that all the club members can get their feet wet, but eventually hope to take on more ambitious projects. We used to get together outside of school and produce film shorts on our own, and after we merged we decided to lead more group-based projects, but that is yet to happen.”
The cinematic arts club can serve as a place where students can learn about filmmaking, seeing as the film class did not have enough students this year.
“We want our members to be able to do something they like. Many people took animation classes in middle school. This club is for the people who don’t have time to take a class, so they can come to our club and do what they like here. A film class did not land this year, and we’ve been getting quite a bit of members for most of our meetings because of that,” said club Vice President Jonathan Yip.
The cinematic industry’s many components means that there are lots of areas where club members may share similar interests.
”Personally, I think film is one of the greatest arts because it combines visual art, music, and everything else like that. It’s like a good middle ground,” Fu said.
Many club members feel that the club is a good environment to share ideas and collaborate with other content creators who have a similar passion.
Freshman Caden Posse says, “I like how the club accepts all ideas and how you can work together so easily. There’s no judgment or hesitation; you just put your ideas out the table, and everyone works together to make it happen.”

This is a great article. We’d love to have more students stop by Room F10 on Fridays during lunch to learn about making their own films or learning more about animation. The club is a really welcoming place and I’d highly recommend you stop by if you have any interest!

AIRCRAFT DEICING/ANTI-ICING TIDBITS | Simanaitis Says

AIRCRAFT DEICING/ANTI-ICING TIDBITS
TEMPERATURES TODAY in a few Southern California locales may hit three digits (Fahrenheit, thankfully). So I thought some tidbits about aircraft deicing and anti-icing might be cool. Maybe you’re familiar with the black leading edges of many aircraft wings. Maybe you’ve been on a modern jet as it’s deiced prior to takeoff.
An anachronistic image from Microsoft Flight Simulator: My 1920 Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20 getting deiced with modern equipment.
The icing-up of its wings and control surfaces sent many an early aircraft to its doom. Pilots carrying the mail in biplanes learned to invoke quick little control inputs to dislodge formations of ice.
The black portions of leading edges on this Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress are rubber deicing boots.
To reduce in-flight ice accumulation, lower-speed aircraft have pneumatically actuated rubber boots on the leading edges of wings, stabilizers and rudders. Inflation/deflation causes the ice to crack and flake off. Turboprop and turbojet aircraft route their engine heat through ducts to exterior surfaces for the same purpose.
Brushes and scrappers were important in aircraft winter maintenance; here, a British European Airways ex-RAF Transport Command Dakota (DC-3), c. 1950. Image from Kilfrost Ltd.
Aircraft deicing liquids of the 1950s were typically ethylene glycol, the same chemical used in the era’s automotive antifreezes. Since the 1980s, EG has been replaced by propylene glycol, similar in its anti-freeze properties, but less toxic. PG is considered GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
An Aeroflot A330 Airbus is deiced at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport. Image from Russavia.
Today, there are two basic types of aircraft deicing/anti-icing fluids, both environmentally friendly variants of PG. Type I, orange for identification purposes, is formally a deicer providing immediate albeit temporary removal of ice and snow. This high-pressure mixture of PG and water is applied at around 95 degrees Fahrenheit from one or more cherry-picker trucks, each containing as much as 2000 gal. of the fluid. Run-off of Type I deicer appears as slush with a pink tinge earning the nickname “pink snow.”
Pink snow is forming on this aircraft being deiced at Copenhagen Airport. Image by File Upload Bot (Magnus Manske).
The other primary variety, Type IV, is an anti-icing fluid. Its unheated, undiluted PG is enhanced with a thickening agent. This anti-icing fluid is applied to retard any future accumulation of snow and sleet. For ID purposes, Type IV fluids are dyed green. Sometimes, both a deicer and then an anti-icer are applied in a two-step procedure.
Type II fluids, yellow in color, are intermediate to Types I and IV in their duration of effectiveness. Type III fluids, light yellow, are a compromise of Types I and II, intended for slower aircraft taking off at 100 knots (115 mph) or less. All of these characterizations arise from SAE International’s AMS 1424 and 1428, ISO 11074 and 11078.
Its orange color identifies this deicer as Type I fluid. Image from Aviation History.
Though toxic to mammals, EG-based deicers are still used in some parts of the world. Increasingly, those of the PG variety have evolved in their environmental friendliness. For example, one run-off hazard is a fluid’s COD, its chemical oxygen demand, a measure of its depletion of oxygen in adjacent waterways.
In 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued Effluent Limitation Guidelines. Related to this, AviationPros cited development of a hybrid compound of PG and glycerin that lowers COD by 25 percent. This product was evaluated by airlines at Chicago O’Hare in 2010 with positive results. ds

The wonderful book Fate is the Hunter, by Ernest K. Gann, has some hair-raising stories of icing in the piston prop days, with DC-2s. One of the best, if not the best, collections of aviation narratives ever written.

Hey Dennis! Great stuff as always. I hope you are doing well, and give my best to Dottie.
My RV-9A is nearly complete, and I’m looking to move into a hangar within a month or so…either Chino or Cable. I’m also getting current, in a Piper Cherokee, after a lapse of nearly seven years. The stick and rudder skills come back quickly, but my radio work is still a bit rough. Such a thrill to be in the air again.
Hope to see you soon. Maybe Brian Blades will throw another “good ol’ days” party.

Joint Nuclear Regulatory Commission/U.S. Geological Survey Workshop on Probability of Landslide-Generated Tsunamis
By Eric Geist and Uri ten Brink
July / August 2012

Nuclear accidents caused by the massive tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 were grim reminders that nuclear power plants along U.S. coastlines must be assessed for both earthquake and tsunami hazards. Most tsunamis are generated by earthquakes, submarine landslides, or a combination of both. Currently, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) evaluates earthquake hazards using probabilistic methods, that is, determining the probability that a certain level of ground motion will be met or exceeded in a given period of time. In contrast, the NRC evaluates tsunami hazards by determining the “worst-case” scenario, which is independent of time. Ongoing research is exploring whether tsunami hazards can be evaluated probabilistically at the design probabilities of interest to the NRC (typically, an annual probability of 1/10,000 or 1/100,000).
The significant obstacle in calculating tsunami severity at very low probabilities is the need to include submarine landslides as well as earthquakes in the analysis. Information on how often submarine landslides occur is uncertain or altogether lacking in some regions, resulting in high uncertainty in the probabilistic analysis of tsunami hazards in comparison with the probabilistic analysis of earthquakes.
For the past several years, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has done research to identify and date significant submarine landslides along the U.S. Atlantic margin and in the Gulf of Mexico-Caribbean region. For example, see “Submarine Landslides as Potential Triggers of Tsunamis That Could Strike the U.S. East Coast,” Sound Waves, August 2009, and “Gravity Coring Offshore Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to Investigate the Timing of Submarine Landslides and Large Earthquakes,” Sound Waves, July 2008.
Recent efforts have focused on how submarine-landslide probability might be determined using available geological and geophysical information and on identifying the challenges of incorporating this information into the determination of tsunami probabilities. To address these issues, a joint “NRC/USGS Workshop on Landslide Probability” was held August 18–19, 2011, at the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Academic, industry, and government participants provided an overview of topics including geological characterization of submarine landslides, geotechnical techniques and measurements of slope stability, hydrodynamic modeling of landslide-generated tsunamis, and probabilistic methods for hazard assessment. In attendance from the NRC were Annie Kammerer from the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research and Henry Jones from the Office of New Reactors. The goal of the workshop was to bring together experts who study the geometry, geotechnical properties, and recurrence of submarine slope failures, the potential of these failures to generate tsunamis, and the probability of recurrence of extreme events, in order to answer the following questions:
Using current data, what can we say about the probability of submarine mass failures (landslides)?
How do we treat the dynamics of landslide movement probabilistically?
How do we treat propagation (travel through the ocean) and runup (flooding to a given elevation on land) of tsunami waves probabilistically?
What new probabilistic methods can be developed specifically for submarine mass failures?
Although probability is mentioned in all of these questions, a probabilistic assessment is only as good as the underlying data and assumptions; therefore, it is critical that we address the state of knowledge and the kinds of new data that will be needed to improve our ability to estimate the probability of landslides capable of generating tsunamis.
Workshop participants summarized the state of knowledge regarding the probability of landslide-generated tsunamis, particularly along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Presentations were grouped into four sessions: (1) landslide geometry and recurrence, (2) landslide mechanics, (3) modeling landslide-generated tsunamis, and (4) probability of landslides and landslide-generated tsunamis.
The landslide geometry and recurrence session included an overview talk by USGS emeritus scientist Homa Lee on how submarine landslides are identified (including potential pitfalls) and an overview of mapped landslides in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. Atlantic margins by USGS scientist David Twichell. Details of various techniques used to date submarine landslides and sediment-transport processes associated with landslides were given by USGS scientists Jason Chaytor and Daniel Brothers, respectively.
The first three talks in the landslide mechanics session focused on geotechnical characterization of slope stability, including a technique for determining the likelihood of landslide occurrence given information on earthquake ground-shaking probabilities and bathymetric slope, presented by Uri ten Brink, USGS. Don DeGroot, University of Massachusetts Amherst, described state-of-the-art instrumentation to provide geotechnical characterization of the seafloor. An overview of geotechnical considerations for landslide occurrence was given by Jacques Locat, Université Laval, Québec, followed by a presentation of a newly developed numerical model for simulating landslide dynamics by David George, USGS.
The session on modeling landslide-generated tsunamis focused on state-of-the-art hydrodynamic modeling of long- and intermediate-length waves associated with this unique type of tsunami. Juan Horrillo, Texas A&M University at Galveston, compared conventional two-horizontal-dimension (2HD) models with three-dimensional (3D) models. Laboratory experiments used to validate hydrodynamic models were described by Stéphan Grilli, University of Rhode Island. Patrick Lynett, University of Southern California, used nonlinear Boussinesq-type models to show how probabilistic variations in down-slope landslide length can be evaluated. For the final presentation in this session, Frank González, University of Washington, showed how numerical hydrodynamic models are used in probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis (PTHA), providing a transition to the final session of the workshop.
The session on probability of landslides and landslide-generated tsunamis began with a presentation by Hong-Kie Thio, URS Corporation, about how probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis has been applied in the Pacific Basin and how disaggregation (percentage contribution of different sources) can provide important information about which source regions dominate the probabilistic calculations. A version of probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis specific to submarine landslides was presented by Christopher Baxter, University of Rhode Island, in which geotechnical calculations were combined with knowledge of how tsunami amplitude correlates with the size of the landslide to estimate tsunami hazards for the U.S. east coast. A method to determine landslide probabilities over a broad region by using seafloor databases, such as usSEABED (see related Sound Waves article), was presented by Eugene Morgan, Duke University. Eric Geist, USGS, synthesized the results of the workshop into a presentation about the approaches and challenges of incorporating submarine landslides into probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis. Annie Kammerer, NRC, then talked about the challenges facing the NRC in providing guidelines to power companies for tsunami-hazard mitigation.
The workshop presentations provided a summary of current thinking related to submarine landslides, their probability, and the complex hydrodynamics of landslide-generated tsunamis. Consensus from the presentations and discussion was that acquisition of additional geological and geophysical data, particularly age-dates from past landslide events, is necessary before probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis can be conducted at NRC-relevant design probabilities. However, probabilistic and statistical methods using available site-specific and regional geologic data can yield estimates of, for example, the probability associated with the “worst-case” scenario.

The Gospel of Judas, Part 10
This section will be about Jesus talking about the destruction of the wicked with Judas & others. The others I assume are the other disciples. Possibly some close followers, like Mary Magdalene. Enjoy!
The text in this passage is missing lines in the original text. I’ll do my best, bear with me. “…light (nearly 2 lines missing) around…let…spirit that is within you dwell in this flesh among the generations of angels. But God caused knowledge to be given to Adam & those with him, so that the kings of chaos & the underworld might not lord it over them.” Judas said to Jesus, “So what will those generations do?” Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, for all of them the stars bring matters to completion. When Saklas completes the span of time assigned for him, their first star will appear with the generations, & they will finish what they said they would do. Then they will fornicate in my name & slay their children & they will…& (about 6 lines missing) my name, & he will…your stars over the 13th aeon.” After that Jesus laughed. Judas said, “Why are you laughing at us?” (I’m assuming that ‘us’ is the other disciples.) Jesus answered & said, “I’m not laughing at you but at the error of the stars, because these 6 stars wander about 5 combatants, & they all will be destroyed along with their creatures.”
This passage suggests that gnōsis, or knowledge, was given to Adam & through that humanity. The way in which Adam & humanity comes to possess knowledge is explained on other “forbidden” gnostic texts (including Sethian texts). In these texts, it’s asserted that humanity has knowledge but the megalomaniacal (a person/entity obsessed with their own power, kinda like Donald Trump!) rulers of this world don’t. The references to the stars, their influences, & their eventual destruction are astronomical & apocalyptic. The 5 wandering stars are most likely the 5 planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, & Saturn) along with the moon. According to ancient astronomical & astrological theories, wandering stars can rule over us & influence our lives.

Εffectively, Im surprisｅd you all left the
very further best one for me.? Ⅾaddy said witһ
a teasing smile. ?It?s that he despatched Jesus to die for us and
provіdes us life eternally and ever and that due to that we wiⅼl
be a household in heaven foor hundreds of thousands of years.
That?s pretty go᧐d isnt it?

An important component is the development of novel physics based models and detailed simulation capabilities not only to understand the fundamental physics, but also to explore the design space for next generation vehicle propulsion platforms. This research associateship is a critical part of on-going mission programs towards developing adaptive propulsion technologies, including fuel-flexible operations, for current and future Army vehicles. This research will focus on the development of accurate physics based models to be deployed on DoD leadership High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities leveraging exceptional computational resources and teaming with internal and cross-directorate experts in computational sciences. The models developed will have direct links to experimental facilities at ARL Vehicle Research Laboratory and external collaborators for validation and concept vetting efforts. Research proposals are invited to develop first principle and engineering models for multiphase turbulent flows, including Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), or RANS models, as well as, as One-Dimensional-Turbulence (ODT) stochastic models, or Linear Eddy Mixing (LEM), computational frameworks, such as LEMLES. Data reduction and in-situ visualization techniques are also desired for big data processing (TBs) and interpretation/presentation of scientific data. The areas of technical interest include, but are not limited to, interface-tracking methods (e.g., VOF, LS), hybrid methods (Eulerian-Lagrangian); chemical kinetic models based on finite rate chemistry, tabulated kinetic models, or novel methods that improve the computational CPU cost; and fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) models for jet engine optimization under off-design conditions. Some possible research topics include: a. Develop improved physics based interface tracking models based on VOF or LS methods to simulate spray breakup under turbulent flow environments using HPC resources for massively parallel computations. Development of sub-grid scale (SGS) models for complex multiphase flows in LES framework. Develop a deep understanding of the fuel injection physics including internal nozzle flow instabilities (e.g., cavitation), primary breakup, and transcritical mixing and thermodynamics based on the state-of-the-art theoretical formulations. b. Develop computational tools and combustion models that are mode or regime independent based on the Linear Eddy Mixing (LEM) methodologies to enable more accurate simulations of unsteady non-premixed turbulent combustion, extinction/re-ignition physics with comparison to DNS or laboratory measurements. c. Advance Lagrangian particle transport and deposition models in turbulent flow environments to simulate complex multi-physics sand ingestion processes in jet engines, phase-change, and solidification in E/TBC. Develop concepts and strategies to create sand phobic engineered materials to improve the performance of coatings under high temperature conditions. The candidate will have a deep knowledge of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model development, mesh generation techniques, turbulence models, MPI/OpenMPI protocols, High Performance Computing and scalability analysis for massively parallel computations. The team will work closely with ARL staff in the Vehicle Technology Directorate, as well as cross-directorate collaboration from Computational & Information Science Directorate to closely interact with the data analysis and scientific visualization team, and HPC scientists. Data visualization hardware and software resources mentioned in (Su et al, 2018) will be available to the candidate. The nature of the work will also require establishing close collaborations with experimentalists from Vehicle Research Laboratory, and relevant external partners from academia, industry and national laboratories.

Socialist Ocasio-Cortez: Dems Can’t Compromise With ‘Insane People’ On The Right

Anyone who disagrees with her half-baked talking-points is insane?
She sounds like a twelve-year-old.
With apologies to twelve-year-olds, everywhere.
Via Free Beacon.
Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a new interview her party couldn’t compromise with the “insane people” on the right holding the country “hostage.”
Asked by Vanity Fair how she intended to balance her desire for rapid, progressive change with the need in Washington to make deals, Ocasio-Cortez said Democrats too often compromise even before getting to the table.
“When you’re dealing with these insane people holding the country hostage on the right, you can’t go in with your end point. You have to go in with a strong position,” she said. “If they’re trying to end Planned Parenthood, I don’t think we go in with, ‘No, let’s keep Planned Parenthood.’ I think we go in with, ‘Let’s expand women’s rights to health care and have it guaranteed in every state.’ I think we can compromise on our tactics and how we get there, but we can’t compromise where we’re going.”….

Fracking Free and Renewable Ready
by Maisie Keogh · December 5, 2017
Credit: Mikel Martinez de Osaba via flickr.com
Scotland is a nation rich in natural resources, from our valuable wave and wind assets to the country’s tidal and hydroelectric power. Yet hidden beneath the densely populated Central Lowlands is another resource, one that the Scottish Government has vowed to leave deeply buried, avoiding serious environmental pollution and keeping Scotland on track to meet its target of drawing half its energy from renewables by 2030 1. This monumental decision not only safeguards the country’s own ambitious Climate Change Plan 2 but also reaffirms its commitments to The Paris Agreement 3.
Scotland has been capitalising on its North Sea oil reserves for over 50 years and following a downturn, oil production peaked in 1999 with the recovery of approximately 133 million tonnes of oil and 47million tonnes of natural gas 4. However, as Scotland’s total share of revenue from North Sea oil and gas fell drastically from around £26 billion in 2014 to just £19 billion 5 in 2015, attention turned to onshore unconventional oil and gas reservoirs within shale rock. Extracted using hydraulic fracturing or ‘fracking’ it was seen as a viable source of revenue.
There has been extensive exploitation of shale gas in the USA over the past forty years, with 2007-2013 seeing a 13% reduction in the energy generated from coal and a 25% increase in the use of fracking technology. Furthermore, with the creation of over 100,000 jobs in some areas, and 300,000 wells in operation in 2015, the exploitation of this form of natural gas certainly has had numerous benefits for the American economy 6.
On this side of the Atlantic however, fracking has not been met with the same enthusiasm. The UK government backs the use of unconventional gas and oil extraction. However, negative public opinion and fears over the safety and environmental impact of fracking, saw a temporary moratorium imposed in 2011. The persuasive arguments from both policy makers and the public which led to this decision were bolstered by the occurrence of two minor earthquakes near to the Preese Hall drilling site by Preston. Both earthquakes were linked to the fracking occurring in the area as investigated by The British Geological Survey. Despite this temporary environmental reprieve, 2013 saw further shale gas appraisal wells constructed along the Lancashire coast and shale oil exploration conducted in West Sussex.
Undeterred by the UK Government’s declaration that every precaution will be taken to “ensure on-site safety, prevent environmental contamination, mitigate seismic activity and minimise greenhouse gas emissions” 7, a more “cautious and evidence-led approach” 8 has been taken by the Scottish Government.
Scotland’s unique geology in the Central Belt means that an abundance of shale gas and oil is available for possible extraction. The British Geological Survey estimates these reserves to be in the region of 1399-3811 trillion litres 9, potentially worth billions to the Scottish economy. Nonetheless, the Scottish Government, following a lengthy public consultation, has now put in place an indefinite moratorium preventing fracking taking place in this region. The consultation, which closed at the end of May, was an important opportunity for the Scottish Government to encourage open and honest debate, to reaffirm its pledge to sustainable energy goals and demonstrate greater responsibility to the planet by meeting its greenhouse gas emissions mitigation targets. This dialogue ended with 99% of the 65,000 respondents concurring with the government’s opinion that fracking had no future here and energy minister Paul Wheelhouse concluding that “fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland”.
So, what’s next? From hydro to heat and wind to geothermal, how can we use the valuable renewable resources we have available, while continuing to meet rising energy demands and ensuring our emissions targets are met? The Scottish Government’s objective is for “renewable sources to generate the equivalent of 100% of Scotland’s gross annual electrical consumption by 2020 with renewable sources to provide the equivalent of 11% of Scotland’s heat by 2020” and with an abundance of natural resources to take advantage of, by 2015 we had already hit the 50% provisional objective 10.
However, Scotland’s climate is very vulnerable to something called the North Atlantic Oscillation. This is a measure of the pressure gradient between Iceland and Portugal, which has a major impact on wind speeds and sea currents and hence wind and wave energy. As a single wind turbine has the ability to produce enough electricity to fuel approximately 1400 homes, a strong North Atlantic Oscillation 11 can have an appreciable impact on the number of households fuelled by this energy. Estimates suggest that a quarter of the offshore wind energy used in Europe crosses Scotland’s coastal areas and as such the Scottish Government sees this type of renewable energy as one of the “biggest opportunities for sustainable growth” 12. The topography of our country is also highly suited to the generation of electricity from onshore wind and in recent years this has become a highly lucrative business, not just in Scotland but around the world. The biggest windfarm in the UK is Whitelee, just outside Glasgow, home to 215 turbines fueling over 300,00 households by producing in excess of 539 megawatts 13.
Another key resource is tidal energy. Waves with speeds of up to 19 mph have been recorded in the north-west of Scotland in areas around the Orkney Islands and the Pentland Firth. With a 1.5 MW (Megawatts) turbine already installed and three more planned, this type of technology has the ability to generate enough electricity to fuel the nation for many years to come 14. Notably, in August the turbines generated enough energy to power over 2000 homes, producing a record-breaking 700 megawatt hours of electricity. This was not just a record for Scotland but for the entire world.
While Scotland’s coastal regions are rich sources of clean, renewable power, the Highlands have an abundance of developed forests and woodlands which provide the perfect resource for exploring biomass as an energy source. Biomass is already well established in places like Scandinavia and arises from the combustion of organic material to produce energy in the form of heat. With a number of ambitious projects already underway in Orkney and with more planned, biomass is establishing a reputation as a self-sufficient and reliable source of sustainable energy.
It is not just our homes that can be powered by renewables, alternative fuels also have a crucial role to play in Scotland’s future. Hydrogen fuel cells, for example, could be used to power our public transportation. As a fuel source it is highly efficient and non-toxic with water being the only product of combustion (see diagram). Hydrogen-fuelled vehicles have been commercially available since 2015, and China has developed a number of trams and bikes using this technology to help combat their serious air pollution problems. However, it can’t be ignored that there are disadvantages to this technology. It can be expensive to extract and potentially dangerous to store due to its flammability which requires it to be kept in high pressure conditions.

The decision to overcome our greed for fossil fuels and turn our backs on fracking has been a vital step towards powering our country using renewable and sustainable sources. The ambitious energy targets set for 2020 mean that a strong commitment to using all of the available resources our nation has to offer, as well as developing innovative technologies, is needed. Scotland has already built an international reputation for its integrity and responsibility to reduce its emissions and with fracking now firmly in the past, clean and efficient energy sources are very much in our future.

Trump Promised To “Bomb The Sh*t” Out Of ISIS. Reports Show He’s Been Doing Just That.

Over two years ago, then-candidate Donald Trump made a promise to the American people that he would “bomb the sh*t” out of ISIS.
Here’s quick video proof:
Now, eight months into his presidency, he’s doing just that. With the assistance of Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis, the administration has effectively unleashed hell upon ISIS, dropping twice as many bombs on ISIS than former President Obama’s last full year in office.
On Tuesday, Military.com reported that the Air Force — in August alone — released more than 500 weapons in Afghanistan against Taliban, al-Qaida, and ISIS, which is the most in a single month since 2012.
NM reports:
According to the latest airpower summary, fighter jets and drones have dropped more than 2,000 bombs this year — already almost doubling the number of weapons released during all of last year.
Military.com noted the increase comes as President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Pentagon top brass met to talk about a new strategy for Afghanistan.
“We’re in the process of doing the detailed planning [for] that strategy,” Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein told Military.com last week.
Trump on Aug. 22 announced the U.S. will send more troops to Afghanistan to step up the fight against the Taliban and the offshoot of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria called Islamic State-Khorasan province, or IS-K.
The president would not cite specific numbers, but defense officials have said 3,500 to 5,000 additional troops are likely as part of the plan.

Two tiffin-box crude bombs were hurled at the office of Tamil news channel Puthiya Thalaimurai on Thursday morning (12 March 2015). The bombs exploded with a loud noise, but no one was injured nor was any property damaged. This attack was in response to the Puthiya Thalaimurai Channel that had planned to air a debate-programme on the thali or mangalsutra.

University (album)
University is the 1995 album by the American alternative rock band Throwing Muses, released on Sire Records and Reprise Records in the USA, and on 4AD elsewhere. It features the single "Bright Yellow Gun", the band's first national hit. The album's radio exposure led to feature articles in Rolling Stone and other major music magazines.
The album was recorded in the fall of 1993, right before lead Muse Kristin Hersh recorded her first solo album, Hips and Makers. 4AD founder and president Ivo Watts-Russell convinced Hersh to release the solo album first, in early 1994. This led to this album being delayed until 1995.
Despite all the positive notices and exposure for the album, sales were disappointingly low, and the band was dropped from Sire's roster, ending the Muses' major label years. The band has continued sporadically ever since, releasing two more albums on the independent 4AD, one in 1996 and one in 2003, before releasing 2013's Purgatory/Paradise on their own label.

University (Metro Rail)
University (formerly South Campus until September 1, 2003) is a Buffalo Metro Rail station located near the intersection of Main Street and Niagara Falls Boulevard on the University at Buffalo South Campus. It is a major transfer point between Metro Rail and many city and suburban bus routes, and offers a unique "Kiss and Ride" facility on the top level, above the ticket mezzazine. This allows drivers of automobiles a separate area to drop off passengers, so they do not add to the traffic congestion from buses at the station during rush-hour periods and a large park-and-ride facility directly to the east of the station. Since University Station serves as a terminal, immediately south is a double crossover. From May 20, 1985 to November 10, 1986, due to construction issues at LaSalle Station, Amherst Street Station served as the northern terminus. Since November 10, 1986, University Station serves as the northern terminus.
Bus routes serving University Station

Madurai Kamaraj University, is on its relentless journey for the past 51 years surmounting hurdles of indigenous and exotic nature on its way and has passed through the tests of accreditation towards reaching the status of excellence. University is aware that the process of achieving excellence is continuous and therefore, all efforts are in progress to keep up the momentum. The University came into being through a bill passed in the Legislative Assembly of the State in the year 1965. Thus, it is a statutory university owned and funded by the Government of Tamilnadu and the University Grants Commission. This University is a member of Association of Indian Universities and one of the nine universities in India with a status of University with Potential for Excellence. The present Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Alagappa University and Mother Theresa University are the off- shoots of Madurai kamaraj University. As on date, it covers four revenue districts of Madurai, Virudhunagar, Dindugal and Theni for its regular academic programme. Currently it holds a total of 77 renowned Departments and 20 Schools. In addition to the Departments and Schools, the University has 21 academic centres and 21 quasi academic supportive units. It has 24 autonomous colleges, 14 aided colleges, 33 self financing colleges, 18 approved institutions, 4 evening colleges, 6 constituent colleges and one University College catering to the higher education needs of large number of students from rural and urban areas. The Madurai Kamaraj University offers 41 post graduate, 35 M.Phil. and 17 Diploma / P.G. Diploma / Certificate courses in the various departments. Presently, 66 U.G. and 45 P.G. courses are offered in the affiliated Colleges. At present 2428 students and research scholars are on the roll. Currently more than 163 individual research projects are being carried out with an outlay exceeding 34 Crores. The University has a modernized central Library with 3 lakhs books, 9,000 e-journals, 3,000 e-books, 55,000 reference and text books. The one Gbps internet connection, INFONET centre with 50 nodes and smart class rooms have enriched the ICT enabled teaching and learning. Madurai Kamaraj University strongly believes in de-centralised and participatory governance. As a visionary step, academic and administrative autonomy has been granted to select Schools. The University has established linkages with community around through its various outreach activities. The National and International level connectivity and visibility of this University is a pointer that the University is moving from the status of University with Potential for Excellence to the status of University of Excellence.

CNN’s Acosta calls for Trump to halt media attacks
Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta says President Donald Trump’s attacks on the media must stop or there’s a risk someone will get hurt.
Acosta is one of the most visible members of the press corps covering Trump and a target for verbal abuse at the president’s rallies.
He said Monday that Trump has, in Acosta’s words, “normalized and sanitized nastiness and cruelty” in an unprecedented way.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Acosta and others at a CNN–sponsored conference talked about dealing with the president’s untruths.
Former Watergate sleuth Carl Bernstein said the press has to be more than Trump’s lie–catchers.

World news
World news or international news or even foreign coverage is the news media jargon for news from abroad, about a country or a global subject. For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or — more recently — information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet.
Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.
Actually, at the birth of modern journalism, most news were actually foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenbüttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

World News (newspaper)
The World News (Chinese: 菲律賓世界日報; pinyin: Fēilǜbīn Shìjiè Rìbào; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Hui-li̍p-pin Sè-kài Ji̍t-pò, lit. "Philippine World News") is a daily broadsheet newspaper in the Philippines written in the Chinese language. Founded in 1981 after the lifting of martial law, it is currently the Philippines' largest Chinese-language newspaper in terms of circulation.
History
The World News was founded in 1981 by Florencio Tan Mallare (Chinese: 陳華岳; pinyin: Chén Huáyuè; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tân Hôa-ga̍k), a lawyer from Macalelon, Quezon who also worked as a reporter for the Chinese Commercial News. After the normalization of relations between the Philippines and the People's Republic of China in 1975, Mallare established the World News as an alternative to the largely pro-Taiwan, pro-Kuomintang mainstream Chinese-language press, catering to both Chinese Filipinos who would prefer news about China from other points of view as well as the growing number of mainland Chinese migrants to the Philippines who did not necessarily share the pro-Taiwan stance of more established Chinese Filipinos.

World news
World news or international news or even foreign coverage is the news media jargon for news from abroad, about a country or a global subject. For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or — more recently — information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet.
Although in most of the English-speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.
Actually, at the birth of modern journalism, most news were actually foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenbüttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

The investigation into Russia's role in the election of President Donald Trump has taken yet another twist, but this time it's the Justice Dept.'s turn on the hot seat. Last Friday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) released a memo alleging the investigation is tainted. Why? In seeking a warrant to spy on former Trump campaign operative Carter Page, the memo says the FBI and Justice relied on the infamous Steele Dossier. The unverified dossier, compiled by former MI6 intelligence officer Christopher Steele, alleged that Russian intelligence agencies have blackmail material on Trump and that the Kremlin cultivated him as a presidential candidate as far back as 2011. According to the Nunes memo, the dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, adding that Steele wasn't even a reliable agent. The memo would cast shade on the entire investigation by suggesting it has become politicized… if it were entirely true. But as Democrats and journalists alike were quick to point out, surveillance of Page was based on more than just the Steele Dossier, and the Nunes memo omits key facts proving that. For its misleading content, the memo gets 83 percent negative sentiments online, with many calling it bogus. –Hugo Guzman

Classic Car Insurance
Enthusiasm is contagious
Choosing the right collector car insurance is critical. That's why American National provides clients with reliable, consistent service. We have firsthand knowledge of the concerns collector car and truck owners face and we've created a policy with the coverage and enhancements you need to protect your valuable investment.
Your local agent can help you make a well-informed decision about your classic car insurance. They will work to help you feel confident you are getting the best protection for your collector vehicle and everything else you care about most.
Agreed Value Coverage
If your vehicle is declared a total loss in a covered accident, we will pay you the vehicle’s insured value with no depreciation (minus your deductible).
Generous Annual Mileage
Our policy allows you to drive up to 10,000 miles annually. An unlimited annual mileage option is available for owners that drive their collector car more than 10,000 miles per year.
Roadside Service and Flatbed Towing Option
Whether you have a mechanical breakdown, run out of gas or lock your keys in your vehicle, our optional Emergency Roadside Assistance endorsement with flatbed towing (when available) could help you 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Repair Facility Choice
You have the freedom to decide which repair facility will fix your vehicle if it’s damaged in a covered accident.
Spare Parts Coverage
If you own spare parts for your insured collector vehicle, and they are damaged or destroyed by a covered loss, we will give you up to $1,000 to replace them.
Common Cause of Loss Deductible
If both your vehicle and your home are insured with us, our Common Cause of Loss Deductible only requires you to pay one deductible if your car and home are damaged or destroyed in a single event.
Fresh Start Discount®
If you apply for an auto policy with us before your current one expires, we’ll reward you with a discount on your first six months of coverage. Learn more about the Fresh Start Discount®.
Three Line Discount
When you insure your vehicle, home and life with us, you’ll save additional money on your qualifying auto and home premiums.
Collector’s Discount
Your discount increases with the number of qualifying collector vehicles on your account, all the way up to 85%. More than one vehicle must have liability coverage. The more cars or trucks you insure with us, the greater the discount you’ll receive.
Reach out to an agent today to learn more about the benefits of American National collector car insurance and to get a free quote.
Go Paperless
Go Paperless1 with your Collector Car policy documents today and avoid more paper cluttering up your life.
When you enroll in paperless you’ll be able to access your policy documents online whenever and wherever you need them.

The Museum is renowned for its vivid dioramas that depict species as they lived in the past. But how do scientists rebuild lifelike human ancestors from pieces of fossil remains? How can we look our human ancestors in the eye? Build your own detailed reconstruction of a hominid ancestor using forensic science and fossil casts. In this course, we will examine fossil skull casts from human relatives to sculpt facial reconstructions on 3D-printed skulls. We will examine differences in skulls, create detailed facial musculature, apply tissue-depth markers, and make interpretations about where they lived and how they died. Take home your very own sculpted reconstruction of a hominin face from the past!
Meeting Times: Fridays 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM

Overview
A longtime Washington insider argues that former FBI Director James Comey's letter to Congress, sent just before the presidential election in 2016 was a key determining factor in Trump's win: "Compelling criticism...lapsed Trump supporters might well open their minds to this attorney's scholarly, entirely convincing proof of the damage done" (Kirkus Reviews, starred review).
During the week of October 24, 2016, Hillary Clinton was decisively ahead of Donald Trump in many polls and, more importantly, in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Then FBI Director James Comey sent his infamous letter to Congress on October 28, saying the bureau was investigating additional emails that may have been relevant to the Hillary Clinton email case. In The Unmaking of the President 2016, attorney Lanny J. Davis shows how Comey's misguided announcement--just eleven days before the election--swung a significant number of voters away from Clinton, winning Trump an Electoral College victory--and the presidency.
Davis traces Clinton's email controversy and Comey's July 2016 appearance before Congress, in which he said the Clinton email matter was effectively closed. From that moment until Comey's late October letter to Congress, Davis says, Clinton was destined to be elected president by substantial popular and electoral vote margins. But the decision to send his October 28 letter, so near to the election, not only violated long-standing justice department policies but also contained no new facts of improper emails at all--just pure speculation. Davis shows state by state, using polling data before October 28, and on election day, how voter support for Hillary Clinton eroded quickly. He proves that had the election been held on October 27, Hillary Clinton would have won the presidency by a substantial margin.
Despite so many other issues in the closing days of the campaign--Trump's behavior, the Russian hacking, reports of Clinton momentum in marginal states such as Georgia, Arizona, even Texas--after the October 28 Comey letter, everything changed. References to "Clinton emails" and "new criminal investigation" dominated media coverage virtually round-the-clock through election day November 8. Now Davis proves with raw, indisputable data how Comey's October surprise cost Hillary Clinton the presidency and changed American history in the blink of an eye.

Obama: No Regrets on Syria ‘Red Line’
TRENT BAKER
15 Jan 2017
During the Sunday airing of his interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” President Barack Obama said he has zero regret for using the phrase “red line” in 2012 when he promised to retaliate against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime if it used chemical weapons.
Host Steve Kroft noted how the phrase has since resurfaced and has caused problems in the ongoing Syrian conflict.
“I’ve got to tell you, though, I don’t regret at all saying that if I saw Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons on his people that that would change my assessments in terms of what we were or were not willing to do in Syria,” he told Kroft.

Johnny Depp spoofs Donald Trump in 'Funny or Die' movie

Washington (CNN)Johnny Depp is no stranger to outlandish film roles, but he has never tried his hand -- or hair -- at newly crowned New Hampshire GOP primary winner Donald Trump.
Until now.
Presented by the comedy site "Funny or Die," the actor stars in a nearly hour-long spoof called "Funny or Die Presents Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie."
Depp plays Trump alongside an impressive slate of Hollywood regulars, including Ron Howard and Patton Oswalt.
The movie is presented as a lost classic, with Howard explaining in the opening scene that its initial planned airing in 1988 was pre-empted by "Monday Night Football," then "thought to be lost in the Cybill Shepherd blouse fire of 1989," before "last summer, when it turned up at a yard sale outside Phoenix, Arizona."

Mothers Opposing Minors’ Separation (M.O.M.S)
0 have signed. Let’s get to 1,000!
Allyssa Brooke started this petition to Senator Elizabeth Warren and
2 others
I simply can not. I can not read one more story of a child ripped from his mother’s arms unnecessarily. Scared. Afraid. Alone.
The negative psychological impact of a child removed from his mother’s care is well documented. It increases exponentially when the removal is abrupt and traumatic, as in the case of Mirian G. Mirian was seeking political asylum in the United States to escape violence in Honduras, when her 18 month old son was torn from her arms by border patrol agents without explanation. Unable to comfort her crying baby, she watched helplessly as he was driven away. She did not see her son for over 2 months! As a mother, I can not fathom the fear and worry that would come from not knowing where my child would be taken, or if I would see him again. God willing, I will never know that kind of heartache. Sadly, Mirian’s story is not unique. There are mothers living this nightmare at this very moment.
Please join me in letting Congress know that this barbaric and unconscionable practice is not acceptable:
We, the voting, tax-paying citizens of these United States of America, hereby demand that the grotesquely inhumane practice of separating minors from their parents at border control locations stop immediately. Regardless of their nationality, children deserve to sleep in the arms of their mothers, not detention centers or the home of a stranger. People seeking asylum are not the enemy. Hate is our enemy. Racism is our enemy. Ignorance is our enemy. Our ally must be love.
“Bring me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
This is not a partisan issue. This is a humanitarian issue.
Thank you.

As soon as Jair Bolsonaro was confirmed as president-elect of Brazil on Oct. 28, the media rushed to his condo in Rio de Janeiro for the first official announcement. With his wife by his side and other friends, Bolsonaro said that, before doing anything, they would pray.
Senator Magno Malta (also a gospel singer), thanked God and prayed for a new time for the nation.
That was a first in Brazil's history. In fact, the role of evangelical figures in this election was historic, and prayer was common throughout Bolsonaro's campaign. As many pastors and evangelical leaders gathered around the candidate, polls showed that although his victory was deemed unlikely, he would become Brazil's next president.
Two months later, Bolsonaro's name is well-known outside Brazil. Now, he is receiving prayers not only from Brazilian pastors, but from other countries as well.

This week Mario Bramnick, president of the Latino Coalition for Israel, led a team of evangelical leaders to meet with the president-elect as well as Brazilian political and religious leaders in Brasilia, where they met future cabinet members including Damares Alves, the pastor nominated as the secretary of human rights.
Bramnick believes Damares "will do an amazing work as secretary, fighting for Human Rights and religious freedom in Brazil and abroad."
On Dec. 20 Bramnick, along with American pastors Jim and Rosemary Garlow, founders of Well Versed Ministries; Ramiro Pena, president of Ramiro Pena Ministries, along with his wife, Orphalinda; Albert Veksler; and Brazilian Pastor Josue Valandro, had an opportunity to meet Bolsonaro and pray with him. Pastor Pena gave the president elect an Israeli prayer shawl, thanking him for all his support for Israel.
Veksler, director of the Jerusalem Prayer Breakfast, said of Bolsonaro: "We are thankful for President Bolsonaro's stand for Jerusalem and his friendship with Israel.

Jim Garlow says, "We are very thankful for the opportunity to stand with President-elect Bolsonaro in solidarity with him. Evangelical Christians in the U.S. are very aware of his role in the new political scenario in South America and are praying vigorously for his health and the prosperity of the nation."
Rosemary Garlow echoed her husband's sentiments.
"Evangelical Christians of America are honored to visit Brazil and to stand with the elected government at this crucial moment," she said.
"We are very thankful to be here and to pray for Brazil. We love this nation and its people," Ramiro Pena said.
Bramnick says he believes Bolsonaro and Brazil will move forward with God's blessings.
"We strongly believe that the hand of God is upon President Bolsonaro and that God has a tremendous purpose for the future of Brazil."
Valandro, who leads Igreja Batista Atitude in Rio, which Bolsonaro's family attends, said, "I am very happy to be with my brothers and sisters from other countries, showing that we are walking in unity, and we deeply believe this opportunity to pray with leaders from the USA and Israel has a prophetic meaning."

(Dialing, phone ringing)
CLINIC: Good afternoon. Planned Parenthood, West Islip. Lisa speaking. Can I ask you to hold a moment?
CALLER: Sure.
CLINIC: Thanks.
RECORDING: — -PLAN to be connected directly to the center nearest you. You can also visit our Web site at www.plannedparenthood.org.
Our clients count on our caring staff for annual check-ups, birth control information, family planning supplies —
CLINIC: Hi. How can I help you?
CALLER: Hi. I was wondering, do you guys do abortions there?
CLINIC: No, not here. But I can give you the number where they do them. We can run your pregnancy test and give you some counseling if you need that.
CALLER: Okay. Do you know if they would have to tell my parents or anything?
CLINIC: No.
CALLER: Okay. The problem is, they can’t tell my parents at all because my boyfriend’s 22. And we’re going to get married, but my parents hate him because they think he’s too old for me.
CLINIC: Okay. That’s confidential.
CALLER: Okay. And they wouldn’t have to tell anybody at all?
CLINIC: No.
CALLER: All right.
CLINIC: Okay? Do you want to come in for a pregnancy test?
CALLER: Yeah, I guess.
CLINIC: Hold on one second. Can you hold on?
CALLER: Yeah.
CLINIC: Okay.
RECORDING: — sliding fee scale based on income and family size. Special consideration is made regarding the income for teens 17 and under. Testing and counseling for HIV are always free to our established clients. We accept Medicaid, major credit cards, and several health insurance plans. For more information, please, just ask.
Good news for Medicaid participants —
CLINIC: Okay, hi.
CALLER: Hi.
CLINIC: All right. So you want to come in for your pregnancy test, right?
CALLER: Yeah.
CLINIC: Okay. Hold on one second.
CALLER: There’s not like an age requirement for that or anything, is there?
CLINIC: Excuse me?
CALLER: You don’t have to be a specific age to get a pregnancy test?
CLINIC: No.
CALLER: Because I’ll be 14 in March. And that’s still all right?
CLINIC: That’s fine. A pregnancy test, we don’t need your parents’ permission. You don’t need your parents’ permission, okay?
CALLER: Okay. Do you guys need to tell my parents anything at all?
CLINIC: No, absolutely not. A woman has the right to consent to your own care, women’s care. So the only reason they would have to get your parents involved would be if you were going to have medication, like a life-threatening thing or anything like that.
CALLER: Oh, okay. So it’s all right if my boyfriend brings me and everything.
CLINIC: That’s fine. We’re not going to say anything. It’s totally confidential.
CALLER: Okay.
CLINIC: Okay?
CALLER: All right.
CLINIC: When did you want to come in, first of all?
CALLER: Well, I would have to see when he can get off work and come and take me.
CLINIC: So then you’re going to call me back? Is that what you want to do?
CLINIC: For a pregnancy test, you can just come in — you can pretty much come in at any time. We’re open until 8:30. We do prefer that you call so we can put you into the book so that you have a time slot. Let’s say you don’t have an appointment and it’s packed in here, all those people are going to go before you. If you have an appointment, you have a scheduled time. You understand what I’m trying to say?
CALLER: Yeah. Say I ended up not being pregnant, do you guys do birth control there?
CLINIC: Of course. Absolutely.
CALLER: And you wouldn’t have to tell anybody about that either?
CLINIC: No. You consent to your own women’s health care. You don’t have to be of age to consent for your own care, for women’s health that is.
CALLER: Okay. So no one has to know anything about anything?
CLINIC: Absolutely not.
CALLER: And it’s all right if my boyfriend comes in with me and everything?
CLINIC: He can come in. That’s fine. That’s fine. You need somebody to bring you, right?
CALLER: Yeah. And no one will say anything about that or anything?
CLINIC: We’re not going to say anything. That’s totally — you don’t even have to say that he’s your boyfriend. They don’t ask who’s coming in with you. That’s none of our business.
CALLER: All right, okay.
CLINIC: We’re here to take care of you and provide services to you.
CALLER: Okay.
CLINIC: Okay? Do you want to call me back?
CALLER: Yeah. What was your name?
CLINIC: My name is Joanne.
CALLER: Joanne? All right. Okay.
CLINIC: Bye.
CALLER: Thanks.
CLINIC: Okay. Bye.

Why Are They Gunning for Gorsuch?
View all posts from this blog
By:William Murchison | April 05, 2017
An uncomplimentary picture takes shape in the mind: the Senate's Democratic minority (save for a higher-minded handful) standing in a row, thumbs affixed to noses, fingers waving provocatively in the air, mouths emitting a rude sound commonly known as "the raspberry." Think we're going to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court?! Think we're going to apply brains and reasoning power to the defense of constitutional liberty?! Think we're going to behave like adults?! Adults, for crying out loud?!
Everybody with a brain cell in gear understands the frequent ugliness of politics. Politics at bottom is about power—the power to tell others what we're going to do and what we're not. That inescapable consideration renders the whole business contentious and, more than occasionally, mean and lowdown.
The Gorsuch "controversy"—which isn't a controversy based on real differences of legitimate opinion, else the superbly qualified Gorsuch would be confirmed hands-down—illustrates, largely enough for an IMAX screen, the mean and lowdown side of the political power struggle.
Democrats have no more cause to filibuster Gorsuch than they have to strip Malia Obama of U.S. citizenship. They desire, mainly, to give Donald Trump their version of the bird—for offenses having nothing to do with the Gorsuch nomination.
Oh, yes, there's the pretend "issue" of how the Republicans denied a hearing to President Barack Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the high court. They did deny such a hearing, for reasons that represent how morally lost our politics have become; to wit, Garland's confirmation (however welcome it might have been at another time) would have cemented the ascendancy of the court's left-to-liberal bloc. That would have crushed Republican hopes for neutralizing the court's growing power to continue legislating in an unanswerable way, removed from redress and accountability.
The Republican refusal to consider Garland's nomination, near the end of Obama's term, was rough but never mean stuff. It signaled the expected birth of a chance to put on the court someone of conservative kidney; then it drew renewed notice to the once unthinkable burgeoning of the court's role as Olympian arbiter of everything, telling the peasants what they were to do, like it or not. For which lamentable state of affairs blame attaches chiefly to the judicial "progressives" Senate Democrats want on the high court, rather than the likes of Neil Gorsuch.
To the extent one sees Senate Democrats as having at least a procedural point about the treatment of the Garland nomination, a counter-objection arises: As our mothers (God bless 'em) used to tell us, two wrongs don't make a right. Unless the doers of the wrongs, past and prospective, start off at some point on level ground, things are going to get worse.
The Gorsuch nomination affords reasonable Democrats—there are still some around—a chance to say, look, we need to do business together, for the nation's sake. We'll vote for Gorsuch, a jurist of magnificence; then we'll see, we'll hope, we'll pray that the next time a Supreme Court seat opens up, we can avoid the phony indignation, the acts of ritual outrage such as befoul the process now. Maybe we can find a way to put the good of the nation first. Wouldn't that be a precedent-breaker: Thinking of the nation over me, myself and I? Respecting the well-being of the country over the aspirations of my party leaders? How about giving the bird to irrational, mean-spirited behavior instead of to democratic procedures and civilized niceties?
We, the people, would come out ahead, that's for sure. There's long been a "lowest common denominator" aspect to democratic politics—our politics. A constant, and insulting, temptation on our leaders' part is that of lowering performance levels to meet the voters' supposed non-standards. What if those same leaders chose to raise, rather than lower, the voters' expectations for virtue and wisdom and honor, not to mention love of country?
The outcome is hard to predict. There have been few, if any, such attempts of late. We might give it a try all the same, by according Neil Gorsuch that which he deserves: the unanimous encouragement of the United States Senate to do justice and seek the common good.

James Gunn rehired by Disney to direct ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’

The reversal comes eight months after Disney fired him.
Nearly eight months after being fired by Disney for a series of years-old tweets that were resurfaced by the far-right, director James Gunn is once again helming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
He tweeted his thanks in a statement, his first tweet since the controversy this summer.

— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) March 15, 2019
The news, which was first reported by Deadline, comes two months after being tapped to direct Suicide Squad 2 for Warner Bros. and DC Comics; he had already been on board to write the script. It is also a rare reversal for Disney, which had stuck to its guns about firing Gunn.
Last summer, far-right media figurehead Mike Cernovich dug up several of Gunn’s tweets from nearly a decade ago where he joked about rape and pedophilia. Gunn, who had already offered a sincere apology for several of those statements years ago and explained that he was attempting satire and he no longer found it funny, wrote another apology that he posted to Twitter.
The decision to fire Gunn was met with anger and derision from fans, many who felt that Disney played right into the hands of the alt-right, who had targeted Gunn in the first place. The cast of the first two Guardians of the Galaxy film wrote an open letter to Disney to show their support for Gunn in a rare demonstration of publicly speaking out against the major studio that employs them. Dave Bautista, who played Drax the Destroyer, had threatened to quit if Gunn’s script wasn’t used and said that he might not return to make the third film. When other directors’ names were suggested to take over directing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, they publicly said to look at Gunn instead.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Disney never carried on a search to replace Gunn but secretly signed a deal with him instead.
Gunn’s brother Sean Gunn, who also appears in the first two Guardians of the Galaxy, posted a screenshot of an article from the Hollywood Reporter with the caption, “I’ll just leave this here.”

A post shared by Sean Gunn (@thejudgegunn) on Mar 15, 2019 at 11:19am PDT
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which Gunn once said would’ve been released in 2020, has been shelved since August 2018. There is no indication of what release schedule Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is working on or how that will affect his commitment to direct Suicide Squad 2, which will be released on Aug. 6, 2021.

Restaurant Review: Pierre’s
Stacy Dermont July 29, 2011
Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Share via Email Print	
I invited Sag Harbor’s greatest living puppeteer, Liz Joyce, from Goat on a Boat Puppet Theatre, to join me for dinner at Pierre’s in Bridgehampton last week. She accepted immediately.
We were seated at a booth, under a speaker that broadcast groovy tunes over us, the funky artwork for sale on the walls, the other tables and the bar.
I like the Euro-cool atmosphere at Pierre’s. I’d been there for lunch, but never for dinner. Dinner is special at Pierre’s…
We each had a Pear Martini – Pear Grey Goose Vodka, pear and nectarine. We quite liked them – they were very peary with a delightful bit of a bite of booze. [expand]
Of course the crispy baguette and accompanying butter were perfection – owner Pierre Weber… IS FRENCH.
Pierre’s Wine List contains many French options as well as selections from the West Coast, South America and local fave Wölffer. Or you could have…beer.
I started with Salad melangee et tomates a la vinaigrette maison (our server was untroubled by my ordering it as “the tomato salad”). The organic mesclun was very fresh and the tomatoes ripe. I would have happily eaten it all, but I thought it best to save some room.
Liz started with Ceviche aux crevettes et coquilles Saint Jacques – with passion fruit and avocado. She raved about it and ate those “little creatures” right up.
I ordered the Bouillabaisse Marseillaise. It was, as expected, perfect. Clams, mussels, shrimp, sea scallops and sea bass poached in a saffron and pastis broth. I lapped it and its traditional rouille up with my toasted baguettes. So good.
Liz ordered the Cotelettes d’ageau aux herbes de Provence, haricots verts et gratin Dauphinois. She glowed. She said she could taste “the sunshine and happy days in the open meadows” that her lamb had enjoyed in Austrailia. She decreed the gratin “a really yummy potato cake.”
Pierre’s is especially known for its desserts. I had the Profiteroles a la glace vanille et sauce chocolat chaud. I discovered that I’d never really had profiteroles before these…not really. So light but sturdy enough to hold ice cream. Warm chocolate sauce with just the right touch of orange and toasted almonds, oh my.
Liz clearly enjoyed her shot of espresso and Moelleux au chocolat Valrhona, glace a la vanille. Chocolate cake and ice cream, ‘works every time.
Of course Pierre has many other desserts from which to choose, including, Napoleon, Tarts, Macaroons, Pear Bourdaloue, Pave d’Alsace and his Sunflower (containing Peach, Blueberry and Almond Cream).
Everything at Pierre’s is Old World – except the jazz. What’s new? All the eggs are now organic, all the beef and lamb is grass-fed, no hormones.
Now in its second year, Pierre’s Gourmet Market next door to the restaurant can’t keep up with the demand for its lobster salad (made with cognac, tarragon, apples and “secrets”). Get in line with local kids in their pajamas – it’s become the hot spot for bedtime ice cream.
Pierre’s is both a neighborhood place and a deeply French culinary outpost.
Pierre’s 2468 Main Street, Bridgehampton, NY. www.pierresbridgehampton.com. 631-537-5110. [/expand]

What’s New Up Freddie Stollmack’s Sleeve?
Elise D’Haene September 2, 2011
Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Share via Email Print	
I caught up recently with marketing guru and retail icon Freddie Stollmack, president of Weatherproof Garment Company and a dedicated East Ender. Last year Stollmack caused quite a ruckus when he had a billboard installed on Times Square of President Obama wearing a Weatherproof jacket on his visit to the Great Wall of China. It was quite a powerful advertisement. The only hitch was, the photo was licensed by the Associated Press and the White House wasn’t too keen on having the President’s name and likeness used for commercial purposes.
The ad campaign created quite a dustup at the time (what doesn’t these days), with headlines like these: “Fur Flies for Using Obama in Ad,” “Obama Hot Under the Collar Over Jacket Ad” and my favorite, “Obama Swag Killed in Times Square.” Boy, advertising can be a rough business. But not everyone grumbled, in fact, a whole lot of people thought that Stollmack had struck gold. One media blogger wrote: “Kudos to Weatherproof Garment and their ad agency for coming up with this bold idea. This has never been done before. They get the benefit of using the face of the most popular man in the world to promote their merchandise, and they didn’t have to pay him or his agent one cent.” [expand]
This month Stollmack will be opening his first 32° Weatherproof® store in Soho. “The new flagship will be influenced by the popular lululemon athletica stores—a shopping experience that alludes to a specific lifestyle. This flagship will also revolutionize retailing by creating a “date night” at the store on Thursdays; shopping will take on a new meaning with cocktails, conversation and a “leave your Blackberry at the door” policy. “Like-minded sports enthusiasts will actually have the experience of talking to each other, rather than texting,” according to Allen Cohen, the company’s spokesman.
Weatherproof® is planning a big 32° retail event at Outdoors of Amagansett in October to coincide with the Hamptons International Film Festival.
I took the opportunity to find out what Stollmack has up his sleeve:
1. What’s your favorite activity in the Hamptons? Relaxing on the beach at Louse Point on late afternoons.
2. What’s your favorite place to go in the Hamptons? The movie house in Sag Harbor and dinner at Dave’s Grill in Montauk.
3. Describe your best East End memory. Horseback riding at Deep Hollow Dude Ranch in 1950, and swimming at the original Surf Club in Montauk from 1948 until it closed.
4. Who would be your dream spokesperson for Weatherproof and why? There are two dreams that have both come to fruition: President Obama, when seen wearing a Weatherproof® jacket at the Great Wall of China, and our recent signing of former New York Yankee, Andy Pettitte, which goes hand-in-hand with our sponsorship of the Yankees.
5. What one person has had the most influence in your life and why? There are two people who have influenced me: Ralph Lauren, because he believes strongly in his intuition, and the founder of Nautica, David Chu, who’s key to success is “focus, focus, focus.”
6. Some say your Obama campaign was genius and others were critical, what are your thoughts about it now? As with all politics today, half the population has one opinion and the other half has another. We think President Obama, having chosen (and by no means endorsed) the Weatherproof® jacket, speaks a lot for the value of our product.
7. What’s the secret to your marketing savvy? Given the clutter in advertising today, we have chosen to take contrarian viewpoints. So if the market is going left…we go right.
8. Your SoHo flagship 32 degrees Weatherproof store opens in September. What are you most excited about? I’m most excited about the focus of the store and its theme. The focus being moderately priced, casual technical apparel under the Weatherproof® 32° Heat label. The theme of the store revolves around “date night” on Thursdays…more details coming.
9. We know 32 degrees is the freezing mark, but why not “20 below?” How did you come up with the idea of 32 degrees? Given our national and international distribution, temperatures vary widely and we thought 32° would be universally recognized.
10. Describe a typical woman who wears Weatherproof apparel. Everyone from my granddaughter to my wife to my mother-in-law.
11. Describe a typical man. Everyone from my grandson to my son to myself.
12. What Weatherproof coat can you envision Dan Rattiner wearing? Handsome as he is, I can easily see him in one of our 32° Heat casual tech jacket or the one President Obama wore at the Great Wall of China.

Lansing — Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder signed an executive order Tuesday creating a new anti-fraud authority in state government to crack down on abuses in the auto insurance, health insurance and banking sectors.
Legislators have long discussed creating an anti-fraud unit as part of larger plans to reform the state’s no-fault auto insurance system and drive down sky-high rates, but multiple proposals have stalled during Snyder’s tenure.
“Fraud in the system drives up the cost of insurance for all Michiganders, and we need to do everything we can to eradicate it,” the term-limited governor said in a statement.
The executive order, Snyder’s ninth of 2018, tasks director Patrick McPharlin with establishing the anti-fraud unit within the state Department of Insurance and Financial Services.
The authority will function as a criminal justice agency and will investigate “criminal and fraudulent activity” related to any matter the department oversees, including the 1972 auto no-fault insurance law, the state consumer protection act and health care statutes, according to the order.
The executive order gives the authority permission to conduct background checks on licensees, collect and maintain claims of fraudulent activity and criminal investigations, collaborate with law enforcement agencies and coordinate prosecution.
Pete Kuhnmuench, executive director of the Insurance Alliance of Michigan, applauded Snyder’s move but encouraged the Legislature to “enact real reforms to bring down the cost of auto insurance for drivers across the state and fix Michigan’s broken, outdated auto no-fault system.”
Legislative leaders and other officials were not immediately available to comment on Snyder’s action.
McPharlin, in a statement, called Snyder’s order a “positive step forward in addressing the universally recognized problem of fraud in the insurance and financial services sectors.” The unit will “increase our ability to investigate fraud and will ultimately drive down the cost of insurance for Michiganders.”
Snyder called for an insurance fraud authority in his 2013 State of the State address while suggesting broader reforms to the state’s no-fault auto insurance system, which requires motorists to have coverage and provides unlimited lifetime medical benefits.
Legislative reform efforts have repeatedly failed in the state Legislature amid intense lobbying from the powerful insurance, trial lawyer and hospital lobbies.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who pushed a 2017 plan that would have allowed motorists to choose lower-cost plans with less medical coverage but was rejected in the House, sued the state last month in an attempt to force legislative action.

During one particular ‘Naval Investigative Services’ witch-hunt in 1976, one of my commanders commented that if they uncovered and removed all the people in the Navy who were gay, the Navy wouldn’t be able to function. But the climate was severe and it was one of the reasons I finally decided I’d had enough." --Robert Pedrick, Captain (Retired); US Navy, 1961-1985

WATER BOARD STIRS FLOOD OF CONTROVERSY: ALLEGED VIOLATIONS, SECRECY FUEL THREATS OF LEGAL ACTION; SPECIAL MEETING SET MAY 22 TO ADDRESS LEGAL CHALLENGES

A special joint investigative report by East County Magazine and Channel 10 News
10news.com story
By Miriam Raftery
May 19, 2009 (La Mesa)—A water board controversy has sparked public outcry in East County. No, we’re not talking about a torture tactic—though many ratepayers fear pain from steep rate hikes in the Helix Water District. The local “water board” controversy centers around allegations that the Helix Water Board voted on hefty rate-hikes and eliminating irrigation meters for homeowners without adequate public input, possibly violating state law.
Two cure and correct letters (PDF 160 kb) sent to the district allege that the board failed to provide adequate notice of hearings, did not follow proper meeting procedures, appointed an ad-hoc committee after adjourning a public meeting and then reconvened to take action after some citizens had left. The Board has called a special meeting for Friday, May 22 at 10 a.m. specifically to address the legal issues raised.

“This is big-government insanity,” said Gerry Giguere, whose home in rural east county requires a septic system and well.
California will soon impose a new fee of up to $650 for all septic tank owners. The fees would pay for mandatory inspections of all septic tanks and could force many to pay for costly upgrades, angering rural property owners who rely on septic systems.

In response, Democratic leaders staged a “reality check” to unveil a 150-foot long scroll listing $26 billion in budget cuts made since 2003--warning that more severe cuts to schools and other essential programs would be required without the revenue increases in the 2009-2010 budget.
Both sides bolstered their arguments with videos--posted here.

HELIX WATER DISTRICT PROPOSES HEFTY WATER RATE INCREASE
News

New rates start metering May 1, Public Hearing May 27
By Kristin Hobbs Kjaero and Rachel Ford Hutman
The Proposal
(Rachel Ford Hutman)
April 21, 2009 (La Mesa) - If you are one of the 260,000 residents in the
Helix Water District, you may soon be paying a minimum increase of 20% more
for your water—and for some heavy users, several times higher than those with
low water usage.
On March 4 the district’s Board of Directors voted 3-2 to issue a notice of
a public hearing May 27, for rate increases which would increase the base rate
by 20% for the first 10 units of water, plus an additional sliding scale based
on usage. For example, a user of 75 units will have an increase of 49%.

By Miriam Raftery April 18, 2009 (San Diego)—Congressman Bob Filner (R-San Diego) has introduced the “Save Our Border Communities Act, H.R. 670. The bill would require the federal government to reimburse costs for local police, firefighters and other first responders to provide services associated with U.S. ports of entry on the international border. “The federal government has not reimbursed border towns for border-related incidents and the drain on local emergency services is increasingly unbearable,” Filner stated in a newsletter to constituents.

Exploring new ways to keep diabetes at bay

Date: 18 December 2009
Warsaw hospital surgery
A flurry of medical staff is constantly rushing in and out of the surgery at Warsaw's Orlowski hospital, but for a few weeks now it has not just been business as usual for Professor Wieslaw Tarnowski who heads the surgical department. A new surgically implanted device is being tested to help patients control their diabetes, allowing them to live a normal life despite the disease.
"The system we are currently testing has good chances of becoming an important treatment alternative for type 2 diabetes", explains Professor Tarnowski. "It avoids complications that are associated with ordinary diabetes treatment, without forcing the patient to change his or her life completely. If this study proves that the device really works for our patients - which I strongly believe - it will be a kind of revolution."
The study of the novel treatment was made possible with the support of an EIB loan to a consortium of five small and medium-sized enterprises, each engaged in the late stages of developing breakthrough medical devices with a high potential for international commercialisation. Diseases treated in the framework of the Medinvest project range from chronic heart failure and strokes to diabetes and obesity - all conditions that affect a large number of patients globally and entail high health care costs.
A rapidly spreading pandemic
"We expect to see a huge growth in demand for this treatment", says Mateusz Zelewski, sales manager in Europe for the new Tantalus diabetes treatment. In Poland alone around 10% of the population is diagnosed with diabetes and numbers are rapidly increasing. Already now, diabetes treatment tops the national healthcare budget at roughly 8% of total spending. "Europe has to address this issue. We need to find a solution," Zelewski adds.
As one of the most widespread diseases, diabetes remains a worldwide epidemic. In particular, the number of cases of type 2 - obesity related - diabetes has dramatically increased over the years. Type 2 diabetes results from the body's ineffective use of insulin. This type affects 90% of people with diabetes around the world and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. Over time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. Recent figures are nothing short of alarming. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 180 million people worldwide have diabetes and that by 2030 this number will more than double.
Helping patients to go back to normal life
The new treatment currently being studied in is helping to get a grip on the disease and makes it possible for type 2 diabetes patients to avoid an insulin treatment. "Many patients are afraid to use insulin because of the risks involved", explains Professor Tarnowski. The steep fall in blood sugar can have severe effects, just as the heightened level of blood sugar brings many health risks. "Tantalus helps them to go back to a normal life."
The Tantalus system allows type 2 diabetes patients to control their blood sugar level and lose weight at the same time. The medical device is implanted in the patient's gastric system, where it sends electric impulses during meals. The impulses communicate a feeling of satiety to the brain, helping the patient to stop eating sooner and prepare the body to better deal with the subsequent rise in blood sugar.
A new financial structure
Medical technology relies on a combination of leading-edge expertise in engineering and clinical practice, which usually requires a substantial up-front investment in research and development. The medical technology industry is dominated by small and medium-sized companies. These smaller players are facing difficulties to fund the expensive later stages of product development, such as the clinical trials.
The Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) is a direct answer to this challenge. Together with the European Commission, the EIB has launched this joint initiative to support research and development projects and innovation by sharing the underlying risks.
Medinvest is one of the first of such research projects by the Bank involving several EU Member States and Israel to have received funding. In late 2008 the EIB signed up for this innovative project involving high-risks, but also offering high-value added. Its investment of EUR 30m may be relatively small but the EIB's involvement as an anchor investor played an important catalytic role by attracting and retaining other institutional investors to the deal, especially in the midst of a credit crunch.

Public Release: 29-May-2014
Ostracism more damaging than bullying in the workplace
University of British Columbia
Share
Print E-Mail
Being ignored at work is worse for physical and mental well-being than harassment or bullying, says a new study from the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business.
Researchers found that while most consider ostracism less harmful than bullying, feeling excluded is significantly more likely to lead job dissatisfaction, quitting and health problems.
"We've been taught that ignoring someone is socially preferable--if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all," says Sauder Professor Sandra Robinson, who co-authored the study. "But ostracism actually leads people to feel more helpless, like they're not worthy of any attention at all."
The researchers used a series of surveys for their study. First they determined that people consistently rate workplace ostracism as less socially inappropriate, less psychologically harmful and less likely to be prohibited than workplace harassment.
Additional surveys revealed that people who claimed to have experienced ostracism were significantly more likely to report a degraded sense of workplace belonging and commitment, a stronger intention to quit their job, and a larger proportion of health problems.
The researchers also took an employment survey by a Canadian university that included feedback on feelings of workplace isolation and harassment and compared it to turnover rates three years after the survey was conducted and found that people who reported feeling ostracized were significantly more likely to have quit.
"There is a tremendous effort underway to counter bullying in workplaces and schools, which is definitely important. But abuse is not always obvious," says Robinson. "There are many people who feel quietly victimized in their daily lives, and most of our current strategies for dealing with workplace injustice don't give them a voice."
###
Background
The study, Is negative attention better than no attention? The comparative effects of ostracism and harassment at work, is forthcoming in the journal Organization Science and was co-authored by Professor Jane O'Reilly, Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Professor Jennifer Berdahl, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, and Professor Sara Banki, Graduate School of Management and Economics, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran.

Managers Discuss Priorities for Codes, Standards, Regulations
By Chris Matt, Managing Editor - Print & E-Media Facilities Management
OTHER PARTS OF THIS ARTICLEPt. 1: This Page
*Kevin Folsom, director of facilities and plant operations, Dallas Theological Seminary
*Skip Milton, assistant director, facilities operations, Texas Children’s Hospital, Houston
*Mike Gardner, vice president for operations, Butler University, Indianapolis
While regulations, standards, and guidelines have evolved in response to the operations and technology in facilities, one thing has not changed: complying with these guidelines is top of mind for maintenance and engineering managers. Three managers discuss their compliance priorities and offer strategies for professionals new to the industry.
Question: What are your responsibilities related to compliance activities?
FOLSOM: All of them fall under my responsibility — ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), and environmental, for example. We try to proactively deal with those through facility renewal and through planned efforts. Occasionally, the compliance issue comes to us before we have renewal. There’s a balance there that we have to work through. Pressing non-compliance issues are definitely motivators for planning renewal.
MILTON: I initially was in charge of operating the energy-management business unit. We had a change in our management team, and for about a year, I was in charge of the operations business unit, as well as the energy-management business unit. Now, I’m back to having the energy-management business unit. I still have to ensure that I comply with ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) 90 and ASHRAE 62, the Joint Commission, Texas Department of Health Services, and NFPA. Anything I do with respect to change in the environment of the hospital — airflows, air balance, and fluid flows (has to comply).
GARDNER: As vice president for operations, I have not only the facilities piece, but I also have public safety. In terms of how (responsibilities have) changed, I think the Clery Act (a U.S. Department of Education requirement related to campus security and safety) has significantly ramped up in terms of breadth and scope. With respect specifically to the facilities side of things, we, as an independent college of Indiana, entered into an agreement with the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). We are, this fall, going to be going through an EPA peer review toward EPA compliance. Evidently, the EPA is ramping up their audits of higher education, and a legal firm and an environmental-engineering firm out East have done this (agreement) with a number of other groups of schools.
Question: What are your top regulatory priorities?
MILTON: Always Joint Commission, to maintain certification. Texas Children’s Hospital practices continuous service readiness, which means we are in constant readiness for a (Joint Commission) survey. All of the utility systems in the hospital that we maintain are maintained hourly to meet the Joint Commission requirements. We have our inspection reports. We have everything ready. Texas Department of Health Services (is also a high priority). That’s my department’s compliance requirement for infection control, air changes, and pressure relationships between spaces.
GARDNER: I don’t know enough about the new ASHRAE indoor-air-quality codes, but I know that we’re going to be moving into a new science building in our existing science-building renovation. That will be an issue. We have a fairly comprehensive asbestos survey that we continuously update as we renovate. That’s always a priority with any renovation that we have or any time we get into a major building systems repair, whether it be boilers, heating-distribution lines, etc.
FOLSOM: They’re all important. We don’t necessarily question the importance of regulatory priorities. The challenge comes with timing and feathering them into facility renewal so we can get full life-cycle value of a revised component.
Question: What types of regulations and guidelines demand more time and resources to comply?
GARDNER: I think with respect to ADA — this isn’t the right way of saying it — we’ve been a victim of our own success. We’ve paid a lot of attention to ADA compliance, and I think as we get new students interested in Butler University, we have a greater number of individuals with challenges. That has forced us to ramp up our efforts for individuals (such as) blind students. Developing a snow-removal policy, for example, to ensure that blind students have access from their residence halls to the food-service space and then on to classroom buildings from there. We’ve had to change our way of doing business.
FOLSOM: ADA would be the most comprehensive facility-related (activity) on campus because it involves so many other planners and leaders. But a really close second would be environmental as it relates to energy use and recycling because it affects the behaviors of every single person on campus.
MILTON: Everything that Joint Commission requires is absolutely focused on patient care and safety. We do devote a lot of time to compliance, but compliance should be something that we are doing (as part of doing business).
Question: What resources or strategies do you use to keep up on the latest standards and guidelines?
MILTON: I’m a member of ASHE, which is the American Society of Healthcare Engineering. I’m a member of ASHRAE. ASHE is a great source of information. ASHE stays in touch with the Joint Commission. They provide us with information on upcoming changes to the standards. They do a great job of ensuring the information is disseminated accurately to all of their members.
FOLSOM: Well, first you need to understand how the system works. The government relies on private industry — manufacturers, buyers, etc. — and non-profit organizations — NFPA, ASHRAE, etc. — predominantly for codes and standards development. While the government sets the course for big-picture (goals), they’re tapping into manufacturers and buyers to sit on committees to develop and refine these codes and standards. Sitting on a committee is the most effective way to stay on the cutting edge. However, the committee members are required to pay for all their own travel and time to participate, which can be very costly and time-consuming.
GARDNER: On the maintenance and operations side of things, our safety committee does a really good job of keeping in touch with things. We also have an environmental health and safety office within public safety that monitors and manages (new developments).
Question: What is the role of maintenance and engineering staff in complying with regulations and standards?
FOLSOM: They’re typically on the whip’s end. By the time a new or updated code comes to them, all the momentum cannot be stopped. They simply have to deal with it and try to help their leadership understand why they need to spend time and money to comply.
MILTON: They perform the inspections, and they perform the maintenance. The documentation is developed by them. That documentation is codified and maintained on record for anyone to see. We have all maintenance records on all pieces of equipment going years back, particularly generators. We have a 96-hour requirement to have emergency power for the hospital in case of an event. So we diligently test generators, fire pumps and all the safety systems.
GARDNER: In our maintenance shops, we have to maintain OSHA (Occupational Health and Safety Administration) compliance, and they do a good job of worker safety within the safety-committee programs that we have. We have confined spaces that we have annual training on. We have blood-borne pathogens that we have annual training on.
Question: For managers new to the industry or to a position, what first steps should they take related to compliance?
GARDNER: A good conversation with the human resources office to know what’s out there (is important). From a building construction and maintenance standpoint, I think a good meeting with an architecture and/or engineering firm to know what the issues are (is important). Architects and engineers by definition have to stay on top of ADA, building codes, NFPA, National Electric Code, etc. For a person who’s new in facilities management, they don’t necessarily have to know everything (related to compliance), but they need to have a good understanding of what those compliance issues are and how they impact day-to-day operations of a large facility.
MILTON: You always have to comply with your authority having jurisdiction, whether it’s the building-inspection department, the fire marshal or whoever that (authority) may be. That’s the ultimate authority that you have to maintain compliance with. Wherever you are located — and it depends on the business you’re in — you have to find out who you need to comply with.
FOLSOM: Spend time reading all those free publications, and align with an association that most closely aligns with your type of industry.

Chia Se Vietnam Sweden Poverty Alleviation Program, Phase II
Chia se could be described as a pre-reform program aimed at showing a way to implement the decentralization policies of the Government nationwide, analyze the results obtained and communicate lessons learned to the public administration nation-wide. It also tried to influence all relevant Government entities towards applying a rights-based approach to poverty reduction.
The Chia sẻ approach to poverty alleviation can be briefly described as a way of empowering villagers to jointly manage a Local Development Fund (LDF), large enough to support investments that can improve the living conditions of the poor in a sustainable manner. Identification of poor households as well as setting development priorities were tasks decided by the village meeting convened by officials elected by the village. To maintain a democratic and transparent process for managing the LDF, investment decisions were taken by the village meeting.
Village investments covered a wide variety of sectors: Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock, Environment, Water and sanitation, Business development, Market development, Branding, Capacity building, Health, Education, Rural infrastructure, Roads, Aquaculture, Small scale industry, Agro-processing, Gender rights, Farmers organizations, Climate change mitigation, Social security and Social welfare, Vocational training, Farmer training, Irrigation, Electrification, Information, etc.
The positive outcome from Chia sẻ phase 1 motivated Government of Vietnam to solicit support for a second phase. Within the framework of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, the Public Administrative Reform and in particular National and Local planning through Socio Economic Development planning (SEDP) , the second phase has as its main target to develop ways of making the decentralized, rights-based methodology replicable Nation-wide. The third phase:
Consolidated the results achieved in the local areas
Developed and analyzed less expensive ways of successfully applying the same approach, making it replicable nation-wide
Made the results and the procedures behind these results well-known and communicated, for obtaining impact on Socio Economic Development planning, policy-making and application of already existing policies within the fields of poverty reduction, rural development, decentralization and grassroots democracy, thereby becoming part of the approach utilized by the public administration for these tasks at different levels.
Directly contributed to integrating the rights-based methods into the application of (1) the new rural policy framework named Tam Nong and its National Targeted Program, (2) provincial guidelines and decisions on a more decentralized, participatory SEDP planning, and (3) Nationally approved guidelines for participatory SEDP planning at commune level
The design of the Program was innovative and in 2012 and 2013 it continues without donor support and be based on Government of Vietnam resources only both on Province and National level.
ORGUT provided technical assistance and advice to the Ministry of Planning and Investments and the Provincial Peoples Committees in Ha Giang and Quang Tri in particular in developing and promoting the decentralized, rights-based approach to local governance. Specific fields covered were institution building, capacity building, result-based approach, result capture and M&E, strategic communication, high level policy analysis, strategy development, strategic environmental assessments, socio-economic analysis, production of information material, operations and maintenance and quality assurance.

DeSantis pins hopes on GOP turnout Tuesday

ORLANDO — In his final push in the campaign for governor, former Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis told supporters on Monday that he can win the race if the GOP dominates election-day voting.
“I think if Republicans vote and vote in big numbers on Tuesday, we will win all of these races,” he said at a rally outside the Freedom Pharmacy on the east side of Orlando.
He was joined by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., state Rep. Matt Caldwell, the Republican candidate for agriculture commissioner, and Ashley Moody, a former judge who is the GOP nominee for attorney general.
DeSantis told reporters that he is entering election day “roughly at parity” with Democrat Andrew Gillum after the early voting period, which gave the Democrats a slight edge based on calculations through Monday.
But DeSantis, who stepped down from his Northeast Florida congressional seat in September, said “a lot of our super voters have yet to vote,” referring to loyal Republicans who have voted in the last three or four elections.
“We just have a lot of our voters who want to vote on election day. That’s just the way they are. We’re definitely going to win election day, so I’m looking forward to that,” DeSantis said.
Rubio sounded a similar theme in his remarks.
“This sounds like an oxymoron, but hear me out. This election is going to be decided on election day, not just by the counting of the (votes) but by who votes,” Rubio said. “I know a lot of people are waiting until tomorrow. But we have to make sure they vote.”
Another theme struck by DeSantis and his supporters on Monday was an appeal to Hispanic voters. His rally was held in Orange County, which has the third largest bloc of GOP Hispanic voters in the state, although its 28,000 voters are overshadowed by 275,000 Hispanic Republicans in Miami-Dade County.
DeSantis said his economic message of low taxes and limited government will appeal to many voters, including Hispanics, in contrast to his Democratic opponent, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who wants to raise corporate income taxes by $1 billion to pay for teacher raises.
DeSantis called Gillum a “committed leftist ideologue.”
“That’s just who he is. If he gets in there, Florida’ trajectory is going to change dramatically. I don’t think we want to stop our economic momentum,” DeSantis said.
Rep. Jeanette Nunez, a Miami Republican who is running for lieutenant governor with DeSantis, slammed Gillum for Tallahassee’s crime rate, which is above the state average based on population.
“We understand that a good economy is important, but if your communities are not safe, all of that is for naught. That is something our opponent has a terrible track record in,” Nunez said. “If he can’t keep the city of Tallahassee safe, he can’t keep the citizens of the state of Florida safe.”
The Orlando rally was one of five campaign stops scheduled for DeSantis on Monday, with similar appearances in Jacksonville, Vero Beach, Pinellas County and Fort Walton Beach.
He was joined at two of the rallies by Lara Trump, a daughter-in-law of President Donald Trump. The president himself held two campaign rallies in support of DeSantis in the last week, including a Saturday night event in Pensacola.
DeSantis used Trump’s backing to make the case that if he is elected, the state will be in a better position to receive support from Washington, D.C., in contrast to Gillum who has called for the impeachment of the president.
“You should have a governor who can work constructively with the administration in Washington to make sure Florida is getting what it needs,” DeSantis said.
DeSantis along with his wife, Casey DeSantis, a Jacksonville television personality, will vote Tuesday morning in Ponte Vedra Beach. They will watch the election results at a campaign party Tuesday night in Orlando.

Dover moves forward with consulting services for well study
Friday
Sep 28, 2012 at 3:15 AM Sep 28, 2012 at 5:35 AM
By MICHELLE KINGSTONmkingston@fosters.com
DOVER — The City Council voted unanimously Wednesday night to move forward with consulting services for the Griffin and Ireland Well study.
The well is slightly contaminated at this time, but is still meeting standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA may be tightening its standards, however, and if they do, the Griffin Well may not pass.
The study that was approved Wednesday will help identify where contamination is coming from so it can be taken care of and the well can continue to be used to produce safe, high-quality water to the city.
The study will show the most cost effective way to continue to supply a significantly large amount of high-quality water to Dover, a city continuing to show an increase in population.
The well, located off Mast Road, was shut down from November 1995 through January 1999 due to groundwater contamination originating at the former Madbury Metals, Inc. facility, according to a city budget statement.
Since its reopening in 1999, it supplies 21 percent of the city's water, producing 720,000 gallons of water each day.

How to Sidestep the S&P 500's Weak Spots

It is not just enough to be invested in the markets to grow an investor&apos;s portfolio. It is also important to reduce exposure to certain areas in a changing market environment.
Continue Reading Below
Investors may consider an ex-sector stock exchange traded fund strategy in the current environment to exclude exposure to underperforming areas and participate in broad market growth.
Most investors turn to beta index-based ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEArca: SPY), to fill out their core stock portfolio position. However, the broad approach may expose investors to underperforming segments of the market. For instance, among its top sector allocations, the S&P 500 Index includes a hefty 20.4% position in information technology and 13.7% in health care, two segments that have been relatively flat over the past month as other sectors rallied on the Donald Trump victory.
Alternatively, investors can remove these weak areas and still participate in the S&P 500 through ex-sector ETFs like the S&P 500 Ex-Health Care ETF (NYSEArca: SPXV) and the S&P 500 Ex-Technology ETF (NYSEArca: SPXT).
"An investment in the S&P 500 that excludes a particular sector gives you the flexibility to tailor your core U.S. equity exposure," according to ProShares. "It can replace a traditional S&P 500 fund, allowing you to underweight or even eliminate a sector in your portfolio."

Like their names imply, SPXV excludes health care exposure and SPXT excludes tech companies. Potential investors, though, should be aware that since the funds purposely exclude exposure to some of the largest S&P 500 market sectors, the ETFs portfolios allocations will overweight other large market segments in their place.
SPXV includes a larger 24.9% tilt toward tech, 15.0% financials, 14.7% consumer discretionary, 11.6% consumer staples and 11.4% industrials. SPXT tracks 19.3% health care, 16.8% financials, 16.5% consumer discretionary and 13.0% consumer staples.
Something like SPXT may be a way for investors to still maintain broad market exposure but reduce exposure to a weakening outlook in the tech segment as investors rotate out of the growth style and a stronger U.S. dollar weighs on multi-national company&apos;s overseas revenue streams.
The ex-sector ETFs may also act as a type of sector rotation strategy as health care and technology stocks were previously outperforming areas of the market and have now been replaced by the currently outperforming financials and energy segments.
In previous periods, investors would have turned to the S&P 500 Ex-Energy ETF (NYSEArca: SPXE), which provides exposure to S&P 500 companies with the exception of those included in the Energy Sector, and the S&P 500 Ex-Financial ETF (NYSEArca: SPXN), which tracks the same S&P 500 group sans financial stocks.
Potential investors, though, should be aware that these ETFs are still rather small, so utilize limit orders to take better control over trades.

One Of Sophie Monk's Final Four Bachelors Is Technically Still Married To Someone Else
Bit awkward to bring up right before the final week.
By Mat Whitehead
Network Ten
We're down to the final four bachelors in one of the most exciting seasons of 'The Bachelorette' with Sophie making arguably the most shocking, and somewhat baffling decisions.
Network Ten
Sophie's final four: Jarrod, Blake, Stu and Apollo (mid workout).
Jarrod, Stu, Blake and Apollo are the only ones who remain in the race to win Sophie's heart. Final four?More like final bore if you know what we mean. Haha, nailed that one. A classic zinger.
It's time for hometown visits!
First up we went to Jarrod's vineyard. Jarrod has a vineyard and he loves growing things. He loves growing vines, he loves growing love plants and he loves growing redder and redder as he stares intensely into the eyes of any competition.
"I adore Jarrod, and I love wine," Sophie says with her priorities completely intact.
Network Ten
Sophie looking immensely comfortable as she and Stu arrive for dinner.
Jarrod's mum immediately took him away to have a quiet chat in the kitchen -- which looked like it was directly next to the living area. There she pointed out that Jarrod had jumped into falling for Sophie quite quickly. "YES," everyone watching at home said. "YES," Sophie quietly said from the other room.
They had some grilled fish for dinner but that wasn't the only thing getting grilled around the dinner table! (Nailed it.) Jarrod's mum took her "downstairs for a bit of a chat" into the wine cellar/basement where Sophie was full of regrets (but her regrets were mainly that she didn't bring a bag to fill with wine).
Network Ten
"Before we talk about Jarrod, I'm just after a light Pinot Noir, somewhere in the $14-14.50 range? Do you do goon bags?"
After his family all gave Soph the approval, Jarrod admitted that he had fallen in love with her. It was a super sweet moment for ol' J-bird and it seemed like Sophie really appreciated his candour.
Next up was Apollo, who was excited to get away from the glitz, the glamour and the candles of the Bach mansion. He genuinely said he was excited to get away from the candles, for once that wasn't something we made up.
Apollo brought Sophie to meet some of his loved ones, his tiny horses. Surprise! Apollo owns an variety of different sized horses! Some of the horses looked like they had escaped from 'Sesame Street', some of the horses looked normal but no two horses were the same.
After some horse whispering that included absolutely no whispering whatsoever (you just wag your finger at a horse to make it reverse?! Horse magic!), Apollo took Sophie off to meet his human family and two friends.
Network Ten
Before she answered the awkward questions Sophie gave the party a taste of her famous Dr. Evil impression.
"How are you with polygraph tests?" Apollo's friend Scott asked as they sat down to dinner, "because I have a polygraph in the car," he mentioned casually in the same way a normal person would ask if anyone wanted their drink refilled.
The best part of the dinner was when Apollo's grandma pretended like Sophie wasn't even in the room and just talked a lot of sense. Grandma told Apollo to be careful and protect himself in this, a very unique situation, which was actually great advice. She also called Apollo the best looking of the bunch which makes us think the magician's grandma is a psychic.
Network Ten
Grandma for Bachelorette 2018.
Next up was Stu who was excited to be bringing a girl home for the first time in over 40 years. "The first time I met Stu I thought he was a big douche," Sophie said. She then said something about misjudging him but we couldn't hear her over the cries of "US TOO," heard around the nation.
Stu's story seems to have changed from originally just showing up to pick Sophie and her friends up off an island to now having tried to ask her out on his boat. Anyway he got his chance to take her on a boat ride because he's a literal millionaire.
"I'm very laid back, very relaxed," Stu said as the pair chilled out on the front of his luxury boat in Sydney's harbour. "I really love this little cove here," Stu said right outside the f**king Opera House.
Network Ten
"Look at all the dumb people going about their days, having to go to their 'jobs' lol."
As they dined on a seafood platter and fine wines on his luxurious boat, Stu decided to reveal to Sophie that he had a vasectomy. "I've... you know.... I did.... After I had.... Do you get it???" he tried to hint. It was like the worst game of Pictionary ever.
FOX / Network Ten
"C'mon Luanne you know what this is..."
If that wasn't enough Stu then dropped the bomb that, even though he's been separated for four years, he's still ~technically~ married. You know, just a tiny little snafu.
Then he was like "Okay, let's go meet my relatives," just for added fun!
"I get humour, we have a very similar thing in my family," Sophie said as she mingled with Stu's family members.
Sophie began talking about how difficult it is to find authenticity in dates and it was all pretty much the same conversation. "I'm getting questions like it's a tennis match, it's two against one" Sophie said apparently not knowing the rules to tennis.
The final hometown visit was with Blake. We quietly forgot Blake was even still here because he absolutely has no chance of making it any further. Sorry we're just being realistic.
Blake took Sophie ice skating which at first was such a snooze but then he clapped his hands and a snow machine started!!! Apollo isn't the only magician in the house! Blake is an ice witch!
It was actually super cute. It even made us momentarily forget our irrational fears of ice skates basically being gigantic knives at the bottom of shoes.
Network Ten
This isn't the only cold reception Blake's gonna get tonight.
As Blake brought Sophie to meet his family it all immediately became clear: Blake has never been here to find love. Jarrod was right. He has, for this entire time, been on the show as a way for his mum to meet Sophie Monk. And for that, we applaud him.
Blake's mum was stoked to meet Sophie, until it came time for the grilling. Blake decided he didn't want to get involved because... well... mmm... We have no idea. So he basically threw Sophie to the wolves as his family asked her a series of increasingly intense questions.
Blake was super pumped with his decision to barely speak during the hometown visit, meanwhile Sophie was less than impressed.
Network Ten
Dissed before he was dismissed.
Obviously at the rose ceremony Blake didn't receive a rose, and absolutely no one except Blake was shocked.
As Sophie tried to let him down gently Blake basically threw up his hands, completely blindsided. "The best guy for her is in this limo," he said. "Me...?" The camera guy replied. "No, sorry-" Blake replied. "Oh, you meant me?" the limo driver chimed in. "Hang on- no I meant," "Oh, you meant me..." the producer in the car probably said.
"Guys I meant me! I am the best boy! I am a good and beautiful boy!" Blake cried as the car pulled away from the mansion.
The one correct thing Blake did say was that there are only "the second-best guys left in the house now". After James' departure we couldn't agree more.
Network Ten
Just in case you needed a new phone background.
We miss you Jimmy.

Tiger Woods DATELINE VIDEO: Jamie Jungers INTERVIEW, Las Vegas And More (VIDEO)
***SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO***
"Dateline NBC" ran a feature on Tiger Woods tonight, focusing on his infidelity and his time in Las Vegas. The show centered on two of Woods' alleged mistresses, Rachel Uchitel and Jamie Jungers, as well as the golfer's alleged behavior in Las Vegas.
Norm Clarke, a gossip columnist at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said that "when Tiger came to town, it was often to hook up with Michael Jordan and [NBA Hall of Famer Charles] Barkley." Together, they would be joined by a "large number of very beautiful women." Astonishingly, Woods allegedly developed a voracious gambling appetite, so much so that he reportedly had a $1-million limit. "I was hearing a lot of stories about how quickly he went from a $100 player to a $10,000 player," Clarke said.
Another source, whom "Dateline" identified as "Alissa" to protect her identity, revealed information about alleged mistress Rachel Uchitel. "I believe she felt they were both in love," she said of Uchitel's relationship with Woods.
Later in the show, "Dateline" aired an interview with Jamie Jungers, a Las Vegas woman who claims to have had a prolonged affair with Woods. She spoke with the "Today" show earlier in the day, and much of what she said on "Dateline" was similar to her earlier interview.
The alleged mistress confirmed her feelings for Woods, saying, "I was in love with him." Jungers also rejected any claims that she was involved with an escort service or prostitution. "I have nothing to do with prostitution. Never have, never will," she emphatically responded.
Jungers did, however, go into some detail about her sex with Woods. "He was pretty wild. It wasn't like boring, married-couple sex," she said, echoing previous comments made to the Sun about the "wild" and "crazy" sex she and Woods allegedly enjoyed together.
Jungers also provided photographs taken inside Woods' California home, but "Dateline" could not confirm their authenticity.

Asked if she owed Woods' wife an apology, Jungers declined. "No," she said, "I don't. I feel like that's his business. I was younger, and I'm not saying that what I did then was right, but I'm certainly not going to say that it was wrong."
Below, see photos of some of the people interviewed on "Dateline."

Penn program poised to prepare mid-career professionals for presidencies

Penn’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions (CMSI) and CIEE: Council on International Educational Exchange host presidents of Minority Serving Institutions at CIEE’s 2015 Annual Conference in Berlin, Germany.
The University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions (CMSI) has embarked on yet another noble mission to impact people of color in higher education. Late last year, the repository for minority serving higher education institutions announced the creation of a pathway to presidency program for aspiring leaders, “MSI Aspiring Leaders Forum and Mentorship Program.”
“We are excited to train and provide mentoring to the next generation of MSI leaders,” stated Dr. Marybeth Gasman, founding director of CMSI and professor of higher education at the renowned Ivy League institution. “The mentors we have on board from across the country exemplify 21st century leadership skills and innovation, which is exactly what the nation’s MSIs need.”
Courtesy of $745,000 in grants from the ECMC and Kresge Foundations, the MSI Aspiring Leaders will prepare the next generation of MSI presidents. The program includes both a leadership forum and mentorship program and has been designed to help promote diversity among higher education leadership.
“ECMC Foundation supports the MSI Aspiring Leaders forum and mentorship program because it will enable MSI leaders to coach, mentor, and transfer knowledge and skills to the next generation of leaders,” said Sarah Kirschenbaum, program director, College Success at ECMC Foundation. “The program plays an important role in enabling future leaders to implement tools and techniques that improve college success among underserved students.”

By providing professional development workshops focused on 21st-century skills, as well as two years of post-forum mentorship, MSI Aspiring Leaders intends to cultivate future MSI presidents by strengthening pathways to leadership and building connections between peers with similar aspirations and abilities.
“The leaders at Minority Serving Institutions are some of the most innovative and dedicated educators in the nation—they have to be because they're at institutions that educate students who are historically underserved,” said Gasman.
Kresge’s Education Program deputy director, Caroline Altman Smith, echoed Gasman’s sentiment. “Kresge is proud to help launch this Forum because we want to see a stronger pipeline of leaders of color in higher education,” she said.

Currently, close to 60% of sitting university presidents are over the age of 60. According to a 2016 TIAA Institute study, college and university faculties have become slightly more diverse in the last 20 years. Most gains for underrepresented minority groups have been on the non-tenure track.
In 2015, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that full-time faculty members at American colleges and universities remain heavily white, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. Seventy-eight percent of full-time faculty members — and 84 percent of full professors — were white in 2013. Whites are even more over-represented among college leaders, according to data from the American Council on Education. Eighty-seven percent of presidents, and 88 percent of those recently hired, are white.
“Leading a university is a challenging job, and that can be especially true at Minority Serving Institutions,” said Altman Smith. “Given how many presidents will be retiring in the current years, and how important minority-serving institutions are to the nation’s college completion agenda, we believed it was critical to invest in the professional development of those who will lead MSIs in the next decade and beyond.”
The Penn Center for Minority Serving Institutions brings together researchers and practitioners from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Asian American, Native American, and Pacific Islander Serving Institutions. Part of Penn’s Graduate School of Education, CMSI’s goals include: elevating the educational contributions of MSIs; ensuring that they are a part of national conversations; bringing awareness to the vital role MSIs play in the nation’s economic development; increasing the rigorous scholarship of MSIs; connecting MSIs’ academic and administrative leadership to promote reform initiatives; and strengthening efforts to close educational achievement gaps among disadvantaged communities.
“In the next four years, we will be in the process of completing the mentoring for the second cohort of this program,” stated CMSI’s associate director for programs, Paola “Lola” Esmieu. “By this point in time we will have worked with 60 aspiring leaders. In eight years, we hope that the aspiring leaders will have maintained their trajectory and will be either in the process of actively pursing presidential posts at MSIs or are beginning the process.”
To apply to participate in the MSI Aspiring Leaders program, online applications must be completed and submitted no later than May 30 at 11:59 p.m. EST. The MSI Aspiring Leaders Forum will take place in November at the University of Pennsylvania. Program fees will be waived for invited MSI Aspiring Leaders. Contact Paola “Lola” Esmieu, at pesmieu@gse.upenn.edu, for more details.

Man Trapped In Snow For 5 Days Says He Survived On Taco Sauce Packets
“Taco Bell Fire Sauce saves lives," Jeremy Taylor said after he and his dog were rescued from their SUV.
By Nina Golgowski

An Oregon man may have a good argument for not cleaning out your car.
Jeremy Taylor told authorities that he and his dog survived by eating packets of taco sauce as they were trapped by snow in his vehicle for five days.
The 36-year-old, who goes offroading in the area, said he drove up west of the resort community of Sunriver with his dog, Ally, when his SUV became stuck in snow last Sunday, the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office said.
He spent the night in his vehicle and attempted to walk for help on Monday, but had difficulty because of the amount of snow that had fallen, authorities said.
Deschutes County Sheriff's Office
An Oregon man and his dog were rescued after their SUV became stuck in snow for nearly five days.
“Jeremy stayed warm over the next four days by periodically starting his vehicle and used a few taco sauce packets he had as food,” the sheriff’s department said on Facebook. In an earlier post, they said that he wasn’t believed to have had a phone on him.
It wasn’t until Friday afternoon that a snowmobile rider spotted his car and called 911. Taylor and his dog were described as hungry but otherwise in good condition.
In a Facebook post on Saturday, Taylor described himself as “lucky,” adding: “Lets never do that again.”
Asked by a Facebook friend about the hot sauce packets, Taylor responded: “Taco Bell Fire Sauce saves lives.”
Authorities recommend drivers in cold weather climes carry a winter car survival kit with them that includes non-perishable food, water, blankets and a basic toolkit and first aid kit. A full list of the items can be found here.
If a driver becomes trapped in snow, it’s advised that the car’s motor is run for just 10 minutes every hour to provide warmth while preserving fuel. If the vehicle is covered or surrounded by snow, first ensure that the exhaust pipe is not blocked before turning on the vehicle so that carbon monoxide doesn’t enter.

NASA's First All-Female Spacewalk Will Happen During Women's History Month
Astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch, along with flight controller Jackie Kagey, are set to conduct the International Space Station spacewalk on March 29.
By Alanna Vagianos
NASA plans to conduct its first all-female spacewalk later in March during Women’s History Month.
The International Space Station spacewalk, part of Expedition 59, is scheduled for March 29, and will include astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch, as well as Jackie Kagey as the lead EVA, or spacewalk, flight controller, NASA told HuffPost on Wednesday. The spacewalk will last around seven hours, according to NASA’s website.
“The March 29 spacewalk will be the first with only women,” NASA spokeswoman Kathryn Hambleton said, hedging that “assignments and schedules could always change.”
“It was not orchestrated to be this way; these spacewalks were originally scheduled to take place in the fall,” Hambleton added.

— Anne McClain (@AstroAnnimal) March 4, 2019
The on-the-ground flight control team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston will include lead flight director Mary Lawrence and NASA engineer Kristen Facciol.
Facciol tweeted her excitement last week, writing, “I just found out that I’ll be on console providing support for the FIRST ALL FEMALE SPACEWALK with @AstroAnnimal and @Astro_Christina and I can not contain my excitement!!!!”
Spacewalks are somewhat rare and are usually done for reasons that include exterior work on a spacecraft or satellite, or testing new equipment.
McClain is currently on the International Space Station as part of Expedition 58. Koch is set to leave Earth on March 14 to join Expeditions 59 and 60. McClain, Koch and Kagey are all from the 2013 astronaut class, which NASA told HuffPost was 50-percent women.

BREXIT and A Very Special US-UK Relationship

On June 23, 2016 the British people, in a sovereign state called the United Kingdom (consisting of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), voted in a national referendum to decide whether they should remain in the European Union (EU).
They voted to LEAVE.
What should Americans care?
President Trump does.
He just said, “The withdrawal agreement “sounds like a great deal for the EU and by that he meant the UK might not be able to trade with the US.
Watch the video here:
Sovereignty can be defined in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies.
It is clearly not our choice what the UK does, but we want the best for them and the British people.
President Obama, you might remember, spent a few days in London with Prime Minister Cameron lobbying and campaigning hard for the Remain vote.
Picture this: a foreign leader intervenes in a sovereign decision of another state. How would Americans feel if some other distant world leader, say, Emmanuel Macron or Robert Mugabe, came here to tell us what to do?
Really.
Obama said Britain would “go to the back of the queue” (line, in British parlance) in US interests if they did not vote to stay in Europe.
He trotted out every argument in the book also suggesting his globalist TTIP trade negotiations with Europe would be damaged, if the vote went to Leave.
Now honestly there are reasons for and against BREXIT and the forces were about equally split. The vote came down to 52% Leave and 48% Remain.
One side won — which is what happens in a political referendum.
One side, using figures from HM Treasury, (albeit a government agency) suggested it would cost Brits jobs, economic growth and about $4000 per head by 2030, if they vote to leave Europe. The calculations have been questioned and the models seem a slight bit dire. It was called, "Project Fear.”
They lost even though Prime Minister May was a Remainer.
The euro-skeptics, on the other hand, said nonsense, that the cost of leaving is slight and the benefits of independence and a secure immigration policy outweigh the pro-European position.
They said the bureaucracy and budgetary costs (estimated at the equivalent of $500 million a week) of staying in Europe — were far too expensive.
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU’s most expensive policy, accounts for 40 per cent of the EU budget—raising consumer prices by protecting inefficiency.
They also calculated that the EU prevents the UK from other open trade, costing the UK about 4 percent of GDP to the economy.
Further, for them, the euro zone crisis demonstrates what happens when ill-matched economies enter into a monetary union. Greece, among other countries, has witnessed severe consequences.
Two years ago few people thought the Brits would actually leave Europe; but today, after a rise in populism worldwide and growing nationalist sentiment, it is a foregone conclusion. And many more people have come to the conclusion that the country is better off untied from Brussels and its undemocratic and bureaucratic ways.
The idea that the Anglo-Saxons are Continentals has itself long been contested (since at least 1066) and European identity, let alone the flawed integrationist machinery of the Brussels experiment, is roundly questioned; well, detested might be closer to the prevailing view — even in other parts of Europe.
The elite that dominates EU decision-making is social democratic, managerial, bureaucratic, and socialist with a view to higher taxation and redistribution of wealth.
But from an American perspective should we truly care?
Do we really have a dog in this fight?
Former London Mayor, the ever colorful, Boris Johnson, who wants himself badly to be the next Prime Minister, said that, the Obama position was “ridiculous “and that his views on the subject reflect a “part-Kenyan heritage”… “driving him toward anti-British sentiment.”
He has called Prime Minister May’s latest deal with Brussels, negotiating withdrawal from the EU, nothing short of a making Britain into a “Vassal State.”
Nigel Farge, the ex-leader of the nationalist UKIP party, went further and told Obama to, “butt out.”
More recently he has decried Mays’ deal as “the worst deal ever.”
The question US citizens should puzzle is this: would they want the United States to join anything like the EU—a federal superstate that curtails sovereignty?
Reread the definition provided and you decide.
Of course the answer is, NO.
We wouldn’t want that in any way, shape or form.
And the British already, under Margaret Thatcher, decided not to become part of the flawed Euro currency and the European Central Bank. They have a kind of halfway house. In — but not all the way — in. And Europe, make no mistake, wants a complete political union as its end game.
They have done everything to force unfavorable terms on the UK in their long negotiations.
So here’s an interesting and novel alternative no pundit is yet suggesting and I say it only half facetiously.
If our Very Special Relationship partners (forgetting the War of Independence as a spat between cousins, as well as their torching of the White House in 1812) don’t want to be Europeans (the island apart argument and Churchill’s notion of the English speaking peoples) — why not give them two other viable alternative choices?
The United Kingdom could join our newfound agreement with Canada and Mexico and we would rename it the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. Nothing to sneeze at and no costs attached, just a bigger free trade zone. No superstate attached.
Or, more radically, and I jest not (well, maybe), give the UK 51st statehood status and a proportional number of members of Congress with two Senators.
That would make our relationship truly special.
Hell, throw in an NFL franchise for London, too. We like the Queen, so she could have some honorific role. How about Queen of Queens?
British culture, food, and sport would all dramatically improve and together we would win all the Olympic medals.
Ha… something to consider?
Seriously, we all should recall a profound speech given by then former Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in 1946, at Westminster College, in Fulton, Missouri.
It was perhaps his most significant post-war speech, where he launched both the phrases, iron curtain“ and “special relationship “ into popular currency.
He said the two countries shared a common history, a common language, and a common literature and that in the course of the twentieth century we’d twice been on the same side in wars to defeat tyranny and dictatorship and for liberty and freedom.
Our mutual and abiding interests, common worldview, congruence of sympathies, and the undeniably unique heritage of the Anglo-American tradition of LIBERTY is our true future together.
With a shared Whig history, the King James Bible, the Anglican Church, long historical memory — all of these things make up a valuable Anglo-Atlanticist patrimony.
Britain belongs there, not in Europe.
The twenty-first century will much need such Anglo-American leadership more than ever before. Perhaps, herein lie the sinews of lasting peace.

Synopsis
Azhwars are the foremost devotees of Lord Vishnu. They begot the name Azhwars as they were immersed in true devotion towards the Lord.The 12 azhwars are the true guide to unflinching devotion. Boothathazhwar, Poigaiazhwar and Peyazhwar are called the Mudazhwars. Thirumazhisai azhwar, Tirumangai, Periyazhwar, Kulasekara, Nammazhwar, Madurakavi, Tondaradipodi, Tirupanazhwar are the rest. Andal is the only female amongst the 12 azhwars. Each of these azhwars belonged to a different caste thus proving to the world that caste is no barrier to devotion. Their hymns- the Nalayira Divyaprabhandam (4000 in number) are soaked in pure love and bliss. Their stories along with a few of their hymns with apt songs are presented in these 2 DVDs by Smt. Vishakha Hari. May we enjoy this eternal experience.
Smt. Vishakha Hari is a practioner of the ancient beautiful form of art called Harikatha or Katha keerthan. Herein she weaves beautiful stories of value and wisdom interspersed with mellifluous songs of yesteryear great composers. Her themes are varied and are generally from our great epicsand puranas like the Ramayan and Srimad Bhagavath. She presents Harikathas in Tamil and English (the narrative is in Tamil or English) and the songs are from various languages including Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Hindi and Sanskrit. Her Gurus are Shri Lalgudi G.Jayaraman, the great violin maestro for music, Shri Krishnapremi Swamigal and Shri R. Hariji (her husband) for katha (story component). In this pack of 2 DVDs she is ably supported by violin vidwan Shri Ananthakrishnan, Shri Arjun Ganesh on the mrudangam, Shri Trichy Murali on the ghatam. Kruthi Bhat and Keerthana Bhat who are also students of the Lalgudi school provide beautiful vocal harmony enriching and enlivening the harikatha.

The Guardian: When it comes to water access we keep doing the same thing. And failing
Ajay Paul, thematic ​coordinator for the sustainable services initiative at Welthungerhilfe
“…[T]oo many water and sanitation services in developing countries are still unreliable, sub-standard, and need major repairs after three to five years. … We falsely attribute the breakdown of a pump to poor government policies, corrupt local officials, or weak management by the water-user committee. So we put ourselves in opposition to the government, we ignore policies, and we do not work with local government officials. We run our projects in parallel to theirs, and we do not link up to or support local government plans. When the project is finished, we hand over the management of the pump to the water-user committee and walk away. But we haven’t worked with the local government, so it has no incentive to support the local community when the pump breaks down. … We know that achieving [Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6)] — clean water and sanitation for all by 2030 — will require monitoring, reporting, and greater transparency about failures and success after projects are over…” (4/7).

JEFFERSON CITY — Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed a senate resolution Friday that would block a wage increase for at-home health care attendants.
That resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 46, would disapprove a rule proposed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services that would set a new pay range for these attendants. At-home attendants care for elderly and physically disabled Missourians and are paid with funds from Medicaid.
The Missouri House of Representatives rejected the wage increase rule earlier in February.
The current minimum wage is $7.65 per hour. The wage increase rule would establish a new range from $8.50 to $10.15 per hour.
"Missouri's home-care workers help our seniors and Missourians with disabilities live healthier and more independent lives - and they deserve a raise for the difficult and important work they do," Nixon said in a statement released Friday. "By disapproving this rule, the General Assembly defies the will of voters and denies these personal care attendants a much-deserved incerease in their wages."
In a letter to the General Assembly, Nixon stated that SCR 46 would frustrate implementation of the Quality Home Care Act, which was passed by a wide margin in November 2008. The act created a bargaining process for personal care attendant wages.

File photo: For 30 years, Carl Kasell was an unflappable anchor of that digest, bringing a no-frills seriousness to unfolding history, from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.	
By The Washington Post |
PUBLISHED: April 17, 2018 at 2:23 pm | UPDATED: April 18, 2018 at 3:51 am
By Adam Bernstein | Washington Post
Carl Kasell, a radio personality who brought gravitas and goofiness to the airwaves, first as a staid newsreader on NPR’s “Morning Edition” and later as the comic foil and scorekeeper on the delightfully silly news quiz show “Wait Wait . . . Don’t Tell Me!,” died April 17 at an assisted-living center in Potomac, Maryland. He was 84.
The cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, said his wife, Mary Ann Foster.
We offer email newsletters for news, sports, entertainment and much more.
Check out the full list here and sign up!.
Kasell’s voice, resonant and reassuring, with a lilting trace of his North Carolina tobacco country heritage, helped define NPR as an emerging force in news broadcasting. He joined the public radio network in 1975 and, four years later, helped inaugurate “Morning Edition,” writing and reading five-minute top-of-the-hour news updates from pre-dawn to the lunch hour.
For 30 years, he was an unflappable anchor of that digest, bringing a no-frills seriousness to unfolding history, from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. His skill was conveying the drama of the news while maintaining an unforced conversational delivery, what an NPR executive once described as the warm voice of an informed companion.
He parlayed that stolid reputation into unexpected laughs when he signed on for “Wait Wait” in 1998. He became the semi-straight man to host Peter Sagal, becoming public radio’s institutional voice in playful harmony with a Chicago-based actor, writer and all-around wiseacre who declared his intent to run a weekly show that boasted the motto “NPR without the dignity.”
Some NPR executives initially fretted that Kasell’s participation on a program that lampooned the news and public radio tropes would collide with the venerable anchor’s normally sedate on-air reputation.
But as Sagal once told The Washington Post, “Deep inside that serious newscaster persona was a huge piece of cured North Carolina ham.” (An amateur magician, Kasell once sawed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg in half.)
“Wait Wait” executive producer Doug Berman, known to credit-attuned listeners by his moniker, “The Subway Fugitive,” had been trying to cast the show when he heard Kasell field questions at a public radio conference. A woman asked what time Kasell woke to do his job.
“1:05 a.m.” the newscaster replied.
Someone bit. “Why 1:05?”
“Because 1 is too damn early.”
The quip showcased the possibilities, in Berman’s view, of pairing Kasell as a dry-witted second banana to the first “Wait Wait” host, the short-lived Dan Coffey, and then to Sagal. “I like to say they brought me into the show to add dignity,” Kasell deadpanned to the Wall Street Journal. “I’ve brought dignity, stability and class.”
In a recent interview for this obituary, Sagal called Kasell pivotal to the show’s fortunes, saying his credibility as the “voice of NPR, the brand as a voice, made us sound like we were an actual NPR show.”
Sagal said that Kasell struggled earnestly to re-create celebrity voices on the show, including newsmakers such as Britney Spears and Monica Lewinsky, but he was not any good at it. “He was in on the joke,” Sagal said. “You could laugh at him, and he’d love it.”
The show has become one of the network’s most popular and enduring staples, fetching millions of listeners on Saturday mornings. It features a panel of humorists and journalists vying on behalf of listeners for Kasell’s voice to be played on their outgoing voice-mail message — “a prize that’s invaluable and worthless at the same time,” Berman told the Wall Street Journal.
One of the recurring games, “Who’s Carl This Time?,” featured Kasell impersonating newsmakers as varied as O.J. Simpson, President George W. Bush and Keith Richards. For a quiz called the “Listener Limerick Challenge,” he read doggerel that tested call-in contestants on their knowledge of the week’s news.
For “Not My Job,” he prodded guests such as writer Salman Rushdie to answer questions distinctly outside their area of expertise – in his case, Pez dispensers. At various times, he was called on to warble less-than-definitive covers of Tom Jones’s “What’s New, Pussycat?,” Peggy Lee’s “Fever” and the “Macarena.”
“I’m not a mimic,” he told the Chicago Tribune, saying he was merely following a tradition set by George Fenneman, Groucho Marx’s sidekick on the radio and 1950s TV quiz show “You Bet Your Life.” “I try my best and sometimes, often times, it fails. But I’m told there’s a certain charm about it that people like.”
Carl Ray Kasell (pronounced “castle”) was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on April 2, 1934, and was one of four children. His father, he once told a reporter, “was a guy who kind of bounced from job to job,” with little money to show for it. Radio, with comedians such as Jack Benny and serials such as “The Lone Ranger,” became his source of entertainment and escape.
As a child, he hosted a “music show” on his grandmother’s windup Victrola – reciting fake commercials between the 78s – and also played practical jokes using the family radio. “Before I even started to school,” he told NPR, “I sometimes would hide behind the radio, which would be sitting on a table, and pretend that I was on the air and try to fool people who came by to listen.”
He won many lead roles in high school drama productions. Future TV star Andy Griffith, who had moved back to North Carolina to teach and hone his nightclub act, once played Sir Walter Raleigh to Kasell’s Indian chief in a summer stage production and encouraged the young man to pursue a career in theater. “I told him, ‘No, I’m going to be a radio star,’ ” Kasell told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Kasell studied English and helped start a radio station with fellow student Charles Kuralt, who became a CBS newsman celebrated for his folksy “On the Road” segments. Kasell, in the Class of 1956, left the university shortly before graduation to fulfill Army service.
After his discharge, he jobbed around as a disc jockey and newscaster at commercial stations in North Carolina and Virginia, including WAVA-FM in Northern Virginia, before joining NPR. His “Morning Edition” schedule was not necessarily conducive to family life, but he stole hours of sleep in the afternoon before watching his son’s Little League practice and then returned to bed in time to wake at 1 – or 1:05.
His first wife, the former Clara de Zorzi, died in 1997 after 37 years of marriage. In 2003, he married Mary Ann Foster. Besides his wife, of Washington, survivors include a son from his first marriage, Joe Kasell of Ashburn, Virginia; a stepson, Brian Foster of Washington; a sister; and four grandchildren.
Kasell, a longtime announcer for the annual Kennedy Center Honors broadcast on CBS, was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2010 and spent many years as NPR’s “roving ambassador.” He inspired merchandise – a Carl Kasell plush toy doll, in the form of an old man wearing a suit and holding a radio microphone.
He stepped down from “Wait Wait” in 2014, sparking tributes from President Barack Obama (“Barack, from Washington, D.C.”), actor Tom Hanks and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Bill Kurtis, the announcer and news anchor known for his stentorian voice, succeeded Kasell, who that same year published a memoir, “Wait Wait . . . I’m Not Done Yet!”

Kasell estimated that on “Wait Wait” he put his voice on more than 2,000 answering machines. He was game for all kinds of requests, up to a point. He once declined an offer that he felt sounded too much like an advertisement for a business. But he was open to singing “Oklahoma!,” the disco hit “I’m Your Boogie Man” and the Meow Mix cat food jingle. He also custom-tailored limericks if winners preferred his poetry to his balladry.
On his home machine, it was his wife’s voice greeting callers. “I’m a psychotherapist,” she said recently, “and I would have loved to have had his voice, but I didn’t want to get too cute.”

New fact sheet highlights dangers of climate change in wake of hottest July on record
September 01, 2016
LANSING – Today, the Michigan Climate Action Network released a fact sheet detailing the impacts of climate change on Michigan’s recreational industry and natural resources. July was the hottest month on record globally, which raises concerns over how climate change impacts Michigan ahead of one of the most popular weekends for outdoor recreation.
“This summer’s record-breaking temperatures should sound an alarm for anyone preparing to enjoy outdoor activities this Labor Day Weekend,” said Kate Madigan, director of the Michigan Climate Action Network. “The impacts of climate change are becoming more pronounced each year, and we should be concerned about how rising temperatures will continue to affect Michigan’s Great Lakes, wildlife and outdoor recreation industry.”
“We can protect Michigan’s outdoor heritage … but only if we act now to cut carbon pollution, invest in clean energy, and make communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.” – Mike Shriberg, Great Lakes Regional Executive Director for NWF
Key facts include:
✓ July had the highest average global temperature of any month since record keeping began in 1880.
✓ Temperatures are projected to continue rising at a rate of seven to 12 times faster in the next 40 years.
✓ Since 1991, rainfall has been 30 percent higher than the 1901-1960 average, resulting in more frequent flooding and runoff pollution of waterways.
The fact sheet also cites research by the National Audubon Society finding that more than half of the bird species it studied were in danger of becoming endangered or threatened this century because of climate impacts.
“Many bird species’ ranges are expected to shift northward with a changing climate. Some of our most iconic birds, like bald eagles and common loons, may no longer be able to find suitable habitat in Michigan,” said Rachelle Roake, Conservation Science Coordinator for the Michigan Audubon Society. “Action taken now to reduce emissions and preserve habitat can protect our birds and other wildlife.”
Climate change is also impacting fish, and recreational fishing, which is a nearly $2 billion industry in Michigan. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) report Swimming Upstream: Freshwater Fish in a Warming World documents how climate change is warming our lakes, rivers and streams, and harming iconic species like trout and walleye.
“Warming waters are already causing big problems for fish that rely on cold, clean water,” saidMike Shriberg, Great Lakes Regional Executive Director for NWF. “We can protect Michigan’s outdoor heritage and prized fishing streams, but only if we act now to cut carbon pollution, invest in clean energy, and make communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change.”
This Labor Day weekend, thousands of Michigan families will spend time in the great outdoors enjoying Michigan’s natural resources. Climate change-related incidents like extreme weather events and record-breaking temperatures raise questions over the future of Michigan’s outdoor recreation and tourism economy. A clean energy future with more renewable energy like wind and solar can reduce dangerous pollution and mitigate the effects of climate change.

TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
The Mueller report might not say it, but David Corn will. So amid the swirling headlines and cable chatter, David provides a clear and honest assessment of what we really know about Trump's actions: “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia's Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”
Even though Mueller may be done with his investigation, Mother Jones is not. David and his team in Washington have been digging deep on the Russian connections and other corruption scandals since before the 2016 election, and we're not stopping now. If you agree there's more to dig into and expose, please help our team do it with a tax-deductible donation today.

The Top 10 Israeli Terror Companies You Need To Boycott

The terrorist state of Israel launched an all out military attack on the 8th of July 2014 against the innocent, defenceless Palestinian civilians, living on the Gaza strip. This fueled outrage worldwide, and the international community called for increased Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) on all Israeli products and on all organisations funding the state of Israel. Due to this Israel was forced to stop the attack, which it did so only after Gaza was destroyed with a huge death toll of over 2200.
Though the conflict was brought to a halt, Israel continues its aggression upon the Palestinian people. More and more Palestinian land is being illegally taken over, and there is no end in sight for the torture and terror they endure. Hence it is up to us, the everyday Muslims of this world, to stand up for our downtrodden brethren. We must continue the boycott and do it with greater intensity. This is a list of the Top 10 Israeli Terror Companies to Boycott, through which we can make a positive difference in the lives of the Palestinian people.
GE
McDonalds
Coca-Cola
Kraft
HP
Starbucks
Intel
Motorola
Kimberly-Clark
Nestle
It is an obligation upon all of us, Muslim or not, in the name of humanity, to Boycott all companies that support the terrorist state of Israel. The only reasonable excuse for not boycotting, is insufficient evidence to show the link between Israel and these companies. That is easily rectified by this video, which has ample proof to show the strong connections between Israeli war crimes and the evil corporations that sponsor them.

Undocumented Immigrant Says He Worked at Property Co-Owned by Trump Sons

In this June 30, 2018, file photo, people protest President Donald Trump's administration's immigration and refugee policies in Los Angeles, California.
An undocumented immigrant said he was a caretaker at a shooting range co-owned by President Donald Trump’s eldest sons and that he worked without authorization at one of the president’s golf courses before he lost both jobs this year.
The caretaker — Juan Quintero, 42 — told NBC News he worked at the Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley in Hopewell Junction, New York, from the year 2000 until he lost his job in January, when the Trump properties took action to purge its employees who were working illegally. He said he also worked at the Leather Hill Preserve hunting range in Wingdale, co-owned by Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and others, from 2016 until this year.
The Trump Organization did not respond to NBC News' requests for comment.
In a previous statement, Eric Trump — who, along with Donald Trump Jr., took over management of their father’s businesses — said the Trump Organization has “very strict” hiring practices for its “tens of thousands of employees.”

These states have the worst emergency response times
Posted: 1:27 PM, Jun 15, 2016
Updated: 2016-06-15 18:29:11Z
By: Tessa Boyce
In a health emergency, timing is crucial. Minutes ticking by can literally mean life or death. Recently, HBO's John Oliver critiqued the lackadaisical 911 response in the U.S., stating, "Ubers can find you better than ambulances can. Depending on where you live, [911 dispatchers] may also be underfunded, understaffed and full of outdated technology — which is fine, if you're describing a Radio Shack."
But what happens at the next step, when we arrive at the hospital in an ambulance or on our own? Many people still face a painfully long wait before they are seen by a physician or properly diagnosed. HealthGrove , a health data site that's part of Graphiq , wanted to find out which states have the slowest emergency department response. Using data collected from a Medicare survey of more than 4,000 hospitals, HealthGrove found the 10 states with the slowest emergency response times based their Timeliness Score. The Timeliness Score is a comprehensive score out of 100, based on the following metrics:
Patient's total arrival to departure time at the hospital
Average time patient spends in the emergency department before they are seen by a healthcare professional
Average time patient spends in the emergency department, after the doctor decides to admit them as an inpatient, before leaving the emergency department for their inpatient room
Average time patient spends in the emergency department, before they are admitted to the hospital as an inpatient
Average time patients who come to the emergency department with broken bones wait before receiving pain medication
Percentage of patients who leave the ER without being seen
Percentage of patients with stroke symptoms who receive brain scan results within 45 minutes of arrival
The hospital with the patient's longest arrival to departure time is also highlighted in each state. Many hospitals with a slow emergency response are teaching hospitals associated with state universities, but there are a few private hospitals where patients find themselves spending two to three hours in waiting room purgatory.
While highly populated states like New York or California exhibit long emergency wait times on average, hospitals in small states with dense populations have the slowest response times of all. In one state, patients with broken bones have to wait an average of an hour and ten minutes before receiving pain medication. In an emergency, we cannot be too picky with our hospitals, but in many cases a long wait can aggravate the problem.

Svalbard’s Snow Crabs: a Pincered Proxy for Arctic Oil
The Barents Sea snow crab has prompted an intense bout of legal bickering between the European Union, Norway, the U.S. and Russia. The real dispute, according to Hakai Magazine, may be about a different commodity: oil.

In the Barents Sea, the snow crab is a relatively new arrival. First recorded in 1996, the invasive species has since spawned a valuable fishery – one that could soon eclipse Norway’s famous cod fishery. The Barents Sea snow crab has also sparked an intense bout of legal bickering, with the European Union and countries from Norway to the United States to Russia fighting over access to the crabs.
But this fight is about much more than the crabs. In fact, the real dispute may be about a different commodity: oil.
The Arctic archipelago of Svalbard – the northernmost permanently populated place on earth – was discovered by Dutch explorers at the end of the 16th century. Whales and walrus were plentiful, and unrestricted hunting soon began. After the inevitable exhaustion of those stocks, international interest in Svalbard waned until the late 19th century, when the discovery of rich coal seams ignited interest in mining the islands and conflicts over its legal status.
In 1920, a treaty signed in Paris between Norway, the U.S., Great Britain, India, France, Italy, Denmark and a number of other countries gave Norway “full and absolute sovereignty” over Svalbard. However, one of the terms of the treaty was that all signatory nations would be entitled to “enjoy equally” the rights to the resources in Svalbard and its territorial waters.
But the treaty does not detail who owns the rights to the seabed – including access to oil, gas, minerals and, yes, ocean floor creatures such as the snow crab. Norway argues that it alone owns these rights. Most other countries disagree, claiming that all signatories hold the right to enjoy them equally, as with terrestrial and nearshore resources.
For years, this was a legal debate relegated to trading barbs through crabby notes verbales and ministerial sound bites. But all that changed on January 16, when the crew of the Latvian fishing vessel Senator was arrested by the Norwegian coast guard for illegally fishing snow crabs in the disputed waters off Svalbard.
A month prior to the incident – which saw the vessel and its crew of 30 instructed by the Norwegian coast guard to set course to Kirkenes, mainland Norway – the E.U. had authorized 16 vessels to fish snow crabs on the disputed seabed around Svalbard. One of these licenses went to the Senator. It was a license the Norwegians are clearly unwilling to recognize.
Harald Sakarias Brøvig Hansen, a fisheries researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the ownership of Svalbard continental shelf resources is such a sensitive issue that the Norwegian government had been “sitting quiet, and hoping that nothing would really happen.” With the Senator incident, that is no longer possible. “This won’t pass by itself,” Hansen says.
How this incident will eventually be resolved is anyone’s guess.
Iván López, the chairman of the European Union’s Long Distance Advisory Council, an industry- and NGO-representative body that advises the E.U. on long-distance fishing, says the Senator episode is a turning point.
Both the E.U. and Norway “will think it is a [sign of] aggression, and will have to react,” says López.
As to whether the potential of oil, gas, and mineral resources in the area is underwriting the whole dispute, both López and Hansen have no doubt. “It is completely to do with that,” López says. “Yes, oil and gas is also an issue here,” Hansen adds.
Rachel Tiller, a research scientist at SINTEF Ocean, a Norwegian think tank, specializes in studying potential conflict scenarios in Svalbard. She says the parties involved will likely avoid the courts, as it would be both too expensive and too risky: “One side will definitely end up losing,” she says.
Instead, Tiller says negotiations will be the course of action: It has been reported that Norway has offered the E.U. access to Svalbard snow crabs in exchange for receiving increased access to fish quotas in E.U. member state waters. If the E.U. – yet to respond to any such offer – is to hold true to its position, it will say that Norway does not have the right to use snow crabs as bargaining chips.
As for the Senator, the crew was released and, over two months after its arrest, the vessel was at last permitted to set sail again from Kirkenes. The shipowner was fined more than $150,000. A meager amount in the context of the crab wars? Only time will tell.

How Arctic Communities Respond to Climate Change

Where Millennials Come From
And why we insist on blaming them for it.
By Jia Tolentino
A generation has inherited a world without being able to live in it.

Imagine, as I often do, that our world were to end tomorrow, and that alien researchers many years in the future were tasked with reconstructing the demise of civilization from the news. If they persevered past the coverage of our President, they would soon identify the curious figure of the millennial as a suspect. A composite image would emerge, of a twitchy and phone-addicted pest who eats away at beloved American institutions the way boll weevils feed on crops. Millennials, according to recent headlines, are killing hotels, department stores, chain restaurants, the car industry, the diamond industry, the napkin industry, homeownership, marriage, doorbells, motorcycles, fabric softener, hotel-loyalty programs, casinos, Goldman Sachs, serendipity, and the McDonald’s McWrap.
The idea that millennials are capriciously wrecking the landscape of American consumption grants quite a bit of power to a group that is still on the younger side. Born in the nineteen-eighties and nineties, millennials are now in their twenties and thirties. But the popular image of this generation—given its name, in 1987, by William Strauss and Neil Howe—has long been connected with the notion of disruptive self-interest. Over the past decade, that connection has been codified by Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University, who writes about those younger than herself with an air of pragmatic evenhandedness and an undercurrent of moral alarm. (An article adapted from her most recent book, “iGen,” about the cohort after millennials, was published in the September issue of The Atlantic with the headline “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?” It went viral.) In 2006, Twenge published “Generation Me: Why Today’s Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before.” The book’s cover emblazoned the title across a bare midriff, a flamboyant illustration of millennial self-importance, sandwiched between a navel piercing and a pair of low-rise jeans.
According to Twenge, millennials are “tolerant, confident, open-minded, and ambitious, but also disengaged, narcissistic, distrustful, and anxious.” She presents a barrage of statistics in support of this assessment, along with anecdotal testimonials and pop-cultural examples that neatly confirm the trends she identifies. (A revised edition, published in 2014, mentions the HBO show “Girls” six times.) Twenge acknowledges that the generation has come of age inside an “economic squeeze created by underemployment and rising costs,” but she mostly explains millennial traits in terms of culture and choice. Parents overemphasized self-esteem and happiness, while kids took their cues from an era of diversity initiatives, decentralized authority, online avatars, and reality TV. As a result, millennials have become irresponsible and fundamentally maladjusted. They “believe that every job will be fulfilling and then can’t even find a boring one.” They must lower their expectations and dim their glittering self-images in order to become functional adults.
This argument has a conservative appeal, given its focus on the individual rather than on the structures and the conditions that govern one’s life. Twenge wonders, “Is the upswing in minority kids’ self-esteem an unmitigated good?” and then observes, “Raising children’s self-esteem is not going to solve the problems of poverty and crime.” It’s possible to reach such moralizing conclusions even if one begins with the opposite economic premise. In “The Vanishing American Adult,” published in May, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, insists that we live in a time of generalized “affluenza,” in which “much of our stress now flows not from deprivation but, oddly, from surplus.” Millennials have “far too few problems,” he argues. Sasse chastises parents for allowing their kids to succumb to the character-eroding temptations of contemporary abundance and offers suggestions for turning the school-age generation into the sort of hardworking, financially independent grownups that the millennials have yet to become.
The image of millennials has darkened since Strauss and Howe walked the beat: in their 2000 book, “Millennials Rising,” they claimed that the members of this surging generation were uniquely earnest, industrious, and positive. But the decline in that reputation is hardly surprising. Since the nineteen-sixties, most generational analysis has revolved around the groundbreaking idea that young people are selfish. Twenge’s term for millennials merely flips an older one, the “me generation,” inspired by a 1976 New York cover story by Tom Wolfe about the baby boomers. (The voluble Wolfe, born in 1930, is a member of the silent generation.) Wolfe argued that three decades of postwar economic growth had produced a mania for “remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing one’s very self . . . and observing, studying, and doting on it.” The fear of growing selfishness has, in the forty years since, only increased.
That fear is grounded in concrete changes: the story of American self-interest is a continuous one that nonetheless contains major institutional and economic shifts. Adapting to those shifts does tend to produce certain effects. I was born smack in the middle of the standard millennial range, and Twenge’s description of my generation’s personality strikes me as broadly accurate. Lately, millennial dreams tend less toward global fame and more toward affordable health insurance, but she is correct that my cohort has grown up under the influence of novel and powerful incentives to focus on the self. If for the baby boomers self-actualization was a conscious project, and if for Gen X—born in the sixties and seventies—it was a mandate to be undermined, then for millennials it’s more like an atmospheric condition: inescapable, ordinary, and, perhaps, increasingly toxic. A generation has inherited a world without being able to live in it. How did that happen? And why do so many people insist on blaming them for it?
“K ids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials,” by Malcolm Harris (Little, Brown), is the first major accounting of the millennial generation written by someone who belongs to it. Harris is twenty-eight—the book’s cover announces his birth year next to a sardonic illustration of elementary-school stickers—and he has already rounded the bases of young, literary, leftist media: he is a writer and editor for the online magazine the New Inquiry; he has written for Jacobin and n+1. He got his first taste of notoriety during Occupy Wall Street: shortly after activists settled in at Zuccotti Park, he wrote a blog post for Jacobin in which he claimed to have “heard unconfirmed reports that Radiohead is planning a concert at the occupation this week.” He set up an e-mail account using the name of the band’s manager and wrote to Occupy organizers, conveying the band’s interest in performing. Later, in a piece for Gawker titled “I’m the Jerk Who Pranked Occupy Wall Street,” he explained that his goal was to get more people to the protest, and expressed disdain for the way the organizers responded. (Fooled by his e-mail, they held a press conference and confirmed the band’s plan to appear.)
Harris’s anatomizing of his peers begins with the star stickers that, along with grade-school participation trophies, so fascinate Sasse, Twenge, and other writers of generational trend pieces. “You suck, you still get a trophy” is how Twenge puts it, describing contemporary K through five as an endless awards ceremony. Harris, on the other hand, regards elementary school as a capitalist boot camp, in which children perform unpaid labor, learn the importance of year-over-year growth through standardized testing, and get accustomed to constant, quantified, increasingly efficient work. The two descriptions are not as far apart as one might think: assuring kids that they’re super special—and telling them, as Sasse does, that they have a duty to improve themselves through constant enrichment—is a good way to get them to cleave to a culture of around-the-clock labor. And conditioning them to seek rewards in the form of positive feedback—stars and trophies, hearts and likes—is a great way to get them used to performing that labor for free.
My memories of childhood—in a suburban neighborhood in west Houston that felt newly hatched, as open as farmland—are different, breezy and hot and sunlit. I attended, mostly on scholarship, a Southern Baptist school attached to one of the largest megachurches in America, and elementary school seemed like the natural price of admission for friends, birthday parties, and long summers full of shrieking, unsupervised play. (The very young aren’t much for picking up on indoctrination techniques; the religious agitprop felt natural enough, too.) But some kind of training did kick in around the time I entered high school, when I began spending fourteen-hour days on campus with the understanding that I needed to earn a scholarship to a good college. College, of course, is where the millennial lounges around on lush green quads, spends someone else’s money, insists on “safe spaces,” protests her school’s heteronormative core curriculum, and wages war on her professors if she receives a grade below an A. I did the first two of those things, thanks to the Jefferson Scholars Foundation at the University of Virginia. I also took six classes a semester, worked part time, and crammed my schedule with clubs and committees—in between naps on the quad and beers with friends on my porch couch and long meditative sessions figuring out what kind of a person I was going to be.
Most undergraduates don’t have such a luxurious and debt-free experience. The majority of American college students never live on campus; around a third go to community college. The type of millennial that much of the media flocks to—white, rich, thoughtlessly entitled—is largely unrepresentative of what is, in fact, a diverse and often downwardly mobile group. (Millennials are the first generation to have just a fifty-fifty chance of being financially better off than their parents.) Many millennials grew up poor, went to crummy schools, and have been shuttled toward for-profit colleges and minimum-wage jobs, if not the prison system. (For-profit colleges, which disproportionately serve low-income students, account for roughly a tenth of undergraduates, and more than a third of student-loan defaults.) Average student debt has doubled just within this generation, surging from around eighteen thousand dollars at graduation for the class of 2003 to thirty-seven thousand for the class of 2016. (Under the tax plan recently passed by House Republicans, the situation worsens for student borrowers and their families: that bill eliminates the deduction on student-loan interest and voids the income-tax exemption for tuition benefits.)
A young college graduate, having faithfully followed the American path of hard work and achievement, might now find herself in a position akin to a homeowner with negative equity: in possession of an asset that is worth much less than what she owes. In these conditions, the concept of self-interest starts to splinter. For young people, I suspect, the idea of specialness looks like a reward but mostly functions as punishment, bestowing on us the idea that there is no good way of existing other than constantly generating returns.
Harris and I were born in the same year, and we were in college when the financial crisis hit, in 2008. As I approached graduation, I watched news footage of crumple-faced families carrying boxes out of foreclosed houses, followed by shots of expensively dressed professionals walking to work at their bailed-out banks. I joined the Peace Corps, and was assigned to Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after I returned to the U.S., in 2011, the grungy, amorphous Occupy movement started blooming; protesters were railing against the impunity of “the one per cent” in Houston, as they were in dozens of other cities across the country. Suspended in the amber of my temporary underemployment, I spent long afternoons hanging around Hermann Square, downtown, making small talk with libertarian lawyers, pan-activists in bandannas and hiking sandals, and a lot of people in my own demographic—millennials coming into their political discontent.
That September, Occupy set up its makeshift camp in lower Manhattan. On the first day of October, some seven hundred demonstrators were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct as they walked on the roadway of the Brooklyn Bridge, blocking traffic. Harris was one of them. He argued, along with many others, that the police had led the group onto the bridge and then arrested them. In 2012, as the case was going forward, his Twitter archive was subpoenaed. Twitter resisted the order, but eventually provided the tweets, which made it clear that Harris had heard the police warning protesters to stay off the roadway. (“They tried to stop us,” he’d tweeted.) He was sentenced to six days of community service. These Occupy stories don’t make it into “Kids These Days”—Harris leaves out his personal experience altogether, keen to focus on structural analysis rather than anecdote. He does observe, though, in a discussion of social media, that “Coke tastes good even once you’ve seen what it can do to a rusty nail.” He continues to make frequent use of Twitter.
When Twenge first published “Generation Me,” social media had not yet become ubiquitous. Facebook was limited to colleges and high schools, Twitter hadn’t formally launched, and Instagram didn’t exist. But the millennial narrative was already taking its mature shape, and social media fit into it seamlessly: the narcissism of status updates, the shallow skimming of shiny surfaces, the inability to sit still. One might therefore conclude that the story of generational self-centeredness is so flexible as to have no real definition—it can cover anything, with a little stretching. But there is another possibility: that social media feeds on the same conditions that have made millennials what they are.
“Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services,” the Times Magazine noted in October. Anxiety, Harris argues, isn’t just an unfortunate by-product of an era when wages are low and job security is scarce. It’s useful: a constant state of adrenalized agitation can make it hard to stop working and encourage you to think of other aspects of your life—health, leisure, online interaction—as work. Social media provides both an immediate release for that anxiety and a replenishment of it, so that users keep coming back. Many jobs of the sort that allow millennials to make sudden leaps into financial safety—in tech, sports, music, film, “influencing,” and, occasionally, journalism—are identity-based and mercurial, with the biggest payoffs and opportunities going to those who have developed an online following. What’s more, cultivating a “personal brand” has become a matter of prudence as well as ambition: there is a powerful incentive to be publicly likable at a time when strangers routinely rate and review one another over minor transactions—cat-sitting, assembling IKEA furniture, sharing a car ride or a spare bedroom—and people are forced to crowdsource money for their medical bills.
Young people have curled around their economic situation “like vines on a trellis,” as Harris puts it. And, when humans learn to think of themselves as assets competing in an unpredictable and punishing market, then millennials—in all their anxious, twitchy, phone-addicted glory—are exactly what you should expect. The disdain that so many people feel for Harris’s and my generation reflects an unease about the forces of deregulation, globalization, and technological acceleration that are transforming everyone’s lives. (It does not seem coincidental that young people would be criticized for being entitled at a time when people are being stripped of their entitlements.) Millennials, in other words, have adjusted too well to the world they grew up in; their perfect synchronization with economic and cultural disruption has been mistaken for the source of the disruption itself.
This idea runs parallel, in some ways, to the assessments of Twenge and Sasse and other conservative commentators. But Harris’s conclusions are precisely the opposite of theirs: instead of accommodating the situation even further, he argues, kids should revolt. “Either we continue the trends we’ve been given and enact the bad future, or we refuse it and cut the knot of trend lines that defines our collectivity. We become fascists or revolutionaries, one or the other.” It’s a near-apocalyptic vision. But the polarization that permeates American politics—stemming, in part, from a sense that extreme measures are necessary to render our world livable—is especially evident among millennials, some disaffected portion of whom form much of the racist alt-right, while a larger swath has adopted the leftist politics shared by Harris. In the 2016 Presidential primaries, Bernie Sanders won more young votes than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined.
“The newfound popularity of socialism among millennials is an alarming trend,” Sasse writes in “The Vanishing American Adult.” He provides a syllabus that he hopes will steer people away from such thinking, and toward an intellectually mature adulthood, and he dutifully includes “The Communist Manifesto,” so that his hypothetical pupils can properly grasp how wrong it is. It seems more likely that a young person who opened “The Communist Manifesto” tomorrow would underline the part about personal worth being reduced to exchange value and go off to join the Democratic Socialists of America, which has grown fivefold in the last year. One of its members, a Marine Corps veteran named Lee Carter, was elected to Virginia’s House of Delegates in November. He was born in 1987. “Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism,” the critic and theorist Fredric Jameson wrote, fourteen years ago. These days, the kids find it easy enough to imagine both. ♦

Student Loan Cancellation, Deferment & Forbearance
Which Is Better If I Can’t Pay My Student Loans: Deferment or Forbearance?
If you’re eligible, a deferment is a better option than a forbearance. You might also consider other options.
By Amy Loftsgordon, Attorney
Getting a deferment of your federal student loans is a better option than a forbearance—if you’re eligible. The government picks up the tab for interest on subsidized loans during a deferment period, which makes this option cheaper for most people. With a forbearance, interest accrues.
If you’re having trouble making your federal student loan payments, you might also consider changing your repayment plan, finding out if you qualify for loan cancellation, or taking out a Direct Consolidation Loan.
Deferring Your Student Loans
A deferment excuses you from making student loan payments for a set period of time because of a specific condition in your life—like returning to school, economic hardship, or unemployment. Interest will not accrue on subsidized loans during the deferment period.
Subsidized loans compared to unsubsidized loans. Students get subsidized loans based on need, and these loans do not accrue interest while students are still in school or during a deferment. An unsubsidized loan, however, accrues interest from the time it’s dispersed.
Qualifying for deferment. You can defer repayment of a federal student loan if:
you meet specific criteria and conditions for your type of loan, and
you are not more than 270 days behind (in "default") in loan payments.
Most common types of deferments. You might be eligible for a deferment on your federal student loans if you're:
enrolled in school at least half-time
enrolled in an approved graduate fellowship program
a parent who received a Direct PLUS Loan or a FFEL PLUS Loan, and the student for whom you obtained the loan is enrolled at least half-time at an eligible college or career school (and for an additional six months after the student ceases to be enrolled at least half-time)
unemployed and seeking employment
suffering economic hardship
serving in the military on active duty in connection with a war, military operation, or national emergency (or served within the past 13 months)
disabled and in a rehabilitation program
receiving treatment for cancer (and for six months thereafter), or
serving in the Peace Corps.
(To learn more who can qualify for a deferment, see What's the Difference Between Student Loan Forbearance and Deferment?)
How to get a deferment. Contact your loan servicer to apply for a deferment.
Getting a Forbearance
In a forbearance, you stop making payments (or make smaller payments) for a set period of time.
Interest continues to accrue during a forbearance. When you don’t pay the interest on a loan, the servicer generally capitalizes it—that is, the interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan. (Though, unpaid interest isn’t capitalized on Perkins Loans, according to the Department of Education.) So, the total amount you’ll have repay over the life of your loan will usually be higher.
Qualifying for a forbearance. Forbearance on federal student loans may be granted for a number of reasons, including:
financial problems
medical expenses
a change in your employment, or
another reason that's acceptable to your loan servicer.
In some situations, your loan servicer decides whether to grant your request for a forbearance. But in others—like if you’re serving in an AmeriCorps position for which you received a national service award or performing teaching service that would qualify you for teacher loan forgiveness (Direct Loans and FFEL Program loans only)—forbearance is mandatory. (To learn more who can qualify for a forbearance, again, see What's the Difference Between Student Loan Forbearance and Deferment?)
How to get a forbearance. To apply for a forbearance, contact your loan servicer, explain your situation, ask for a forbearance, and fill out the appropriate forms. If you're in default, you can't get a forbearance.
Paying the interest during the forbearance period. If you don’t qualify for a deferment, you could choose to pay the interest as it accrues during a forbearance period to keep the loan from ballooning once your forbearance ends. However, if you’re trying to pay down other higher interest debt, this might not make sense. For example, suppose Sammy Student owes $10,000 at 5% on a federal student loan and $10,000 at 18% on a credit card. In this situation, it makes more sense to first pay down the credit card debt because of the high interest rate. (To get an idea about which debts you should pay before others, see Which of My Debts Should I Repay?)
It also doesn’t make sense to pay the interest if you’re working towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) because the interest that’s tacked on to the principal will be forgiven once the loan is forgiven. (While student loan forgiveness is sometimes taxable, student loan amounts forgiven under PSLF are not considered income for tax purposes according to the Department of Education.)
Other Options: Changing Repayment Plans, Loan Cancellation, Consolidation
In addition to considering deferment and forbearance, it’s a good idea to think about changing your repayment plan, looking into whether you can cancel your loans, and considering a Direct Consolidation Loan.
Change your repayment plans. If you’re having trouble making your student loan payments, you might also consider the different repayment plans that the Department of Education offer for federal student loans. For more information, see Student Loan Repayment Plans and How to Choose a Student Loan Repayment Plan.
Find out if you qualify for cancellation. Under certain limited circumstances, you might be able to cancel your student loans, which means you don’t have to pay them. Getting your student loans cancelled isn’t easy; you'll have to meet specific conditions depending on the type of loan you have. (To learn more about cancellation options for federal student loans, see Student Loan Relief: Canceling Your Loans.)
Consider consolidating your loans. If you have multiple student loans, you might be able to lower your monthly payment with a Direct Consolidation Loan. A Direct Consolidation Loan allows you to combine all your federal student loans into one loan for one monthly payment. (Learn more about federal Direct Consolidation loans, see Student Loan Consolidation: Federal Student Loans, Private Student Loans.)

Russia
Transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia
Russia ▸ Facts ▸ Comments ▸ News ▸ Videos
Russia, officially the Russian Federation, is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and North Asia. At 17,125,200 square kilometres (6,612,100 sq mi), Russia is by far or by a considerable margin the largest country in the world by area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with about 146.77 million people as of 2019, including Crimea. About 77% of the population live in the western, European part of the country. Russia's capital, Moscow, is the largest metropolitan area in Europe proper and one of the largest cities in the world; other major cities include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait. However, Russia recognises two more countries that border it, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are internationally recognized as parts of Georgia.

Drafting in the developing countries (II): Dimitris Papadimoulis MEP
If the EU wants to succeed in its efforts to battle global wamring, it must work harder to bring China on board.
European Voice
By	Dimitris Papadimoulis	
11/26/08, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 4:56 PM CET
The first round of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change ends in 2012 and a new global deal must be struck in Copenhagen in 2009. Next month in Poznan´, environment and climate change ministers will try to ham-mer out a draft for the Copenhagen sum-mit, which, I hope, will include specific goals for reducing emissions and adapting to the adverse effects of climate change.
The future regime should be equitable, based on historical responsibility and according to the principle of “common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities”.
As far as China is concerned, its position is not a secret. Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, at a conference in Beijing recently, clearly stated that “China is keen to reduce its own emissions and to contribute to a global deal to tackle climate change”, but Beijing’s co-operation “is conditional on financial and clean technology transfer from developed countries”.
The EU should expect of China that it plays a more active role in fighting global warming. If China gets more involved in international co-operation and co-ordination concerning tackling climate change, India and Brazil will follow, as they cannot afford to be the international ‘villains’. And the US, under a new administration, will drop any excuses for failing to take action itself.
The EU should expect of China that it treat climate change as an urgent priority in its national economic policies. The EU expects of China that it will implement its national plan to tackle climate change and to cut carbon emissions from factories, power plants and vehicles. At the same time we acknowledge with interest the adoption of the law on renewable energy and the aim, by 2020, to generate 15% of energy from renewable sources.
China advocates the establishment of an effective mechanism on technology co-operation and transfer to promote research and development, deployment and transfer of climate-sound technologies by means of adequate financing and capacity building measures, as well as the removal of barriers and the creation of the necessary incentives for technology co-operation and transfer.
Chinese officials have said that wealthy nations should divert as much as 1% of their economic activity to paying for clean technology transfers. China is waiting for a serious commitment to an adaptation fund. Adaptation must be on the top of the Copenhagen priority list.
Climate change is a challenge that knows no borders and demands cross-border responses. Dialogue and, above all, willingness from both developing and developed countries to do their part, is the way forward to finding concrete ways to work more closely together. There is room for optimism, as climate change has become a very high priority for China’s leadership.
The EU should expect of China that it plays a more active role in fighting global warming
As for the EU, the best example we can give to the developing world is to adopt stringent binding targets while putting an end to the relocation of our ‘dirty’ industries. We need to show that we are serious about tackling climate change and shouldering our share of the burden.
Greek left (GUE-NGL) MEP Dimitris Papadimoulis is a member of the Parliament’s temporary committee on climate change and its delegation to China.

Germany gets tough as EU nears budget overhaul deadline
Tim Jones
European Voice
By	Simon Taylor and	
2/24/99, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 4:21 AM CET
GERMAN Chancellor Gerhard Schröder will isolate EU government leaders from their most trusted ministers and aides at this week's summit in a bid to break months of deadlock over the Union's long-term budget.
In a letter to fellow leaders outlining his plans for a special summit in Bonn tomorrow (26 February), Schröder told them: "I think we should reduce the number of accompanying people to what is absolutely necessary; no more than four. In the conference room itself, only the heads of state and government and the president of the Commission should be present."
By 'hothousing' the group of leaders, the chancellor hopes to force France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK into early concessions on the EU's 2000-06 spending plans in time for a deal in Berlin on 24-25 March.
"We should keep in mind that, on this day, it is not a question of reaching final decisions but developing approaches for possible compromises within an overall package, to prepare the ground for a final decision in Berlin," Schröder stated in his letter.
Bonn is stepping up the pressure for a deal by warning of an impending political crisis and even a further weakening of the euro if no agreement is reached next month. "A delay would be understood as a sign of Europe's inability to act, of political divisions in Europe; it could even have effects on currency stability," Deputy Foreign Minister Günther Verheugen said in an interview with European Voice.
The 6% fall in the value of the euro since its inception, to 1.0970 dollars this week, has rung alarm bells at the European Central Bank, where officials fear that a rise in import prices could feed inflation.
In the run-up to the Bonn summit, France and Germany were at loggerheads over Schröder's wish to establish a 283.5-billion euro ceiling on farm subsidies over the next seven years before agreeing fundamental reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy.
In Bonn, the chancellor wants to focus on cracking three critical elements of the budget package: devising new revenue streams for the EU; compensating fiscally overburdened governments; and setting spending caps for farm subsidies and regional aid.
Only a minority of governments, led by Germany and the Netherlands, are still pressing for the creation of a new 'mechanism' to refund countries deemed to be paying more than their fair share into EU coffers.
Given their failure so far to win over France, Italy and Spain, diplomats expect Schröder and Dutch Premier Wim Kok to round on British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the summit. Both leaders believe Blair should put the annual 3-billion euro rebate the UK receives for excessive contributions back into the pot to help pay for a 'generalised correction mechanism'.
Schröder will also seek the support of the Spanish, Irish, Portuguese and Greek premiers for a flexible cap on farm spending in 2000-06 of 283.5 billion euro and on regional aid of 200 billion euro. This would amount to a real-terms freeze of 80% of the EU's budget.
At recent meetings of finance and foreign ministers, 11 governments expressed their support for these spending ceilings but Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece stood firm in opposing them.
Member states are closer to agreement on 'stabilising' spending on internal policies (education, research, transport and employment programmes), and on foreign policy.
A draft budget accord prepared by Bonn suggests that internal spending should be 5.9-6.1 billion euro in 2000 and rise to no more than 6.7 billion euro in 2006. Expenditure on foreign policy initiatives would be even tighter, starting at 4.6-4.7 billion euro, and rising to no more than 4.85 billion euro.

Reding pledges to defend EU film subsidies
Audio-visual Commissioner Viviane Reding has pledged to fight the corner of the poorest relations of the Union’s beleaguered film industry as her competition counterpart Mario Monti prepares new guidelines for state handouts to the industry.
European Voice
By	Peter Chapman	
2/9/00, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 5:26 AM CET
Monti's officials are expected to unveil tough criteria later this year aimed at ensuring that state aids to the sector do not undermine competition from unsubsidised film companies.
But Reding argues that the guidelines must not prevent member states from supporting films which the market would refuse to fund, and says she will call on Monti to allow small member states or those whose native tongue is only spoken by a few million citizens - such as her native Luxembourg, Denmark or Finland - to be given more scope to hand out subsidies.
She points out that films in lesser-used languages which are successful in their domestic markets may still be doomed to financial failure because they are unlikely to sell in other countries.
"A Finnish film, for example, has no chance to bring in the money because the audience is not there. This is not the case with a Spanish or French film," she told European Voice.
"If we want to preserve the Finnish industry, we have to allow higher subsidies. They have to be higher where the possible audience is such that the commercial equilibrium cannot be obtained."

Do all of the approved incomers fit into main enclosure of the MGBN range of Isobar distribution boards.
Incomers up to and including 125A
The Isolators and RCD's fit directly into the distribution boards.
Incomers above 125A
Isolators and MCCB's fit directly into the distribution boards but come complete with an extension box to allow for cabling space.
The 160A RCD incomer is a larger device, and fits into both the distribution board and the extension box included in the kit. Space is still available for incoming cables.
Notes:
The extension boxes included with incomers above 125A are 270mm high.
Incomers above 125A are also available without the extension boxes. Cabling space will have to be provided by other means.

r
Septic Tank Maintenance
The importance of regular septic tank maintenance, simply cannot be underestimated. Like anything that keeps our homes running smoothly, septic systems require maintenance on a somewhat regular basis. Neglecting them is consequently one of the most common causes of septic failure, damage, and malfunction.

Septic Tank Cleaning
The importance of cleaning your system can be underestimated. If the septic tank is not cleaned regularly, solids will overflow from the tank and into the leaching system. This will result in clogged leach lines, contaminated soil, and ultimately leach failure.

Need help with septic tank pumping in Estero Florida?
The average national cost of septic tank pumping and cleaning is $350, with most Estero homeowners spending between $250 and $483. This data is based on actual project costs in Florida.
If your tank hasn’t been pumped in the last 5 years, you are seeing wet areas or standing water above your drainfield, your toilets are running slowly or there are odors in your FL home, you may need to have your septic system cleaned. Below are some things to think about that will influence the cost of your septic system cleaning.
Pumping
Under normal conditions, you should pump your Florida tank every 1-3 years based upon the number of people living in your home. Generally, this pumping will take around 30-45 minutes. If you know the location of your septic system, this could save you some money on the back end because your Estero FL professional won’t have to charge you the time to locate it.
Size of tank
Obviously, smaller tanks cost less to clean, although you may need to do them more often. Larger tanks require more labor and possible machinery to dig up and pump the tank.
Replacing common parts
You may need parts replaced, such as a filter, which could cost a few hundred dollars. However, this filter is necessary in maintaining the function and longevity of your Estero drainfield.
Soil fracturing
If your professional notices that your tank is failing, they can sometimes resurrected by properly pumping the tank, cleaning the drain field lines, installing filters and a process known as fracturing the soil, which involves inserting a hollow tube into the ground and injecting a 300-pound blast of air. While this procedure could cost into the thousands dollars, it’s much less expensive and much less hassle than installing a new system, especially in Estero Florida.
Keeping it clean
You know that your septic tank will work only if the bacteria in it are healthy and hungry. If they get sick or die, your septic tank will start sending un-digested waste out to the drain field which will quickly plug it up. Below are some “weird” things that could kill your septic tank:
Chemotherapy Drugs
Anti-Bacterial Hand Washing Soap
Toilet Bowl Cleaners
Bath and Body Oils
Dishwashers
Water Softeners
Time-Release Pills and Capsules
Tip
Once your septic tank is uncovered – take photos of it and diagram it in relation to your home. This information can save you money and could prove valuable if your tank needs additional service in the future.

Crime
Mafia boss gunned down in front of New York home
By Timothy Bella
March 15, 2019 — 3.57am
Normal text size

Frank Cali, the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family whose deep ties to the Sicilian Mafia made him a figure of influence and power in both New York and Sicily, was fatally shot on Wednesday night outside his home in Staten Island, New York, police said.
Francesco "Franky Boy" Cali.
At around 9.15pm, Cali, 53, was in front of his red-brick colonial style home in the Todt Hill neighbourhood when he was approached by a blue pickup truck. Known as "Franky Boy", the Gambino boss was reportedly shot six times in the chest and run over by the truck, as first reported by the New York Daily News. Police said that a suspect sped off in the truck, WNBC reported.
Cali's death marks the first time in 33 years that a crime family boss was fatally shot in New York City.
In a statement, an official with the New York Police Department's 122nd Precinct, which covers Staten Island, said authorities responded to a 911 call at 9.17pm of an assault involving Cali. The address given on Hilltop Terrace near Four Corners Road, by the Richmond County Country Club, matched Cali's address, according to public records.

"Upon arrival, officers found a 53-year-old male with multiple gunshot wounds to the torso," police said. "EMS also responded to the scene and transported the victim to Staten Island University North, where he was pronounced deceased."
Police said that no arrests have been made and that the investigation is ongoing. Investigators are obtaining and reviewing any available video surveillance from the scene.
Reports of sobbing, panic and fear from witnesses late on Wednesday provided a window into the chaotic, swift violence that unfolded in a quiet neighbourhood long known for its mob history.

"There were like six shots, and then there were three more," one witness told the Daily News. "The man was on the ground face-up. His head was by his SUV, and the truck was open."
A neighbour told the New York Times that he heard a series of gunshots from what he believed to be a single gun.
"I just heard the pow-pow-pow-pow-pow," he said.
In 1985, another Gambino crime boss, Paul Castellano, was assassinated under the orders of John Gotti outside Manhattan's Sparks Steak House. Cali lived less than a kilometre away from Castellano's home.

Once described as "the rising star of the American mafia", Cali was an influential figure who surrounded himself with many Italian-born associates. He gained the trust of Jackie "The Nose" D'Amico, an acting boss who promoted him to capo before 40.
Cali's ascension within the Gambino crime family, once considered one of the most significant criminal organisations in the US, came years after federal prosecutors sent its top leaders to prison, crippling its national and global reach. One of those prosecutors, Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's attorney, used the 1986 indictment of the heads of the five crime families to help launch his successful campaign for mayor of New York years later.
As a leader, Cali was reportedly considerably less flashy than the ebullient Gotti, another Gambino boss, and was described by the New York Post as "a real quiet old-school boss". Cali's influence reportedly stemmed from his family connections with the Inzerillo crime family in Palermo, Sicily.
"Cali is seen as a man of influence and power by organised crime members in Italy," Assistant US Attorney Joey Lipton said during a bail hearing in 2008.
Lipton went on to quote an intercepted conversation from an Italian mobster, who described Cali as "a friend of ours".
"He is everything over there," the mobster allegedly said, referring to Cali's stature in New York.
Loading
Federal authorities recognised Cali's sense of stability and attempted to stop his meteoric rise. In what would be his only mob-related criminal conviction, Cali pleaded guilty to conspiring to extort money in 2008, stemming from a failed bid to build a NASCAR track on Staten Island years earlier. He was released after completing a 16-month prison sentence. Upon his release, the Justice Department ordered that Cali not come in contact with his uncle, John Gambino, if it was not approved ahead of time by his probation officer. (Gambino died at 77 of natural causes in 2017.)
In 2015, Cali was reportedly elevated to acting boss of the Gambino crime family, succeeding Domenico Cefalu, according to the Daily News. During his run with the family, Cali was looked at as a unifying leader, concentrating on enhancing the organisation's role in the OxyContin and heroin trade, the New York Post reported.
The death in Todt Hill came on the same day that Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Cammarano jnr, and his consigliere, John Zancocchio, were acquitted in federal court of charges of racketeering and conspiracy to commit extortion.

Stereophile: the Next Generation
Stereophile Staff | Mar 1, 2019
Today, Stereophile announces its first major Editorial changes in decades, with an expansion of the Editorial team and a change in leadership.
Since 1986, through many generations of corporate ownership, John Atkinson (right, above) has been the Editor and bedrock of the magazine. After nearly 331/3 years, JA has decided to relinquish daily responsibility for producing the magazine and as of April 1 will take on a new (and newly established) position: Technical Editor. Stepping into his shoes as Editor will be long-time Stereophile contributor Jim Austin (left, above). Deputy Editor Art Dudley will continue to do what he does best (and what he prefers to do): writing columns and reviews and editing the prose of Stereophile's other contributors, while managing an expanded suite of responsibilities. Richard Lehnert, who began his association with Stereophile in 1984 as our long-time Copy Editor and was the magazine's Music Editor 19871996, has also chosen this time to retire from the magazine that bears the stamp of his influence; Lehnert will be replaced by a new copyeditor, Linda Felaco. These changes will be effective as of the July issue of Stereophile.
"I'm deeply honored to become only the third Editor in Stereophile's distinguished history," says Austin, who has been writing for Stereophile for some 15 years. "It's a major responsibility to follow in the footsteps of audio legends like J. Gordon Holt and John Atkinson, and to hold the reins of the world's most important high-end audio magazine. It's an opportunity I relish, though. It's hard to even imagine a job I'd enjoy more."
As a teenager, Jim spent many hours at the Sound Shack, the audio boutique in his home town of Ft. Pierce, Florida. That's where he bought his first serious pair of loudspeakers, Polk Audio Model 7Bs, which he paired with a succession of Japanese receivers and Technics turntables. Later, he earned a PhD in physics and worked for a while as a research scientist, applying methods from nuclear physics to study of semiconductors and other materials. "It was nothing to do with music," Austin says, "but I was an experimental physicist and I learned a lot about electronics and craft." Still later he became an Editor at Science magazine, where he worked for 14 years, rising to the rank of Senior Editor while contributing to Stereophile on the side.
Despite the change in leadership, major editorial changes are not envisioned at the magazine. "Stereophile is a successful magazine," Jim says, "which is remarkable when you consider all the titles that folded or today exist only online. I intend to look for opportunities to make Stereophile better: more engaging, more relevant, more entertaining, with the best, most insightful writing about music and audio.
"My main objective, though, is to steer a steady courseto keep Stereophile pointed in the direction it has been pointed in for decades. In particular, Stereophile has always been a subjectivist audio journal. Its main concern has always been with how music sounds through the equipment we review and how it affects us, the listeners. But for 30 years Stereophile has been built upon the edifice of John Atkinson's measurements, which examine whether the components we review are thoughtfully and solidly engineered. Under my watch, we'll continue to do both those things, with, I hope, renewed vigor."
John Atkinson adds: At last fall's Rocky Mountain Audio Fest I asked a young Stereophile reader how he had discovered us. "I started reading my Dad's copy," he explained. "He used to read you in Hi-Fi News magazine in the 1980s."
I blanched. But yes, approaching 71 years old, I am long in the tooth. The June issue of Stereophile will be my 390th and though my hearing is still good, I decided it was time to hand the reins over to a new and, more importantly, a younger man.
As Jim noted, I will still be on Stereophile's masthead as Technical Editor. But having worked with Jim for the past 15 years, I know as Editor he will succeed in taking J. Gordon Holt's and my magazine to even greater heights. You have the conn, Jim.

I find this interesting. First, let me congratulate both men - JA, I was 9 years old when you took over and you arguably shaped many of my current beliefs about sound and many of my considerable spending decisions through the years; and JA2, whose conclusions I haven't always shared, but whose articles I have always read from beginning to end with interest. I've viewed JA's "quant" a welcome counter to the pages of "qual", which has always been Stereophile's yin to TAS's yang. In this regard JA2's appointment is a continuation of something that I have always regarded as a quality that made Stereophile the absolute best... "TAB". I have hired many people that I feel counter the norm, or my own personal beliefs, on the hope they'd create a diversity of thought that hedge the downside risk of groupthink and hivemind; in that regard I think this change ensures Stereophile's relevance for years to come, albeit with some turnover in staff given what I suspect is a strong personality. I say this in a positive sense. I don't know JA2, but my inference from his articles and comments is that he will kick the tires at every turn! Congratulations to both of you!

In communications with Jim, I've found him to be enthusiastic, searching, experienced, and knowledgeable -- perfect material for the job. Had I not disposed of my vinyl collection and STD/Hadcock/Nytech set-up back in 1983 to go to university, I would have trod an audio career path. Schmuck that I am, now I'm re-buying it all again. Heigh-ho...

Scientific Rigor ?
Submitted by johnnythunder on March 2, 2019 - 6:50pm
You're joking. The magazine has it already. It's called the measurements section of the review. Keep Stereophile exactly as it is. This is not Scientific American. It is art and magic and it cannot be explained with measurements or algorithms. If you can't accept that by now after 50 years of Stereophile and TAS, you're in the wrong hobby.

"Double Blind Tests" PROVE that all vodkas taste the same and that a Stradivarius is indistinguishable from a student violin. Actually those stupid results prove double blind tests though useful for many things are often not. And then as I found out when challenged to a double blind amplifier test that didn't go the way the test designer wished (to prove all amps that measure the same are sonically indistinguishable), excuses are made and "outlier" results (like when I got all identifications correct) get tossed.

Submitted by Anton on March 4, 2019 - 12:13pm
I love DBT (usually SBT and I get to play with the volume) but I know what you mean.
I have an acquaintance who did the "Brita" challenge at a science meeting neurology conference with a good vodka compared to cheap vodka that had been filtered through a Brita. There were six different Brita samples, corresponding to "one filtration," "two filtrations," etc.
He nailed the good vodka, the cheap vodka, and identified each filter sample by how many times it had been filtered.
Amazing.
Getting the test criteria straight would help with other DBT.
At some point, someone skilled enough should be able to rise above the terrible deafness caused by DBT and be able to tell things apart, like you did with the amps!
Also, what's true for an amp driving a complex thing like a speaker may not apply to other things, like fuses, "wires," etc. Still lots to flesh out!
I was just perusing the Hi Fi News site and they actually published measurements of wires, fascinating!
As a reader, I would love to see JCA (technical editor) compare and contrast an array of findings with these more subtle devices.
Both sides of the "makes a difference / no it doesn't" crowd need to find some room for common discussion.
Transparent measurements, listening trials, all part of the fun.
Our local club does blind comparisons and nobody gets butt hurt about challenging our listening skills.
In a recent club challenge, a plain over the counter fuse won the day vs. fuses costing up to 120 bucks per fuse! So, it seemed we had the ability to hear what was up, but the challenge was won by the little guy.
We did the same thing with passive preamps at a THE Show and a 400 dollar unit KILLED the 15,000 dollar and 2,000 dollar competition. (This was on a fancy system with King's Audio electrostats, etc.)
It's like when the 6 dollar bottle of wine beats the 120 dollar bottle, good for us!
I digress...instead of feeling threatened by DBT (actually, SBT and not instantaneous would be fine,) we should start the party and see how golden our ears really are.
Man, in the realm of measurements, how about comparing the differences between "broken in" and not for equipment, and see what may change!
Everyone is so afraid of being wrong, or having their perceptions "judged" that we poo poo a very fun thing!
In wine competitions, tasting is done blind and we get feedback on our perceptions, for better or worse. Hi Fi should be able to emulate that and see what happens.

In your opinion, which DBT's are ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:43am
... "useful" and which are "stupid"?
Are the "useful" ones those with whose outcomes you agree and the "stupid" ones those with whose outcomes you disagree?
A given test doesn't prove that all vodkas taste the same.
It does demonstrate that a particular group of tasters could not reliably distinguish among the particular group of samples they tasted. If you're open-minded, you might consider conducting your own blind taste test to see if you reach the same conclusion, or not.
Likewise, outlier results shouldn't be tossed out of hand.
Rather, the test should be repeated to determine if those results can be confirmed.

Lots of people think their dog is the best dog, their religion is God's only true faith...but other people's results may vary.
Question: If the only way to "test" equipment is by using your own equipment in your home, how do you shop?
I listen in stores and at shows, as well. Otherwise, it would be almost impossible to survey the marketplace!

I've been reading Stereophile since right before the digest to large format switch over and I have always loved it. Of course, back in those days, getting your CD player and a simple DAC figured out was a priority for me, anyway. By my calculations, that's right after your (JA) takeover, so I'm pretty accustomed to your editorial style. While I do miss the old cast of characters (J10, Corey, Sam and the late Mr. Reina), I'm sure with JA2 in the drivers seat, the course will stay true. Thanks for the great ride, so far.

I had a Vinyl Audio Shop which failed when 33.3 died. My Sales continued because the Monster Cable Accessories Full Line sold quite well. I've subsequently discovered that P&A ( parts & accessories ) are the most profitable part of Businesses like mine. So, especially today, a Line ( Range if you're Brit. ) of eBay garments and accessories could be viable and exciting.
You might be in an ideal position to be Stereophile's Official OEM for all such items. You Could do Swiss Army Knives with Silver Inlayed Logos, Embroidered Hats, Silk Screened shirts and all manner of other desirable Desk Top trinket items. Your Local Speciality Sales Co. can and will provide endless useful suggestions. It could be a great business for you, you'd even be able to supply a wide range of Audio Manufacturers with High Quality Products and fulfillment.

I was referring to my Vinyl Business in the 1980s not You and your acquaintances.
The Audio Business continued, Redbook replaced 33.3, the Automotive Market bloomed into the Dominant Component of the 2 Channel Audio Industry with Billions of Dollars in Sales ( hidden in the New Car Window Sticker). The Movie Industry migrated from Magnetic Tape to 5.1 & 7.1 etc.
I attempt to be fair in saying it isn't 33.3 Vinyl's fault that it's number of proponents has tapered off to a very few committed & dedicated collectors.
Vinyl's largest problems are:
1). Prohibitively High Price of admission. ( New Playback Gear is Pricy )
and
2). Millennials ( the next generation of audiophiles ) are struggling with Tuition Debt as they complete their Diplomaed Education. They no longer have disposable income for Pricy Vinyl Audio gear in addition to the Digital Gear they are already able to access.
Vinyl's smaller problems include :
3). The amount of Support Gear needed
and
4). The Volume of Cubic Footage needed for the Record Storage Systems. ( what family is tolerant of the Vinyl Audiophile's 10,000 Record Collection.?)
So, you see, Vinyl has problems.
The Remaining 75,000 or so Vinyl playing people might be HighEnd Audio's smallest Minority, while Chad Kassem remains their Wonderful Higher Authority.
Where would Vinyl be without Chad breathing life into it?

What is your definition of ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:50pm
... "pricy" (or pricey) in regard to vinyl playback gear?
The first turntable and cartridge I bought (a few years before the introduction of CDs) would cost the equivalent of about $1,000 as adjusted for inflation.
At that price level, today, you can buy decent turntables from Audio-Technica, Pioneer, Pro-Ject and Rega, along with a moving-magnet cartridge from Audio-Technica, Nagaoka or Ortofon.
Or, for that same amount you could buy a complete system.
For example, an Audio-Technica AT-LP5 turntable (with cartridge included), plus a Yamaha R-N303 receiver (which also has a DAC and a network interface for streaming) and a pair of ELAC Debut 2.0 bookshelf speakers.
Such a system ought to be sufficient to tide over most millennials until they are able to afford something significantly more expensive.

Definition of Pricy:
Submitted by tonykaz on March 5, 2019 - 3:04pm
Vinyl playback is an extraordinarily pricy Hobby by comparison!
I'm talking HighEnd.
A VPI Avenger ( Comic Book Name? ) begins around $30,000! VPI is the finest turntable line I ever represented.
Arm price around $10,000
Phono Cart around $10,000 ( I'd think KOETSU )
Special Cables $ ?
Phono RIAA pre-amp $10,000 - up
A suitable stand for the Player $500 +
Vinyl record cleaning systems $ 500 +
Vinyl Record Storage Systems for 10,000 Records and the square footage to house them $100 per sq.ft. for 10 x 10 Room = $10,000
Buying Audiophile Vinyl $30/$50 each
A Vinyl System compared to a PS Audio DAC $5,000 playing Acoustic Sounds DSD downloads is far less expensive and far easier to maintain.
Committed Collectors, like the Vinyl Junkie, have lifetime collections to maintain.
New Millennials, starting fresh, may be vinyl curious but Digital presents a far wider mainstream Access to Glorious Music reproduction throughout 21st Century Life Environs.
There is a difference between Vinyl and the various Designers DACs: CHORD, PS Audio's Direct Stream, Schiit's Multibit, MSB's Analog DAC, etc. but the difference is small and the price differential is huge.
Price differential aside, Digital is an elegant solution to a complex problem.

He is the resident anti-vinyl crank.
His FDA nutritional requirement is to type a daily screed against vinyl in order to fill the otherwise empty void of his audio life.
As you are here longer, you can simply look for his name under a reply and treat it as "fly over country."

I saw an angry old rich white guy who appeared to be an audiophile. He was pacing back and forth with a tiki torch while muttering about this new fangled "pink noise" threatening to replace the far superior "white noise." He was wearing a hat that said "MAGA" on it.
The lightbulb went off for me, right then!
Make Audio Great Again!
I think I could find y'all some of those Audio hats and you could parade around in them to the adulation of your audiophile friends!
They only come in red, however.
We could get some Polo shirts, pop the collars, and parade around audio shows. People would love us!

It would coincide with analog's resurgence in recent years, while the use of a tiki torch by some MAGA-cap wearers is probably meant to symbolize "old school" technology.

Thanks, Ortofan,
Submitted by rschryer on March 6, 2019 - 9:17am
I enjoyed that video. And I do believe what Paul is saying.
However, as far as my own experience is concerned, when it comes to mid-priced equipment — the category of equipment I can afford — rather than the megabuck stuff, I feel more inner peace and long term satisfaction listening to a vinyl setup than I do a digital one, regardless of whether the former may exhibit more measurable distortion than the latter.
As good as mid-priced digital can be, from what I've heard (and there's a lot out there I haven't heard, especially when it comes to the latest generation of DACs), I still hear a blueish-grayish tint of mechanical artificiality that overlays the music, an effect that keeps me from becoming completely engaged in the music.
The mid-priced LP setup has other problems, but I still find that it sounds more natural overall than does its digital counterpart.
As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)

mid-priced vinyl rigs do sound better than their megalomaniac counterparts due to inevitable format limitations; nothing really special about megabuck digital either since digital holds no big secrets anyway. Delusions of grandeur might be a function of big money amongst others but good sound thankfully not.

"As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)"
I know it's said with a smiley-face, but I've always found it rather strange that "megabuck" price gets attached to "killer" sound quality.
Let's be honest that of course companies want (perhaps even need) this association to be made. However, I think audiophiles are recognizing that this is often not the case at all.

I meant killer in the sense...
Submitted by rschryer on March 8, 2019 - 10:31am
...of the cream of the crop, which, like anything else in life, comes at a premium.
This doesn't mean that all digital attached to a hefty price tag is going to be killer, and I wholeheartedly agree that there's some great-sounding digital out there that doesn't require mortgaging your house to own. But there's also a reason why Michael Fremer and Jason Victor Serinus bought uber-expensive gear from DCS rather than the $2500.00 offerings from Benchmark or Schitt, as good as the latter companies' goods are. Why else would these professional audio reviewers and lifelong music lovers choose to pay the big bucks?
I haven't heard DCS gear, but I trust MF's and JVS's hearing and their buying decisions.
That's the kind of "killer" I was referring to.

As someone who began reading Stereophile just before the transition from JGH to JA, I have experienced almost the whole range of John Atkinson's editorship (a short lapse during child rearing years). I have appreciated his deft hand on the tiller of Stereophile. I can only hope Jim Austin has as much success during his tenure.
Also since I began reading Stereophile in the first year of my career, I can't begrudge John the chance to step back as I will have been retired for 3 years in June.

Jim Austin. And thank heavens for that. I was recently contemplating that Atkinson must be getting ready to hand over the reigns, and was worried what with the amount of copy he seems to get these days that the successor was going to be named JVS. Don't get me wrong. JVS is a very good writer, but cut him back a little or the magazine will become the JVS Journal.

Stun Guns (View All)Stun Guns are one of the most popular self-defense products on the market today. Endorsed by police and rescue personnel across the country, they make for the perfect defense against a would-be attacker. Stun guns are easy to use, affordable, non-lethal and extremely effective at giving you or your loved one the opportunity to escape and alert authorities. Stun guns use a high-voltage, low-current electrical discharge to override the body’s superficial muscle-triggering mechanisms. As a result, the recipient is immobilized. The low-current is what makes it non-lethal. Generally, stun guns are about 2-3 mA, where 100 mA is lethal to humans. In addition to typical stun guns you may have seen on television and magazines, technology has advanced to create unique stun devices that look like cell phones, pens and even flashlights. Your attacker won’t even know what hit him! We offer one of the largest selections of stun guns by some of the biggest names, including Stun Master and ZAP. Before purchasing a stun gun, you should check the Stun Gun Laws and restrictions to make sure they are legal in your area.
Concealed Stun GunsConcealed and Hidden Stun Guns Concealed Stun Guns are a great self-defense weapon for anyone who needs to keep a low key as to what they are carrying. Keep them in your purse, on your belt, or even hold them right in your hand! No one will know you’re carrying millions of volts of stopping power. These concealed stun guns very popular and offer the power of surprise.
Flashlight Stun GunsStun Guns with Flashlights Flashlight Stun Guns are a great self-defense product to keep around the house, automobile, or anywhere else that you might be faced with danger. Being that you can walk around with a flashlight in your hand without raising suspicion, these concealed flashlight stun guns remove the time needed for deployment.

Dummy Security CamerasNow you can deter robbery, theft, and vandalism with a Dummy Camera. Dummy cameras are non-functioning security cameras. However, they look just like real surveillance cameras. Three of our dummy cameras include a blinking red LED and operate on batteries. The dummy camera with housing and professional dummy camera have a fake power cable. These features make the dummy cameras almost exact replicas of the real cameras. Although dummy cameras won’t catch a criminal, studies have shown that just the presence of a security camera has prevented crimes like robbery, theft and vandalism.

Women's March on Washington Attendance Higher Than Trump's Inauguration, According to Metro Ridership Numbers
"FULL CAPACITY!"

While official numbers for how many people attended Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on Friday are not yet in, if D.C. Metro ridership numbers are any indication, there seems to be way more people who attended the Women's March on Washington on Saturday.
USA Today reports that on Saturday at 11 a.m., there were already 275,000 trips on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Meanwhile, on Friday, Inauguration Day, at the same time, there were over 193,000 trips recorded.
USA Today also reports that there are an estimated 500,000 people attending the Women’s March in Washington, according to city officials. According to the Women’s March on Washington Facebook page, 231,000 had RSVPed as going, and 251,000 had marked themselves as “interested” in the event. The Women's March organizers even had to send a message on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "FULL CAPACITY! We are at full capacity on 3rd and Independence. Please enter the rally further north near 7th street. #WomensMarch"

People also posted on social media how packed the metro trains were for getting to the march:

The turnout for Trump's inauguration also sparked social media interest yesterday, when photos of the crowds at Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and Trump’s inauguration in 2017 were compared (Obama’s inauguration appeared to have a way higher turnout from the photographic evidence). Politico reports that inauguration planners estimated about an 800,000-person turnout for Trump's inauguration, but there are still no official reports of how many actually showed. The New York Times estimates Trump’s inauguration crowds were about one-third of Obama’s 2009 crowds.

Even their inaugural concert turnouts seemed to be, uh, different.

Sabathia looking to end career with a victory parade
New York Yankees starting pitcher CC Sabathia listens as his son Carter responds to a question during a news conference on Saturday in Tampa, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)
Published February 16. 2019 6:52PM
By MARK DIDTLER Associated Press
Tampa, Fla. — CC Sabathia can envision the perfect ending to his final big league season.
"Right now I'm just focused on trying to win the championship and have a parade at the end of the year," Sabathia said Saturday. "That would be a great way to top this thing off."
The 38-year-old Sabathia agreed in early November to an $8 million one-year contract and said 2019 will be his last season.
Sabathia had a stent inserted after a blockage was found in an artery from his heart in December. He has had chronic right knee problem that has required several operations.
"Why now? It's time," Sabathia said with a laugh. "My knee, just the shape that it's in. My family is getting older. It's time for me to be with them and be around them."
When asked about his dad being home more, son Carter replied, "I know it will be two times funnier in the house because you're funny and mom's funny."
Pitchers and catchers at Yankees spring training camp, and some position players taking part in early workouts were in attendance at Steinbrenner Field for Sabathia's remarks.
"All I ever wanted for people to remember me as was just a good teammate," Sabathia said. "It's been a great ride. Just so many countless different memories that I'll have. It's priceless, it's been great."
Managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner and vice chairperson Jennifer Steinbrenner Swindal, who hugged Sabathia and took a photo of him and his family, were also present.
"He's special," Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. "He's a fan favorite. He's a (Steinbrenner) family favorite. I think CC has done everything and anything he possibly could in terms of leadership and performance."
Hal Steinbrenner said he hasn't given any thought about retiring Sabathia's No. 52 because "he still has baseball to play."
The 2007 AL Cy Young Award winner with Cleveland, Sabathia is 246-153 with a 3.70 ERA and 2,986 strikeouts in 18 major league seasons. He was 9-7 with a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts last season. This will be his 11th year with the Yankees.
"I think he's a Hall of Famer and I think he will get in," Yankees manager Aaron Boone, a former teammate of Sabathia said. "Eighteen years in and still a really good pitcher in this league."
Sabathia has no interest in coaching or being a manager, but would like to return as a guest spring training instructor.
"It's been an honor to watch him play and I'm excited to see what he'll take on next," Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said in a statement. "Congrats my friend."
As part of his farewell season, Sabathia will be hosting 52 kids from a local Boys and Girls Clubs at the first game of the final road series in all AL cities. He will also do that at the National League park in San Francisco.
Severino signing
Expected opening-day starter Luis Severino said his $40 million, four-year deal reached Friday to avoid an arbitration hearing came about so quickly his mother didn't have time to come to Tampa from the Dominican Republic for a Saturday news conference.
Severino had been scheduled for a hearing in which he requested $5.25 million and the Yankees countered at $4.4 million.
"She called me and said 'what happened, you win?'" a smiling Severino said. "I said, 'No I didn't win but I got $40 million. And she said 'that's more than $5 million.'"
Severino's deal includes a team option for 2023 that could make the agreement worth $52.25 million for five seasons.
By agreeing to a long-term contract with a $10 million average annual value, New York raised its projected luxury tax payroll to about $225 million, well above the $206 million threshold.
"We have to manage our payroll in the present as well as the future," Cashman said. "There's going to be paydays coming along and we have to prepare for those. So this was an example of that."
Ellsbury update
Cashman said outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who didn't play last season due to a number of injuries, will probably not be ready for opening day after experiencing plantar fasciitis during his rehab program following hip surgery.
Ellsbury has received a cortisone ejection and is not running. He won't arrive at camp until at least mid-to-late March.
Harper and Machado
Cashman had nothing to say about free agents Bryce Harper and Manny Machado. But he added when it comes to possibly adding major or minor leaguers that the Yankees are "never a finished product" and "always open for business."

Love Is In the Air
Mommy Musings
TERESA HAMMOND
Updated: Feb. 13, 2019, 10:36 a.m.
COPY
I’ve fallen madly in love and it’s having a crazy effect on my family as result.
With Valentine’s Day this week I couldn’t help but reflect on my good fortune of the depth of this feeling and how it’s tilted my world a bit sideways.
That’s the funny thing about falling in love, isn’t it? You’re never completely ready for how your world will be altered by the simple swelling of your heart.
While many may perceive this to be exclusive to a partner or companionship, the act of falling in love actually transcends more than that. As a parent, I still recall the feeling of my heart swelling at the birth of my two children. Each love affair different from the other.
I still recall the moment my son, my first, took my heart. Just moments following his birth, blue beanie, chubby cheeks and swaddled tight, as our eyes locked I knew I was a goner forever. He made me a mom. A title I had fought six years to acquire; had finally arrived.
The arrival of my daughter and our love story was a bit different. Her arrival was a bit more challenging, completely more exhausting and it truly wasn’t until she and I were alone that I was able to see the love in her eyes. My inquisitive one, she arrived in the delivery room surveying her company, our connection would have to wait. The love affair was there, however, all the same.
Prior to earning that title, I knew what it meant to fall in love traditionally speaking with their father. Truth be told, our fur babies also made my heart swell as we brought them home and took on the pet responsibility (pre-kid).
Which brings me to the most recent love affair that I’ve shared a bit about in a previous column, as well as in the February/March edition of the 209 Magazine. The addition of our black lab puppy Charlotte has indeed spun our home for the better.
There’s just something about a puppy that breathes a different life into a home.
As the kids and I navigate life now that they are 11 and 14, things can be a bit serious at times, but then there’s Charlotte. Listening to my children dote on her, treat her as a younger sibling (no, we’re not crazy) and care for her makes my heart swell all the more.
The magic she’s brought to our home, the laughter and the head shakes are absolutely priceless.
The decision to take on a puppy is a big one. Fortunately for the three of us, I tend to be a bit impulsive. That’s honestly the only explanation I can give for why I felt a puppy was the right choice at this stage in our lives, but it was the right one.
Charlotte is smart, energetic, loving, playful, funny and a great companion. No that’s not her dating profile, but it is several of the many reasons she makes my heart swell.
So, as each of you embrace the “holiday” which some love and others love to hate, I encourage you to celebrate what makes your heart swell. Maybe it’s not a spouse, partner, significant other or maybe it is. Maybe it’s not a child, children or a dog. Maybe it’s your garden, a collection of treasured books, a volunteer opportunity or a life dedicated to something you love – celebrate that. Love, as they say, is in the air and it would be a pity for it to go wasted.
Happy Valentine’s Day!

As the year comes to a close, we can’t help but reflect. We all just spent time with families and friends thinking about what we’re thankful for and now it’s time to think back on what we’ve gone through this year.
Even though we may have similar day-to-day lives here on campus, we’ve all had vastly different experiences that we consider important. The end of the year is a good time to look back on these important things and consider what lessons we want to take into next year.
We started off the year with an inspiring display of feminist resistance at the Women’s March on Washington, D.C. to protest the Jan. 20 inauguration of Donald Trump.
This was the first defining moment of political protest this year, a movement that continued with a swell of activism from people on all points of the political spectrum.
Some have hit close to home, like the ongoing DACA rescission crisis and the potentially life-altering changes that immigrants may have to face, or the potential ramifications of proposed tax reform bills on students’ financial aid and loans.
This year has also been marked by several catastrophic events that we’ve had to weather together. 2017 has been plagued by terror attacks across the world, including the May suicide bombing during an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, and the more recent shooting in Las Vegas.
These attacks weren’t the only ones, though. Closer to home was the tragedy of Hurricane Harvey, which personally affected a lot of Trinity students.
As depressing as all this is, there’s still something to be gained from our experiences as a community. The growth we’ve experienced and the new bonds that were forged all over campus are some unexpected-but-positive side effects that make these hardships easier to deal with.
People are now more aware of where to find support on campus, whether it be with their friends, classmates or trained professionals like those at Counseling Services. In addition to these existing resources, some students have also extended their network by making new connections with people who share their strife.
Since we’ve reached the end of a trying year, it’s time to shift our focus to 2018. As the new year approaches, it’s important to carry forward the things that have meant the most to you personally this year. Whether they are lessons learned, new friendships or newfound passions, be sure not to forget about them.
Starting fresh is great, but having a good starting point means that you have an initial direction for the new year.
The lessons that we’ve learned this year will be essential to our development and our commitment to bettering ourselves in 2018, even if we don’t necessarily stick to our new year’s resolutions.
Whether or not we’re writing resolutions, the best thing we can do to make the most out of our struggles this year is to learn from them. Even though it’s cheesy, try to nail down what’s been most impactful this year and carry that forward not only this year, but in the years to come.

Self-Reporting Check May Have Prevented Philadelphia Tragedy
Posted on November 8, 2011 by Troutman & Troutman
Self-reporting may come under increasing scrutiny, as it appears to be behind many of the ills troubling the Social Security Administration (“SSA”). Many of the people who illegally receive disability benefits do so after reporting to the SSA that their disability is ongoing. Self-reporting problems also appear to be a red flag that the SSA missed in the horrific case out of Philadelphia from a few weeks ago, where several people are facing charges relating to human trafficking and the theft of disability benefits.
Police have now arrested four people in connection with the crimes that centered on Social Security disability fraud. The four had been keeping a group of mentally disabled adults locked in a basement while collecting their Social Security checks. Additionally, authorities have placed eight children in protective custody that the four suspects also had under their control.
It looks like authorities and the SSA may have missed a couple warning signs. First, there is a 2004 law that prohibits people who have been in prison longer than a year from receiving disability benefits on behalf of another person. It is up to the person submitting the application to answer this question truthfully, however. The alleged ringleader of these crimes – Linda Ann Weston – evidently did not do so.
One of the victims in this case was reported missing back in December in 2008 from his Norfolk, Virginia residence. The man’s mental health case worker reported him missing and the police made a report, but nothing ever turned up. The same case worker knew that the man’s disability checks were going to an address in Philadelphia. Philadelphia police visited the address, but a woman living there said no one by that name lived there.
Do you have any experience with the disability benefits application process, whether applying for the first time or for continuing to receive benefits? Were there certain self-reporting questions that you felt that the SSA should do a better job of following up on?

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Osteomyelitis
Call (214) 389-6475 for a Consultation
Chronic refractory osteomyelitis persists or recurs following appropriate interventions. These interventions include the prolonged use of antibiotics, drainage of the abscess, immobilization of the affected extremity, and surgical debridement with removal of as much of infected bone matrix as possible. Medicare may cover the adjunctive use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for chronic refractory osteomyelitis that has been shown to be unresponsive to conventional medical and surgical management.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an adjunctive therapy used with the appropriate antibiotics and surgical debridement to eliminate the necrotic bone acting as a foreign body. When the site of the bone infection is not amenable to debridement or resection, HBOT may be indicated to enhance systemic therapy though is not indicated as primary therapy alone.
Hyperbaric oxygen treatments are usually delivered daily for a period of 90-120 minutes and it is not unusual to receive daily treatments following major debridement surgery. The usual course of therapy lasts 4-6 weeks with daily sessions lasting 90-120 minutes up to a maximum of 60 treatments within a 12 month period as designated by the CMS preauthorization project. Additional treatments may be considered reasonable and necessary on redetermination.
HYPERBARIC oxygen therapy is not considered medically reasonable or necessary for treatment of osteomyelitis of small, solid or non-weight-bearing bones of the forefoot and fingers (metatarsal bones, phalanges) which are more effectively treated with debridement and receive minimal benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy due to limited perfusion. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not considered reasonable and necessary for primary or non-adjunctive treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.

What is Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy?
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy or HBOT is a medical treatment, which is given by placing the patient’s entire body in an enclosed chamber. The patient breathes 100% oxygen while under increased pressure. Most patients are treated at a pressure equivalent of 2-2.5 times the normal atmospheric pressure.
Back to top
How does Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Work?
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy delivers a high concentration of oxygen systemically. The increased pressure changes the normal cellular respiration process and causes oxygen to dissolve in the blood plasma to that it carries oxygen in addition to red blood cells. This results in a substantial increase in tissue oxygenation. This provides several benefits; stimulates the growth of new blood vessels, increases oxygenation that can arrest certain types of infections, reduce inflammation, and enhance wound healing.
Back to top
What are the clinically accepted indications For HBOT?
In the United States, almost all health care plans/third party payors reimburse for HBOT treatments listed below. There are numerous conditions reimbursed by commercial payors and workman’s compensation. In addition, other areas in the world are using HBOT for numerous other conditions.
Diabetic wounds
Radiation tissue damage (Osteoradionecrosis)
Osteomyelitis (Refractory)
Skin grafts and flaps (Compromised)
Necrotizing soft tissue infections
Thermal burns
Crush injury, compartment syndrome, and other acute traumatic ischemias
Clostridial Myonecrosis (Gas gangrene)
Actinomycosis
Air or gas embolism
Carbon monoxide poisoning
Smoke inhalation
Decompression sickness
Severe anemia
Cyanide Poisoning
Back to top
Is there research being done on other conditions being treated with HBOT?
HBOT is now experiencing widespread use throughout the world for a number of acute and chronic conditions. Aggressive federally and privately supported clinical trials are being conducted in the United States and abroad. Worldwide applications or research has been done on such conditions as: Autism, Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), Post Concussion Syndrome, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Ulcers of the Lower Limb, Acute Thermal Burns, Osteoradionecrosis, Brain Injury, Sequelae, Stroke, Anoxia, Trauma, Retinitis Pigmentosa, Periodontal Disease, Radiation Injuries, Laryngeal Cancer, Glioblastomas, Gliosarcoma, Trigeminal Neuralgia Pain, Radiation-Induced Xerostomia, White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH), Osteoradionecrosis, Osteonecrosis and more. Please click here for more information on clinical studies.
Back to top
What are some conditions that may be treated with HBOT?
Diabetic wounds
Bone and soft tissue infections
Radiation tissue damage
Failed grafts and flaps
Pre and post surgery for faster healing and better patient outcome
Autism
Stroke
Poisonous snake and spider bites
MS
Lyme Disease
Anti-aging
Memory and Alzheimer’s
Back to top
Do I need a prescription for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy?
Yes for conditions that are covered by insurance or Medicare. Please call the clinic for questions about this. Patients can be referred to us by their personal physician or can have a consultation by our Medical Director to determine if HBOT is a recommended therapy for their condition.
Back to top
How many treatments are required?
The number of treatments is determined by the condition being treated and how well the patient is responding to the therapy. Example, the protocol for wound care is generally 20-40, 2-hour treatments. Treatments are done everyday five days a week. Therapy for a sports injury is 1 hour per day until the problem is resolved.
Back to top
What can I do during my treatment?
Patients rest comfortably during the treatment watching TV , listening to music or napping.
Back to top
What does a Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment feel like?
During the first beginning and again at the end of the treatment the patient will notice the pressure change in the need to “pop” “clear” their ears, much the same as in an airplane on decent. During the majority of the treatment while at pressure, the patient will rest comfortably as if they were just sitting in the room. Patients should let the staff know if they have a cold or allergies that is causing plugged ears or sinus. Precautions should be taken to insure ears and sinus are clear prior to treatment.
Back to top
Do patients suffer from claustrophobia?
Most HBOT patients do not experience confinement anxiety or claustrophobia in our chambers. We have the largest acrylic monoplace chambers on the market. A 6 ft patient can sit at a comfortable 45 degrees in the clear optically perfect chamber.
Back to top
Will family members be able to remain in the hyperbaric room during treatments?
No. Family members can wait in our comfortable waiting room or leave and return at the end of the treatment time.
Back to top
What if I’m a smoker?
Smoking even one cigarette, causes blood vessels to constrict. This decreases the blood supply to the tissue, counteracting the benefits of the hyperbaric treatments. Patients are encouraged to not smoke during the course of their therapy.
Back to top
Contraindications
The only absolute contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy is untreated pneumothorax. Also, the treatment may raise the issue of Occupational health and safety (OHS), which has been encountered by the therapist.
Patients should not undergo HBO therapy if they are taking or have recently taken the following drugs:
Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) – A chemotherapeutic drug.
Cisplatin – Also a chemotherapeutic drug.
Disulfiram (Antabuse) – Used in the treatment of alcoholism.
Mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon) – Suppresses bacterial infections in burn wounds
The following are relative contraindications — meaning that special consideration must be made by specialist physicians before HBO treatments begin:
Upper respiratory infections – These conditions can make it difficult for the patient to clear their ears, which can result in what is termed sinus squeeze.
High fevers – In most cases the fever should be lowered before HBO treatment begins.
Emphysema with CO2 retention – This condition can lead to pneumothorax during HBO treatment.
History of thoracic (chest) surgery – This is rarely a problem and usually not considered a contraindication. However, there is concern that air may be trapped in lesions that were created by surgical scarring. These conditions need to be evaluated prior to considering HBO therapy.
Malignant disease: Cancers thrive in blood rich environments but may be suppressed by high oxygen levels. HBO treatment of individuals who have cancer presents a problem, since HBO both increases blood flow via angiogenesis and also raises oxygen levels. Taking an anti-angiogenic supplement may provide a solution. A study by Feldemier, et al. and recent NIH funded study on Stem Cells by Thom, et al., indicate that HBO is actually beneficial in producing stem/progenitor cells and the malignant process is not accelerated.
Middle ear barotrauma (MEBT) is always a consideration in treating both children and adults in a hyperbaric environment, but most children currently being treated with HBOT are being pressurized to 1.3 ATA, which reduces the risks of side effects.

An increase in gas prices easily outpaces the benefits of the tax bill for lower-income Americans

Let’s say your car holds 12 gallons of gasoline. If you have filled up your gas tank nine times in the past week (for some reason), you have spent an average of about $61 dollars more on gas this week than you would have the day President Trump was inaugurated. If you are in the bottom 20 percent of Americans in income, we have some bad news for you: There goes your tax cut.
Democrats have decided to put a new rhetorical emphasis on rising gas prices. Though those prices are largely independent of the effects of policy enacted in the United States, given that they’re a function of a complex international system, Democrats hope to blame Trump for the recent increase by suggesting that his decision to back out of the Iran nuclear agreement caused prices to spike.
Here are the Senate Democrats making that case, for example.
Across the country, gas prices are rising.
It's clear who to blame: @realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/eKxq4yDjD0
— Senate Democrats (@SenateDems) May 21, 2018
It’s true that over the course of his presidency, gas prices have increased more than they had at the same point in the first terms of presidents Bill Clinton or George W. Bush. During Barack Obama’s first term, the increase was steeper — though that occurred fairly early in his first term, after which prices stabilized.
The increase under Trump has been more significant during the past few weeks.
It isn’t clear how much this is a function of the Iran deal as opposed to, say, the normal increase seen for the summer months. Trump’s announcement on the deal only happened a few weeks ago, and the upward trend began before that.
But as Trump noted on the campaign trail, gas prices are a significant factor for the economic well-being of many American households. (Trump blamed Obama for gas price increases, a move that, predictably, will probably come back to haunt him.)
The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles data looking at how much households spend on gasoline. On average in 2016, consumers spent the equivalent of a bit over 3 percent of their household incomes on gas. That wasn’t uniformly the case; wealthier consumers spent a lower percentage of their incomes on gas even as they bought more of it. The highest percentage spent was by middle-income Americans.
In 2016, the average price for a gallon of gasoline was $2.14, according to the Federal Reserve. A gallon now costs about 78 cents more. If the average for 2018 were to hold at the current price, the average American household would spend about $700 more on gas than it did in 2016 — and, assuming incomes hold steady, the percent of incomes spent on gas would increase to 4.5 percent. Again, though, those in the middle range would end up spending more of their incomes.
But let’s set that aside and instead consider the increase in costs resulting from increasing gas prices — a political liability for Trump and his party — with the gains in income Americans can expect to see from Trump’s tax cuts, a policy move Republicans hope will be an asset.
The Tax Policy Center calculated how much people in various income groups would be expected to see in federal tax cuts thanks to the new tax law passed last year. In many cases, the expected cuts are minor. If we compare those expected cuts to how much more a household might pay in gas costs,* using the increase from Trump’s first week in office until now, the results are remarkable.
Those in the bottom 20 percent of income-earners will pay three or four times more in higher gas prices than they’ll get back in tax cuts. Those in the next highest quintile of incomes will see a wash — getting back about as much as they pay in higher gas prices.
There is a lot of gauziness to these numbers, of course, comparing a lot of different averages with one another. But the benefits of the federal tax cuts to the lowest-income Americans are modest enough that even a small increase in gas prices over the short term means that any benefits from those cuts are quickly swamped.
And all of this is true even if gas prices don’t continue to rise. If they do, the calculus becomes much more stark for the White House — as do the politics.
* The methodology here: Using the BLS data from 2016, we figured out how many gallons of gas a household bought by dividing the amount spent on gasoline in that year by the average price of a gallon from the Federal Reserve data. Then we multiplied that by the change in gas prices from the most recent week to the week of Trump’s inauguration.

Ahead of debate, Trump holds news conference with Bill Clinton accusers

Hours before the presidential debate in St. Louis, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump held a news conference with four women who have accused the Clintons of inappropriate behavior. (Facebook/Donald J. Trump)
ST. LOUIS — Donald Trump held a news conference Sunday night with several women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual improprieties, ahead of a crucial second presidential debate against Hillary Clinton that comes amid a cascade of criticism for lewd remarks he made about touching women against their will.
“Thank you very much for coming. These four very courageous women have asked to be here and it was our honor to help them. And I think they’re each going to make just an individual, short statement. And then will do a little meeting, and we will see you at the debate,” Trump said at the beginning of the news conference at the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis.
Sitting at a table with Trump were Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey, all of whom have accused Bill Clinton of sexual improprieties. Also seated at the table was Kathy Shelton, a victim of child sexual assault whose alleged rapist Hillary Clinton defended as his court-appointed attorney decades ago.
“Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me. I don’t think there’s any comparison,” Broaddrick told a small group of reporters who had been invited to attend the news conference.
[Coverage of Sunday night's debate]
Broaddrick has made such statements before, but no criminal case has been litigated and the Clintons deny the accusations.
A video surfaced Friday of Trump making lewd comments in which he said that his celebrity status allowed him to touch women against their will. He and his campaign have been under intense scrutiny in the days since, with a cascade of high-profile Republicans withdrawing their support as a result.
[Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005]
“Mr. Trump, does your star power allow you to touch women without their consent?” a reporter asked Trump before the news conference started. Trump ignored the question.
“I’m here to support Mr. Trump because he’s going to make America great again. I think everybody else should vote for him,” Jones said. “I think they should all look at the fact that he’s a good person, he’s not what other people have been saying he’s being, like Hillary. So think about that.”
Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, is married to George Conway, an attorney who worked on Jones's 1997 sexual harassment suit against Bill Clinton. Trump in 1998 attacked Jones during an interview with CNBC and praised the then-president's stewardship of the economy. “Paula Jones is a loser, but the fact is that she may be responsible for bringing down a president indirectly,” Trump said.
Shelton gave a particularly emotional testimonial, pausing at one moment as Trump encouraged her.
“At 12 years old Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through,” Shelton said. “And she says she’s for women and children and she was asked last year what happened and she said she’s supposed to defend whether they did it or not. Now she’s laughing on tape saying she know they did it.”
The Clinton campaign denounced the news conference, calling it an “act of desperation.”
“We’re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom,” Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. “Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn’t change that. If Donald Trump doesn’t see that, that’s his loss. As always, she’s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.”

By - Associated Press - Tuesday, September 27, 2016
ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York’s top judge has scheduled a hearing on the statewide need for legal services by New Yorkers who can’t afford lawyers.
Chief Judge Janet DiFiore will preside, with witnesses including former Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman. He instituted several measures to help close what he and other court officials identified as the “enormous access to justice gap” afflicting poorer New Yorkers who need legal help in civil matters.
Others scheduled to testify include JPMorgan Vice Chairman Stephen Cutler, Columbia Law School Professor Suzanne Goldberg, presiding justices from the state’s four appellate divisions and clients of nonprofit groups providing legal services.
DiFiore plans to report to the Legislature and make funding recommendations.

After days of conflicting statements about a timeline for President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, a U.S. defense official said Friday the process has begun with the removal of some military cargo.The official said the movement of equipment is part of what the military calls a "deliberate withdrawal" from Syria, where some 2,000 troops have been working with a coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to defeat the remnants of the Islamic State group.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not yet been publicly announced, provided no numbers, but said the equipment withdrawal is underway and that an unspecified number of additional U.S. troops have been brought into Syria to assist with the process, including by providing additional security.Hours earlier, Col. Sean Ryan, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group, said "the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria" has started. He said the U.S. would not discuss a specific timeline, locations or troop movements out of concern for operational security.There has been confusion over plans to implement Trump's pullout order and threats from Turkey to attack the Kurdish fighters, who Ankara views as terrorists because of their ties to insurgents within Turkey.Earlier this week, the U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said American troops will not leave northeastern Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) is defeated and American-allied Kurdish fighters have been protected, signaling a slowdown in Trump's initial order for a rapid withdrawal.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict in Syria through a network of activists on the ground, said the withdrawal began Thursday night. It said a convoy of about 10 armored vehicles, in addition to some trucks, pulled out from Syria's northeastern town of Rmeilan into Iraq.A senior Kurdish politician said the Kurds are aware of the U.S. beginning the withdrawal, describing it as "America's decision.""The Americans have a right to make decisions that are in their country's security and national interests," said Ilham Ahmed, who co-chairs the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Council in northeastern Syria.She added that the peace and stability of areas from which U.S. forces withdraw "must be guaranteed," including by putting an end to the Turkish threats and fully eradicating the Islamic State group and its sleeper cells.There are 2,000 American troops in Syria. Trump's abrupt decision in December to pull them out, declaring in a tweet the defeat of the IS, sent shockwaves across the region and prompted a flurry of criticism from some of his generals and national security advisers. It led to the resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and the top U.S. envoy to the anti-IS coalition. It also led to major criticism that the U.S. was abandoning its local Kurdish allies amid Turkish threats of an imminent attack.Bolton, on a visit to the region this week, said the U.S. pullout was conditional on defeating IS and guaranteed that the Kurds would be protected. His statements appeared to contradict those made earlier by Trump. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on a tour of the region, has also sought to reassure the Kurds that they will be safe after U.S. troops withdraw from the country."These have been folks that have fought with us and it's important that we do everything we can to ensure that those folks that fought with us are protected," Pompeo said of the Kurds while visiting Irbil, the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, after talks in Baghdad.After initially tweeting about the decision to bring back U.S. troops "now," Trump said this week, "we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!"Kurdish officials, meanwhile, have demanded clarifications from the U.S. over its intentions. A U.S. troop pullout leaves the Kurds exposed to Turkish forces on one side and Syrian government troops on the other. The withdrawal benefits Syrian President Bashar Assad and his international backers, Russia and Iran, who are primed to move into the region to fill a vacuum left behind by the Americans.On an unannounced visit to troops stationed near the Syrian border Friday morning, Turkey's Defense Minister Hulusi Akar reiterated Ankara is "determined" to fight Kurdish militias it considers terrorists and said military preparations were ongoing."When the time and place comes, the terrorists here will also be buried in the ditches and trenches they have dug," the minister said in southern Sanliurfa province. He spoke before the announcement on the U.S. withdrawal and did not address it.Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Americans are not serious about withdrawing from Syria.Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Friday, she said it appears the U.S. "is looking for a reason to stay." She said Russia has not seen public statements laying out the U.S. strategy in Syria and so cannot be sure that the U.S. is serious about leaving.U.S. troops have been involved in Syria's war since 2014, when the first elite forces arrived in the country to advise Kurdish-led fighters battling the Islamic State group.
After days of conflicting statements about a timeline for President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, a U.S. defense official said Friday the process has begun with the removal of some military cargo.
The official said the movement of equipment is part of what the military calls a "deliberate withdrawal" from Syria, where some 2,000 troops have been working with a coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to defeat the remnants of the Islamic State group.

Earlier this week, the U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said American troops will not leave northeastern Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) is defeated and American-allied Kurdish fighters have been protected, signaling a slowdown in Trump's initial order for a rapid withdrawal.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict in Syria through a network of activists on the ground, said the withdrawal began Thursday night. It said a convoy of about 10 armored vehicles, in addition to some trucks, pulled out from Syria's northeastern town of Rmeilan into Iraq.
A senior Kurdish politician said the Kurds are aware of the U.S. beginning the withdrawal, describing it as "America's decision."
"The Americans have a right to make decisions that are in their country's security and national interests," said Ilham Ahmed, who co-chairs the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Council in northeastern Syria.
She added that the peace and stability of areas from which U.S. forces withdraw "must be guaranteed," including by putting an end to the Turkish threats and fully eradicating the Islamic State group and its sleeper cells.
There are 2,000 American troops in Syria. Trump's abrupt decision in December to pull them out, declaring in a tweet the defeat of the IS, sent shockwaves across the region and prompted a flurry of criticism from some of his generals and national security advisers. It led to the resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and the top U.S. envoy to the anti-IS coalition. It also led to major criticism that the U.S. was abandoning its local Kurdish allies amid Turkish threats of an imminent attack.
Bolton, on a visit to the region this week, said the U.S. pullout was conditional on defeating IS and guaranteed that the Kurds would be protected. His statements appeared to contradict those made earlier by Trump. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is on a tour of the region, has also sought to reassure the Kurds that they will be safe after U.S. troops withdraw from the country.
"These have been folks that have fought with us and it's important that we do everything we can to ensure that those folks that fought with us are protected," Pompeo said of the Kurds while visiting Irbil, the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, after talks in Baghdad.
After initially tweeting about the decision to bring back U.S. troops "now," Trump said this week, "we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!"
Kurdish officials, meanwhile, have demanded clarifications from the U.S. over its intentions. A U.S. troop pullout leaves the Kurds exposed to Turkish forces on one side and Syrian government troops on the other. The withdrawal benefits Syrian President Bashar Assad and his international backers, Russia and Iran, who are primed to move into the region to fill a vacuum left behind by the Americans.
On an unannounced visit to troops stationed near the Syrian border Friday morning, Turkey's Defense Minister Hulusi Akar reiterated Ankara is "determined" to fight Kurdish militias it considers terrorists and said military preparations were ongoing.
"When the time and place comes, the terrorists here will also be buried in the ditches and trenches they have dug," the minister said in southern Sanliurfa province. He spoke before the announcement on the U.S. withdrawal and did not address it.
Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Americans are not serious about withdrawing from Syria.
Speaking to reporters in Moscow on Friday, she said it appears the U.S. "is looking for a reason to stay." She said Russia has not seen public statements laying out the U.S. strategy in Syria and so cannot be sure that the U.S. is serious about leaving.
U.S. troops have been involved in Syria's war since 2014, when the first elite forces arrived in the country to advise Kurdish-led fighters battling the Islamic State group.

Compare Health Insurance Rates in Linneus, MO
Today, health insurance is a necessity for most families. Health insurance helps subscribers pay for a portion of most routine and unexpected medical costs. There are many varieties of health insurance on the market and choosing the right one for an individual’s personal situation can seem like a daunting task. Some plans can pay directly to the care provider while others require the subscriber to pay the provider first and then submit the receipt to be reimbursed through the insurance plan. Wirefly is available to help subscribers compare health insurance plans in Linneus, MO and receive free quotes online.
Most residents in Linneus, MO usually receive health insurance through their employer sponsored plan or through private insurance. Senior citizens may be eligible to receive their health insurance through Medicare while families falling into the low-income brackets can usually get their insurance through Medicaid programs. Medicare and Medicaid programs are often less expensive than other private health insurance plans.
Linneus, MO Health Insurance Plan Comparison
Choosing the right coverage for your health care needs can be extremely hard since the future can be unpredictable. The best way to properly predict how much coverage you’ll need is to use the amount from the past year.
The first type of coverage health insurance plans offer in Linneus, MO is known as catastrophic insurance. This is the lowest cost insurance and is primarily designed for people who rarely visit their healthcare professionals. Of course, if you plan to visit your doctor on a regular basis and participate in dangerous activities, you will need a healthcare plan that can cover you more. This will usually cost you more in the end.
Most plans that provide more coverage require higher monthly payments. However, this also means that the more you put down, the more your insurance provider will give you when you run into a medical emergency. This, in turn, is why it’s so important to decide on the best plan to cover your health care needs. The last thing you want to do is purchase coverage that will offer less protection or coverage that costs too much to afford.
Different Types of Health Insurance Coverage in Linneus, MO
Several types of health insurance plans are available in Linneus, MO. Although these health insurance plans may offer similar coverage levels, their convenience of use and flexibility may vary. Choices include a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), Point of Service Plan (POS), Health Savings Account (HSA), Health Reimbursement Agreement (HRA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), and Medical Savings Account (MSA). There are many options, and comparing them may seem confusing. Before selecting a health insurance plan, however, it is important to recognize the basic differences between them.
An HMO, or Health Maintenance Organization in Linneus, MO, is a network that requires the insured to select a primary care physician (PCP) to act as the gatekeeper for your health care and related needs. If you need to visit a specialist, the primary care doctor must refer you to the specialist. He or she decides if it is necessary for you to see a specialist. HMOs typically have lower premiums than other plans, but the network of doctors available to the insured may be limited. If the insured wants to see a doctor outside of the HMO network, these doctors might not accept the HMO insurance plan. On the plus side, many HMO plans have no deductibles and out-of-pocket costs are usually reasonable.
A PPO plan, or Preferred Provider Organization, usually offers a large network of health care providers to the insured. He or she may choose any primary care doctor within the PPO network and see specialists without a referral from the primary care physician. Although the insured receives the best financial deal from in-network doctors and hospitals, he or she receives partial financial assistance for out-of-network doctors, specialists, and hospitals as well. PPO participants usually pay deductibles and copayments. Limits may apply concerning annual out-of-pocket costs.
A variety of non-traditional health insurance plans are available in Linneus, MO, such as a Health Savings Account (HSA), a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA), a Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA), and a Medical Savings Account (MSA). These approaches operate on the idea that you and/or your employer set money aside in a tax-free savings account for any medical-related expenses. Money in the plan may be used to pay for doctor visits, surgeries, prescriptions, and some over-the-counter medicines. These health care plans offer a great deal of flexibility concerning how the money is used. Some plans allow users to rollover money from year-to-year.
Details of Health Insurance Costs in Linneus, MO
When considering a health care plan in Linneus, MO, there are a lot of terms that might be unfamiliar and can be difficult to understand for those who've never come across them before. A premium is a monthly cost that's paid to cover the health insurance plan that's being provided. Even if the insurance isn't used during the course of the year, the money isn't returned.
As for the deductible, certain plans will require the insured individual to pay a small portion of money for the healthcare service before insurance covers the remainder. This is typically set to an annual amount. On the other hand, out-of-pocket expenses are the amount that has actually been paid of the deductible. Upon reaching the deductible limit, the remainder of the costs will be covered. However, if the deductible has not been reached by the end of the year, the out-of-pocket costs will go back to $0.
Co-payments with an insurance plan involve any necessary costs during the initial visit to a doctor or physician. This is usually something low like $20 or $30 for a doctor's visit. If the services provided during the visit are covered by the insurance plan, the remainder of costs will be covered. Some plans come with a maximum benefit for an individual that extends to multiple years. Once this limit is reached, the insurance company may refuse to cover any additional healthcare costs. Thankfully, this limit is usually set very high and isn't allotted by all insurance providers. Some larger Linneus, MO businesses and corporations will offer group plans that are available to all employees. These plans tend to be more affordable than individual plans.
In today's world, more and more people are self-employed. Any individual that's self-employed, and even those who are currently unemployed, have the ability to purchase a private health insurance plan on an individual basis. The premiums for these plans can be more expensive, so make sure to weigh the benefits. Senior citizens will usually be able to receive government assistance through plans like Medicare and Medicaid. These plans are typically available to anyone 65 years of age and older, though younger people with severe disabilities may also apply. To identify which health plans are best, simply speak with your doctor, as they have a better understanding of your healthcare needs. When changing health care plans, make sure that the primary care physician knows about this change. The actual provider of the insurance plan will be able to answer any questions.
Obtain a Health Insurance Quote in Linneus, MO
People do not want to have huge medical bills, and health insurance will keep individuals from being burdened with a large amount of debt. Many things influence the plan and rates of health insurance. However, with Wirefly, individuals just enters their ZIP code, and they will be presented with health insurance quotes. It is so simple.
Remember that the lowest cost is not always the best coverage for a person. If an individual intends to get married and have children in the future, they need to make sure they have covered for maternity bills. People should not just try to save money without getting the coverage they need. Health insurance coverage is not cheap, but it is better than having huge medical expenses. We can help find people the best insurance plans in Linneus, MO. We will get individuals quotes, so they can save money.

Prophetic vision reveals Bitcoin price drop followed by big rally.
April 24, 2018 8:15 PM By James Bailey 125 Comments
Following up on my post from February 10, I believe the vision I saw on February 7 regarding Bitcoin has nearly completed, which provides insights into what’s coming next. (see complete post)
In the vision, I saw a graph of Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). I was not shown the time frame of the chart, but I believe it was the daily chart because shorter time frames move too fast to measure significant changes in the market.
First, the RSI dropped steeply all the way to the bottom, then it moved back up steeply to the top, then straight down steeply to the bottom.
The RSI is a technical indicator used to chart the strength or weakness on a scale of 1 to 100. When it moves to the bottom, 30 or below, the market is oversold and likely to reverse as buyers take advantage of bargain prices. When it moves to the top, 70 or above, the market is overbought and likely to reverse as traders take profits by selling at the higher prices.
RSI can be measured in any time frame, daily, hourly, or even in increments of 1-minute, but longer time frames are generally considered more meaningful to traders.
The first move was fulfilled when the RSI dropped steeply, reaching the bottom at 30.14 on March 30. I was not shown any numbers, I just saw it dropping to the bottom of the purple area, as shown in the chart below, so I think 30.14 is close enough. The purple area extends from 30 to 70 because anything beyond these limits is generally considered oversold or overbought.
The second move was fulfilled when the RSI moved up steeply from the bottom, reaching the top today when Bitcoin’s price went up to $9,667, which is the highest it’s been since March 12. That’s a healthy 46% price increase since the RSI hit the bottom on March 30.
The graph below shows the fulfillment of the first two moves I saw. Click the chart to see a larger version.
Notice the fulfillment did not start immediately after I received the vision on February 7. There was about a six week delay before the RSI started dropping steeply on about March 20 and finally reached the bottom on March 30.
I have read many comments posted from skeptics accusing people of being false prophets because the fulfillment of their prophecies did not start immediately, but it rarely happens that way because God is revealing the future, not necessarily the next thing to happen.
Since the first two moves have now been fulfilled, I am expecting the final move to start soon, which means Bitcoin’s RSI should drop steeply all the way back to the bottom. I wasn’t shown any dates, but since it took about one month for the first two moves to complete, it seems reasonable to expect it to reach the bottom in a similar time frame, but we’ll see.
Two days ago, after briefly looking at the actual Bitcoin daily RSI, I saw another vision, which I immediately understood was showing Bitcoin’s future daily RSI. On the left side, it dropped far below 30, deep into the white area. Then it climbed to the top at about a 45-degree angle with a few bounces along the way and went far above 70, again far into the white area. I think this was showing a macro perspective of what’s coming.
Moving the daily RSI to the bottom or top requires significant moves in the price. Moving it far below the bottom or far above the top requires even greater moves in the price. Since that’s what I saw, I am expecting a big price drop coming soon for Bitcoin followed by a strong rally.
My guess is these two visions overlap with the upcoming drop from the first vision being the same drop that starts the second vision, but I can only speculate about that because I wasn’t shown any dates.
Prophetic dreams and visions provide helpful insights, but are limited because they only reveal partial information. I think it’s a mistake for anyone to make trading decisions based on this information without seeking specific confirmation and direction from God, so this is not a recommendation for investing.

Driving home out of Charlotte after work on the 85N is a fast paced HWY. Blazing past me on the right cutting in front of me is a van THE BIG GREEN EGG. Earlier in my way into work I ask Father if I should invest more into RDD.
Double down on RDD, I got a very surprising answer, so it would seem, you don’t see that every day, it was veryyyy humerous.
I do have a photo, but there seems to be complications loading photos here, at least for me.
My daughter is getting ready to go to China on a short mission, praise God, maybe this will fit in with the package.
Hoping this and the ETN mobil can be used for travel Missions.
Also, I followed that van for 30mls. never able to catch up to it.

funny how fast they drive! It took me at least 30km to catch up with the one I saw and then 3 attempts to take a photo as it pulled away so fast from the traffic light! LOL

The market movement in the past month makes me think of this dream from Christine. Interestingly, she had this dream on the 5th of April. The BTC low was about $6,600 (RDD at 57 satoshis) on that day, and since then we have trended upwards to a peak of about $9,750 on April 24th (and RDD 102 Satoshis on April 27th). In the week since that peak, we have declined slightly but remained fairly flat.
Could we be nearing the end of the restraining period? I don’t know, but it seems (according to this dream) that we are in a restrained period right now and that we have peaked until Jesus lets the bull go.
Perhaps that will be this weekend or soon after. I personally feel led to be heavily in RDD at the moment, and believe RDD will skyrocket before LTC does (which was my other largest holding). Only the Lord knows!
Just wanted to remind everyone of this dream from Christine and point out the market movement since then.
Thanks,
-Colton

Hi All,
Thankyou Z3 news and Chris Harris for your youtube videos that also brought me over to this great site!
So I’m seeing multiple 5s appear this week. I just saw my phone battery at 55 percent and the time was 5:55pm. This just happened before I made this post. My thought is that RDD could possibly Rocket up on the 5/5 for $5.
Cheers,
Glenn

Hi Colton, do you think it is still possible for bitcoin to go down. I mean, Christopher dreamt about it, words that say that RDD will blast off when everything is in red (pun aside). I am shorting BTC and in on a quite nice position. Looking to reinvest the profits from that (if happened) to RDD and to pay some of my bills (they are of small value). What do you think?

I personally think BTC will go down before it breaks $10k, maybe as far as $8k or under $7k…. but I don’t think RDD movements will be tied to BTC. The USD value of RDD may dip with BTC’s price…. but I don’t think the BTC/RDD ratio will drop very far (if at all). I would not try to tie the movements of BTC to RDD and I would not “wait” to invest in RDD because I was shorting BTC. Risk to reward scenarios don’t make sense. What possible return could you get shorting BTC that would come even close to riding RDD from $.01 to potentially $5, and in such a short timeframe? What has more prophetic confirmations? The risks in shorting BTC and waiting to buy RDD with profits are too high. What if BTC goes up? What if RDD goes up despite BTC going down? What if they both go up? What if you do make a profit shorting BTC but then have to pay twice as much per RDD as you could today? What if BTC doesn’t move at all and RDD takes off? What if you do short BTC but RDD volume is too high and you can’t execute a buy order or set a sell order? Just my opinion. I don’t know what you mean by “shorting” BTC, but what is more likely: the price of BTC dropping 20% down to the $7,000 range… or the price of RDD increasing 20%? Because RDD has been growing fantastically compared to BTC recently so I would bet on the RDD increase over the BTC decrease. And that would allow me to already be in RDD with my sell order set, so there is no way I can miss the RDD spike or fail to sell when… Read more »

My pleasure 🙂 I am a banker but not a financial advisor, so this is just my personal thought process. You may be able to time everything well, but only God knows the future. Seek Hm of course because He has a perfect plan for all of us!

I think that we will see everything in red when BTC fell very fast and everyone wants to get out of their altcoin positions. Just like what happened when it fell from $9800. But more violent and devastating.

Could it be that The Bull refers to Wall Street who have decided since Christine’s dream to get involved in Bitcoin. Indeed I have visited wall street and on it is the statue of the bull. The bull is the sign of Wall Street and is on Wall Street. Just an observation!

I’m sure that it could be. Christine just mentions “the market” in general so I think the bull represents the crypto market since that seems to be her interpretation as well. What causes the bull to go crazy? Certainly could be Wall Street and institutional investors, but the bull itself is likely crypto related. Even if Wall Street investors cause the bull to rise, that doesnt mean Wall Street becomes the bull itself. Wall Street could be part of the “why” but I don’t think Wall Street is the “what”. I think the crypto market (specifically the coins the Lords leads us to invest in) is the bull.
Just my thoughts on it.

Found this article proofing that the BTC market is regularly manipulated by whales with pumps and dumps. I would not be surprise if these are the same whales that manipulate the Gold and Silver markets.

Dear James, just to add my recent dreams here which supports what you saw I believe. I first had an $8,600 BTC target. Then I had a dream of seeing a big correction of the recent move from $6.5k and I saw it on the chart go through boxes which I believe were support levels (could be $7k and $6.5k) so potentially a move to 6k or so, followed by an enormous spike in BTC, seemingly double the previous large spike we had, I saw price moving up fast and saw LTC $195, but didn’t see any other numbers. After this I had a dream of me telling my friend BTC would go to $8.9-9.2k. I didn’t know exact figures but it was roughly this, and I didn’t know if this was the top (I mentioned that). We turned slightly at $8.9k but hit a top of $9.7k so far. We seem to be moving down now. After this dream I had a dream where I was going to buy at $8,000 and I woke up at exactly 8am. I had another dream the next night of seeing BTC dropping fast on a chart to $8,450 and again I was planning to buy at $8,000 and I felt led to. Yesterday I was praying about how much RDD I should hold and I received “investing” in RDD and saw a bowl with the words I felt “larger bowl” which to me seemed to indicate holding a larger amount of RDD. That is my plan for purchasing more RDD at $8k (I have some already). This might not be for others and for myself only, but just sharing. I’m not sure if the 8k is more significant, if there is a minor turning point before heading down further or not, and… Read more »

Hi Christopher, thanks for sharing brother! You planning to come hang with me in AZ yet? 🙂 My speculative interpretation: The move over $9,300 was fulfilled. Now we will continue to drop to $8,000 and might have a bounce upwards. I believe the bounce will be short-lived and the bears will continue to push BTC to $7,000 or below. BTC at $8,000 may be a good entry point for RDD (especially if RDD starts to moon this weekend) so perhaps you were instructed to buy at $8,000 because you’ll be buying RDD and it may start to break away from the downtrend, or it may be the last change to get into RDD safely before a spike. Perhaps RDD skyrockets while BTC continues the downtrend to $7,000 or below. If so, we could sell RDD and may have an opportunity to enter BTC/LTC at very low points and ride those up as well. Jessica’s dream of seeing the Bullwinkle antlers at $13,000 at the end of April (at least how I interpreted it – https://z3news.com/w/watching-super-fast-forwarding-movie/#comment-135433) could confirm a sharp huge move upwards from the low point of BTC under $7,000 which I know you have seen as well. Perhaps RDD spikes at $8,000 BTC price on the way down, the way up, or at a different time altogether. We will have a better idea as the weekend approaches to see what RDD and BTC are doing. It would be ideal to sell RDD into BTC into LTC (in my opinion) because if we see a strong breakout of LTC when BTC is at $11,300 then perhaps the $700+ LTC figures are coming. Only God knows! I would hope that we won’t miss the large LTC run while waiting for RDD, so (just my personal speculation) I bet RDD pops off… Read more »

Thank you Colton I really appreciate it. If the Lord leads me brother that’d be cool, I’ll send you an email though. God bless, Christopher. I just had a dream from the Lord and at the end of it credits were rolling with C&J (Chris and Jesus) in the background with a song from the Lord and seeing in the credits the white outline of missiles (Like I will be gone after/when they drop). Right before this a child received a “see you soon” fluffy toy in memory of their killed parent/loved one to comfort them. Also before the credits played I was trying to fight two men which were demons and I tried physically, I tried “the Lord rebuke you”, which they recoiled from some but it didn’t work and tried praying to God which they were still tormenting me through, it is only when I said JESUS! did they gasp and disappear and the credits rolled with the Lord’s song He sung me “love me maybe a little bit more then you will see, love me even more than you love me then I’ll be satisfied”. Was so amazing, just woke up thought I’d share. Christopher.

Dear brethren. As I was near waking up a vision popped into my mind. I saw RDD at 1.2 cents and it was up 50 %. Dream ended. This means it was 0.8 cents and it went up by 50% to 1.2 cents (I don’t know if it was 24 hrs or less). Perhaps that is where the bigger move up begins from 0.8 cents. We are currently lower than that at the moment. I think RDD is moving up soon. The 8k I received to buy may be it hasn’t moved by then and is one of the final buys at cheaper price. Not sure. Seems for the Lord to show me a smaller move like this is significant in some way. God bless.

This morning in a dream I saw $7,890 or so, I saw also RDD up 93% (I don’t know when), and something about ASIC mining chip FUD causing BTC/market to drive really low (I’m not sure but maybe it was in the 4k’s), I don’t know when this is. God bless, Christopher.

Just sharing that I don’t know when RDD is going to make that 50% and 93% move, it could be in the process of doing so now (up 23% so far), and the 8k shown to me may not be RDD related, and RDD could move independent from BTC. I don’t know as I don’t have enough to figure out for certain. Please seek the Lord and do what He guides you.

Given the timing we are nearing the time Christine believed RDD may move up, and I saw 50% and 93% moves in RDD, and that 8k could be coming later possibly after a move up first, I decided to move my funds in USDT into RDD. I realised the Lord isn’t giving me every piece of knowledge but some things, and I need to use prudence and wisdom to make decisions with what the Lord has given me. Given the upside in RDD, for me it’s better to be safe and be in. I’m still watching for the BTC correction to 8k, perhaps there is a good buy point for coins there (different options of the loaves of bread). I’ll be watching the 8k figure closely but for now have decided to be in. God bless.

Thanks for the update Christopher. I deal with the same issues in seeking to understand what God is revealing because we only see in part and know in part. I am learning to force myself to answer this question. Based on what God revealed, what do I know and what don’t I know? If I try to step out on what I think I know, I am striving in my own strength, trying to bring to pass what only God can bring about. The end result of all my striving only makes my situation worse, so all I can do is rest in Him and wait for Him to bring to pass the scenario He revealed. Then when I see it, I will know what to do.

Good decision, Christopher. It does not matter what price you enter RDD right now, as long as you get in before the 100 fold increase.
Your dreams about BTC are very helpful. Some of us need to get back into BTC and LTC on the next dip, before the final run up to $12k+ BTC and $650+ LTC.

IMPORTANT:
Dear Christopher Harris, there is news that the Mt. GOX trustee has move 16,000 BTC to Kraken. We do not know if he wants to dump, or if he wants to sell at a higher price, but the news might cause some panic dumping of BTC.
Also, if BTC has a PANIC DUMP to the $7k area, it will cause altcoins to panic dump even harder, including RDD, this is why you may get a better bargain of RDD if BTC dumps.
It is possible that RDD spikes while LTC and BTC are down. This might enable us to sell RDD and buy BTC and LTC before their final run up.
Also, the prophecies of exchange login issues do not occur with RDD, but with BTC and LTC, so this suggests that the BTC and LTC final run up occurs after RDD pumps this weekend.

If we look closely at the prophetic insights God has given us regarding Reddcoin, the dreams and visions have given us clues a move up is coming soon, but so far, none of them have included any dates, except John McCanada’s wife’s dream, but her dream did not mention Reddcoin. We’ve put forth our best efforts to put all the clues together to see when it might happen, but since we are making assumptions, it is possible our interpretations could be wrong. So, in the event Reddcoin does not move up this weekend, I think it would be wise to separate in our minds what God has revealed from what we have assumed it means because the part He has revealed is true, but the part about what we think it means is often wrong. The good news is our misunderstandings do not negate anything God has revealed, but it might mean we have to wait a little while longer. I am hoping no one will get discouraged and give up on the possibility.
For me, the most encouraging thing about the coming week is it is the week of the second chance Passover (based on Numbers 9:6-12) because God has a long history of delivering His people during Passover, including the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, three days after the start of Passover. God has not revealed to me anything about Reddcoin moving up during this Passover, but it’s an interesting possibility because it has scriptural precedent.

James, what you have said rings true with me. I believe the move will have the beginning this weekend but not necessarily go up all the way this weekend. My sell price I have been given has BTC a lot lower than it is now. I also had a dream on Friday which I only have realized it’s relevance. I was with an old boss of mine sitting down trying to put parts together. He is getting me to put it together for him. He then says we have to take it to grandma. I’m like ok. We then got in my white turbo coupe and drove partway up a hill. During the drive, I noticed a woman coming up behind me and it concerned me. I knew I had a gearbox issue in my car and didn’t want to damage anyone else’s car. My car suddenly had the problem and we stopped halfway up the hill. I told my boss to jump out and make sure we don’t hit the car behind. I had to get off the road and needed to roll back and knew that she was there. He said, “All clear.” So I rolled back, turning the wheel and went into a ditch. I then put the car back into gear and restarted the car, telling my boss we were good. We then continued to the top of the hill. We stopped and got out at a garage. There was one tow truck there, but no one to drive it. I had to wait. I told my boss I will have to pull out the gearbox and rebuild it as the synchros are done and need new ones. He says we could just crash it and get insurance. I say no, I don’t want to do… Read more »

Scotty I have some thoughts & thanks a lot for sharing please ya’ll keep it up!
It’s possible that the white vehicle represents the finances of the body of Christ, not necessarily silver. Because RDD, the hip coin now, repairs/restores our finances.
So we, or at least those of us involved in crypto I think, will go up (hill), down a bit (ditch reference), then consolidate/hold (inferred in dream by car stoppage). Then interesting that the manager is wise and loving, which I think is also a reference to Jesus’ body. Then RDD Reddcoin builds our vehicle, being finances, with RDD 1000 units at a time before reaching 10,000 total then our vehicle (finances) skyrocket! Not sure exactly what the units represent maybe just 10 increments (10k/1k) but I suppose up is still up, also many have the impression it will happen so fast.
So in summary it seems like move up (in whatever the body is invested in the dream), down a little, hold for some time then perhaps fast move up powered by RDD.

Thanks for sharing this dream Scotty. The colors sure fit the Reddcoin logo. This seems to confirm Christine Beadsworth’s dream about the kite moving up and down before releasing up, which I interpreted to mean the price would fluctuate up and down before finally moving way up. It sounds like we’re not quite there yet, but it’s coming.

Wow Scotty ! That is pretty awesome ! If indeed RDD reaches the $2-5 range when BTC is below 6k, that means we will be able to ride the BTC -LTC on their way back up…. which would indeed multiply our RDD profits !
I think Colton wrote something along those lines …. without precisely giving a BTC figure …but alluding to the fact that selling RDD when BTC is low would be a blessing to us!
Well God is Good !

Just an fYI the Lord has told me to put 90% of the ReDD profits (kingdom percent) into litecoin. That is where He wants it invested. I believe if the litecoin and BTC are low at that point then the ride up will even garnish that much more profit potential. Agree with this interpretation.

James, this is what the Holy Spirit is showing me but I don’t want to say this for everyone else as he will have a plan for them that is slightly different for all of us. We can’t all exit at the same price as this would create a plunge or major resistance level at the least. From what I can make of it from Friday’s dream, it started with me putting something together. I did not complete it fully though, so thinking this is a process build where we don’t see all of it but parts along the way. If we had the whole thing at the beginning it wouldn’t be a journey and there would be no continual seeking God which is what he seems to enjoy the most. I did have another dream with my White coupe during the week also with a Friend with red hair so it could be RDD also but I will see what happens with silver this week before I can make a judgement. It also had a start and stop with the Car. Then I climbed under it to fix the fuze box. Then my Red haired friend wanted to prank some people praying in the spirit that were up some stairs but I said not a good idea. I then see a 50 cent coin on a desk that is green and not silver. Next I then see a green grassy hill I have to walk up. This dream kind of fits my silver understanding but also doesn’t.

Thanks for explaining. The two spikes you saw seems to confirm some things others have seen. Maybe that’s why Christine Beadsworth was shown to sell at $2.22 while others were shown $5.00. If the first spike only goes up to $2.22 and then drops way back down, it would seem that would be the best place to sell because we could then buy more for the move up to $5.00. I am seeking God for more clarification and confirmation, especially regarding the second spike being 2 or 3 times bigger than the first.

Dear James Bailey, from my personal opinion, I am not really bothered whether RDD hits $2 or $5, because it is safer to put RDD sell orders slightly below $2.
It is safer to catch the lower price target, because it is possible to miss out on everything, if we aim too high.
I am more interested in BTC and LTC, because these can be traded on the Stock Market (I think they can be traded as ETFs, indices on a Forex account – forgive me if I use wrong terminology).
You can trade “the price” of BTC and LTC on some Forex accounts. These accounts have leveraged (margin) trades, so it is possible to make huge profits (but also huge losses).
People on this forum have forgotten about BTC, but are more focused on RDD.
I am much more interested at catching BTC and LTC at the lowest possible price, before the next Bull Run.

Dear Cunny Fred, please do the math and be careful : the RDD profits are MUCH more profitable than potential the LTC/ BTC profits….
When RDD moves from $0.20 to $2.00 thats a 1000 % increase (or ten fold ). To get the same increase with BTC , BTC would have to get to $ 90, 000 approx. This is pretty much impossible in a short time frame.
The potential gains with RDD are astronomical…. You should reconsider your RDD sell points.
The best scenario would be to sell RDD between $3 and $5 (knowing that $5 is probably the max we can get) and if BTC is then at the lower range ( $6 k to $8 k) potentially ride it up (BTC and LTC) to $12k and then sell them for USD or USDT before BTC crashes again. This way all the RDD profits are multiplied…. But if BTC is at $ 12 k when we sell RDD, then it is probably better to sell BTC for USD or USDT to preserve the Profits made from the RDD sales before BTC crashes again.
That’s my two cents.
Blessings.

Scotty,
Reading from other Z3ers, you may need to set the limit sell order for RDD urgently now. No body else get any revelation that when RDD’s spiking happen, BTC should be under 6k. I believe a lot of z3ers set their limit sell price between $2 to $5, while base price for BTC $8k-$9500, or they daily adjust their limit sell price according to the current BTC price. If you set limit sell price at $5, taking BTC base price at under $6k, ie 0.00083333btc, you may miss the RDD spiking if the spiking happen around BTC $8000-$9500. Sell price $5 , taking BTC base price at $9500, the selling price would be 0.00052632btc , much less than 0.00083333btc. If you don’t set any limit sell order, you may miss the spiking.

William, I have already put in a limit set order.
Like I said in my post with the dream it appears that there is more than one up. The initial up, then down, then a rebuild. The lady that kissed me said they were coming back after leaving. This is what makes me think there is two separate opportunities to sell. Possibly when BTC is high like now and one where BTC is lower. I have been shown three times now to not change my sell and exit early but to wait to be rescued, rebuilt, released from prison. I was very hesitant to post the dream as it doesn’t fit everyone else’s but I see that everyone has been given different sell prices so my dream showing two different moves could help alleviate any misconceptions as to why there are different sell prices.
hope this gives more understanding.

Interesting Scotty that you mentioned that there will be two separate opportunities to sell (represented by the lady in your dream stating she will come back …).
This reminds me of another dream by a Z3 member. If you recall it is the dream with Nicolas Cage and the lady who was screaming. If I recall, there were Two separate rescues ….which could be representing two different RDD moves….
Indeed if BTC goes down while RDD stays at the same level (RDD at same level in terms of US dollar value) , it becomes another “opportunity to sell “ at different ratio.
Interesting ! Thanks for sharing !

Thank for the post. I have put 10 scales of limit sell order between $2.22 and $5.00, taking $9100 as BTC base price. I perceive there are two waves up — I may be wrong. But for my own situation, as soon as my lowest price order be filled, I’ll have to draw some fund out to help my current cash flow. Good to hear that the Lord has given you the confirmations to keep your sell price.

Dear Scotty, we have 2 types of traders here:
– traders who want to sell RDD at the best price
– traders who want to pick up BTC and LTC at bargain price, to sell them near the top of the next run up.
It might be possible that RDD rockets before BTC dips, and that RDD stays at a relatively good price (possibly above $1) when BTC has the next correction, when it rebounds and even till BTC plunges down to $4k.
It is also possible that the RDD bull run begins slowly by Sunday evening, before picking up speed next week, while BTC dips and recovers.
This is just guess work

Dear Scotty, that is strange. I hope that you are not mixing the next temporary dip with the BTC plunge to $4k?
So far nobody else has given a clear figure of what the next plunge will be like, before the BTC run up to $12k.
Christopher Harris saw a deep plunge on a curve without numbers. Then he saw a BTC plunge dipping below to checkboxes on a chart. Then he saw BTC at $7130.
James Bailey had a recent BTC RSI revelation, when he saw the daily BTC RSI rapidly dip below 30 into the white area, then rise at 45 degree angle to above 70 into the white area.

CF, when I was shown my selling point I was show a graph of a stock that wasn’t BTC and the chart had two very large spikes in candle chart form. The first spike was significant, followed by one that was 2-3 times higher. I then heard a voice saying to sell the chart stock when another stock hits below $6000. The Chart I was shown was a reddish colour. red is usually down but in this case the candles were up. That was all that was in the dream. This led me to believe that something would go up while another would go down.
If anyone is trying to get the best price I will warn them that whoever puts in the price at the top will not get all their coins sold as tops are usually thin traded. Always leave some room for other traders to think they are getting a good buy themselves.
I’m thinking that the $1000 per sheet is 1000x increase. The $10k I am leaving to the Holy Spirit to reveal to others.
Anyone reading this should pray and not just make an assumption as mans reasoning is usually wrong. The Holy spirit reveals all and when you have peace in your spirit then go with that. God Bless.

It makes it very easy to play around with different price points and see what the effects are in USD and to change things up quickly. Very useful and helpful… Thank You

Colton, I would hope that during the RDD spike, when people sell RDD for BTC, the price of BTC will go up due to demand. I would also pray that BTC is going up during the spike to not lose value since this wealth transfer is for God’s purpose. So hopefully this price dip happens by Friday.

Christopher,
9200 -9400 was technically about the level I was looking for. You posted about seeing about 9200. It went higher than what you saw but does not mean you missed it. When BTC moves there is alot of action and that excitement can drive the price to spike.
The retrace will also be about what you were shown because now the big traders with stop loses will hit and the down trend will continue until the selling stops.
Your dreams are a true blessing brother so keep posting them.

Dear Christopher, could the various types of loaves of bread offered to you represent various alternate coins? When BTC drops to $8000 and then perhaps surge a little to $9000 plus, that could be an excellent time to buy some of the alternate coins like reddcoin that are ready to spike up. You did mention about seeing Rdd surging to $0.12 from $0.08 in a post below. Just my thoughts. God Bless.

Hi Christopher Harris, this is just maybe, the reason you buy RDD at BTC 8K is because RDD start going up from that price on.

I thought of that, and it could be. I’m basically thinking it’s based on my first dream (where I was going to buy at 8k as I believed the BTC price was going up), and we continue to move up from 8k possibly higher than 9k area towards a top of this run (the lower correction I saw coming after this), or the 8k might be RDD related, or it is personal to me for some reason. I’m siding with my first dream of the price going back up from near 8k. Because I am buying RDD at 8k possibly RDD may move up from there too.
Sorry I’ve been making a number of posts, sometimes my dreams are hard to figure out the sequence.
So far things are going roughly as I saw, with the price hitting 8.9-9.2k but going above, and now nearing the lower figure 8k. We could move up from 8k as I received several confirmations to buy then, but just know there can be different interpretations of things so please seek the Lord before following what I do necessarily.

Hi Chris if we are still thinking bitcoin hits 12,200 it could be from this 8000 run in bitcoin. Also maybe some alts do better not necessarily litecoin in this run. because if we are to hit $58USD in litecoin at $4850 in bitcoin litecoin still needs to break down from 0.016 to 0.012 bitcoin which isn’t much in the scheme of things.
I made a graph of how bitcoin might be going right now. Personally I’m still believing we are hitting $58 in litecoin before we hit the $800+ figures.

Update: regarding what I have seen the price at 8k and moving to 8k in BTC, I don’t know if the price moves up from here (I did mention this in my first dream of seeing 8k that I thought the price would move up in the dream so this could happen), or if its a minor bounce, or if we continue down for the more severe correction I saw at least to $7,130 and below. It is possible 8k is a turn around and we head up again, and the correction comes later. I don’t have enough information from what I’ve received yet to know. I am buying at 8k because the Lord showed me to, so it is possible this is a good buy point, and the correction is a bit later, or it is possible that only applies to me for some reason and we keep going down further.
I am sharing what I receive but please seek the Lord for understanding and confirmation and what you should do. It was a fairly stressful day seeing BTC go to 9.7k as I was thinking it could fulfill the previous dream I saw of seeing BTC move from 9.5 to 10.4k, but this didn’t happen and it seems that will happen later. When I mentioned my most recent dream I was unsure if it went all the way down or rebounded at 8k, I don’t know, I couldn’t tell. So in summary I believe we are heading to 8k, where we move from there is either up, a temporary rebound, or continue down to lower areas (possibly towards 6k) before the big spike up. God bless, Christopher.

Here is an insider.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp5o0cgB5uY
He claims that whales on crypto exchanges have been advised to BUY UP THE DIPS on LTC and to move crypto to private wallets. The scarcity of LTC (and BTC) on crypto exchanges will make it easier to pump the price at a later date with less trading volume:
Here is Warren Buffet slamming BTC again:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4ijrGUSYHM
Both links above indicate that there might be a further dip in crypto prices, so that the Elite can empty the exchanges of LTC and BTC, in anticipation of future rise in prices after the coming dump.

Here is a possible technical analysis that says a correction at or near 8k could be the fourth wave of this run, with a fifth wave up expected https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/QRGwGRSk-Possible-BTC-correction-target/ In my first dream I was buying at 8k because I thought the price was going up, I was excited about it in the dream. This could very well be the case. Just sharing this as a possible outcome as I don’t know when the lower correction will begin as I didn’t see the price at the top of the chart. I will update if I receive anything further. Please seek the Lord regarding what you should do.

This was the post on Z3 “Dream posted 22/4/2018 on Z3News “Just woke up at 8am. Right before I woke up I had a dream the price was $8001 or so and I was telling my friend it could go back up and she and I were excited about buying back in as we thought it may only be a correction so far with one more move up before going down. Dream ended.” I haven’t seen anything to negate a possible move up from 8k, as the correction I saw to the lower levels could be after this.

$8,000 is the most important support level. Once the price falls below $8,000 it is likely that the price will drop very fast to 6k area.
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/7gu3uYrW-BITCOIN-BULLS-Unstoppable-Unscrupulous-and-Unsatisfied/
It’s possible to see a bounce from $8,000. I don’t think that $8,000 will hold because then RSI will not drop to 30 line which James saw and you also saw BTC fall to 6.5-7k area. Also $6,500, $6,000, $4,900 are support levels.
Related to revealed numbers… I saw that it represents either an interval or are intermediate points. There are rare cases when the exact value is a turning point. I wanted to write this when BTC went to $11,750 and has not reached $12,000 so for me it’s not a surprise that now BTC hit a top of $9.7k although in your dream max. was 9.2k. I think it’s important for future trades. James saw RSI to 30 or below… it may go below 30 or to 30 or only to 35. I don’t know. The lesson: we must trade based on revelation however without seeking the maximum profit.
I might be wrong so please seek God for confirmation.

I understand. You did Fibonacci retracement considering 0% for 9644 high and 100% for 6434 low. From experience I know that the best results occur when Fibonacci retracement overlap with the previous support and resistance levels. In our case 78.6% (7121) and 100% (6434) are also previous support and resistance levels and most important are in the 6.5-7k are that Christopher saw.

Thanks Ed, and Robert I don’t know if we will bounce near 8k. My most recent dream it seemed like we may have gone all the way down. As I said before I don’t know the figures on how far we go down, but it was through two supports and seemed to retrace the entire recent move up. 8k could be something for just me but I did have it mentioned a few times so there could be a bounce or I’m not sure about it. I’m mostly looking to buy more RDD at 8k area, not sure if that has significance. Don’t necessarily follow what I’m doing because it may go all the way down without bouncing, and the Lord could be directing me for a certain reason.
With regard to not getting the exact figures this is fine since the dream I received I wasn’t told it was the top, nor did I see a turning point so I didn’t necessarily assume it was the top. It wasn’t too far off though. I have seen $7,130 so we will drop to at least that, potentially further though. 8k I’m not sure what it’s about other than I’ve been directed to buy back in. The move up after this coming correction is going to be huge though. God bless, Christopher.

Dear Christopher Harris, you do not need to get the exact figure that everybody wants to see. You mentioned $8.9k – $9.2k. We understand that different exchanges may have slightly different prices.
Even though BTC hit $9.7k in this run up, we are now currently at $8.9k. Today, BTC has seen $9.7k and $8.8k, so your description of $8.9k – $9.2k is fairly accurate, because these figure come flashing to you in a dream.
Please continue to give us prophetic information whenever you get it. These revelations are not for the faint of heart, but for mature minds that are willing to digest the information.

Correction: regarding my mention of the recent dream of the price potentially going all the way down, it was unclear what I was seeing and it was not really usable information. I only mentioned it as a maybe but I shouldn’t have as it wasn’t clear enough and could have been something different, my apologies. I’m back to my earlier dream of thinking we may move up from 8k area before the drop to the lower levels I saw.

Dear Christopher Harris, God is telling you to sell BTC at $8k, possibly because you might get the lowest RDD price at that time.
For example, RDD might be 0.00000080 BTC when BTC is $8k, but RDD price might spike to 0.00000800 BTC when BTC dips further to $6.5k+
This is just an example.
Your dream does not say that $8k is the bottom of the dip before the bull run, but the information does suggest that BTC at $8k might be the price when you get the best bargain for RDD.
This is just food for thought.

Hi Christopher I wanted to remind you of 3 dreams you have had and how they might play out, This dream I feel could be relevant for today as it is April 30 and you were woken up at 4:30am “This morning I woke up 22/3/2018 at 4:30 am (it’s now 12:30pm), and I wrote down a dream I had…I was seeing it around the $9,200 area move to $9,500 then hover around here then when I checked again the price was $10,400 or so. The atmosphere felt bullish…I heard “there’s going to be a lot of noise tomorrow” (It felt like it was related to the run in prices. I did see LTC at $210 area.” My interpretation is we go to 10,400 today or tomorrow and then the noise is we start dropping. The second is this one “Had a dream last night I thought I’d share. In the dream I saw someone on a basketball court maybe at the freethrow line and he shot and it went in the hoop. This may have happened twice. I felt it was crypto related and it felt it had to do with BTC and LTC and that I should remember I had it.” I originally thought it would mean we went up 2k in bitcoin as two penalty shots from free throw line are worth 1 point each, but it may have just been normal basketball shots which are worth 2 points each meaning we could go up 4k in bitcoin before a fall from where you received this dream… This would be a confirmation of the 10,400 maybe a bit higher in the original dream… The third I thought was interesting is “Just woke up at 8am. Right before I woke up I had a dream the price was… Read more »

Z3ers,
on 4/13/18, Jessica L. had a dream about her cousin April preparing food and the actor who portrayed Joey in Full House was imitating Bullwinkle and holding antlers that he would sell online for $13,000.
https://z3news.com/w/watching-super-fast-forwarding-movie/#comment-135433
Could this indicate that in May, BTC will reach its next peak around $13 K, with associated high LTC prices? The meaning of Joey in English is an abbreviation of Joseph. In Hebrew, it means “May Jehovah add/give increase.”
http://www.sheknows.com/baby-names/name/joey
Bullwinkle is a moose and an immature moose can shed its antlers until Spring.
Mary Conwell was told to use 90% of RDD profits to buy LTC. We need more prayer and revelation to know if BTC will go up and above the previous peak around $9767 and hit Christopher’s BTC price at $10,400, then up to 13 K (what I would consider a second peak), or go down for another major bottom to or below Christopher’s 6.5 to 7 K and then go to 13 K and high LTC prices. God bless.

I wanted to share a few exchanges. It’s good to diversify to keep your options open and if some of these prophetic targets are met it’s going to be difficult to unload crypto/fiat and re-invest it due to deposit/withdrawal limits. Here are a few to look into…
https://www.kucoin.com/
Kucoin has ETN Electroneum at close volume to cryptopia but looks way better
https://www.kraken.com/
great general exchange in the Bay Area and can do fiat, crypto margin/shorting.
https://gemini.com/
USD! Also BTC/ETH
Binance Chinese exchange that accepts USA, great for Tron TRX
https://www.binance.com/?ref=15706916
The following 3 you can buy crypto with credit cards but be careful because buying crypto usually counts as “cash advance” with fees and interest. I think with these first 2 you can also exchange cryptos easily.
https://buybitcoin.shapeshift.io/
buy btc with credit card RDD!, BTC, LTC MANY cryptos
https://changelly.com/
USD VISA MASTERCARD
ETH XMR ZEC DASH XRP ETC LTC DOGE USD BTC
https://www.bitstamp.net/
I’ve heard good things about this exchange in luxembourg which accepts USA and fiat and credit card. I haven’t tried any wires or anything yet however.
https://coinmarketcap.com/
This is a great website for looking up exchanges for specific coins.
If you recommend anymore non-obvious ones (ie coinbase/gdax) please chime in!

Hello Renee. You had a great dream with the importance of 8/25/18. I believe something important is going to happen then, but there is a very likely chance that it has nothing to do with BTC, since you were not told directly it had to do with BTC. So many times we (as in I) get a date or interpret a date and it was not what we thought. I do think that BTC will be really down in August, and could be related to this date, but unless the Spirit directly says so, I would rather think that it is important for some other reason. God bless.

James, here is some BTC data from looking at BTC RSI 1 year scale of Bitfinex on tradingview.com, starting from 7/16/17:
1. From 4 bottoms in RSI from 7/16/17 to 2/5/18, there are 2 major RSI peaks that occurred after each bottom. The first RSI peak occurred 25 to 30 days after the RSI bottom.
Therefore, I am expecting the first RSI peak within April 24 to 29, which is 25 to 30 days from the last RSI bottom on 3/30/18.
2. BTC RSI peaks of each pair occurred on 8/14/17 and 9/1/17, 10/14/17 and 11/4/17, 12/7/17 and 12/16/17, 2/17/18 and 3/4/18.
After each RSI peak, the price peak occurred 1 to 3 days later, with one exception in which the price peak occurred 1 day before the RSI peak.
3. From the first RSI peak of each pair, there were 3 to 8 days to the intermediate bottom price, the bottom before the second RSI peak.
4. The second RSI peak of each pair occurred 9 to 21 days after the first RSI peak.
5. the first BTC price peak of first pair was on 8/17/17 at $4492 and dropped to the bottom between the peak price pair on 8/22/17 at $3599. This was a 19.88% drop. The 10/13/17 peak of $5920 dropped to 10/18/17 at $5114; a 13.61% drop. The 12/8/17 price of $17,171 dropped to $12,730 on 12/10/17; a 25.86% drop. The 2/20/18 price of $11,788 dropped to $9280 on 2/25/18; a 21.28% drop.
Therefore, I am expecting a 13.6% to 25.9% drop in price from the next price peak.
6. With the slight exception of one pair of peak prices, the second price peak was higher than the first price peak.
We’ll see how this pattern holds up or deviates significantly into the future. God bless.

Addendum:
7. From the 5 previous major RSI bottoms, the bottom in BTC price occurred within 3 days after RSI bottom.
Update:
So far, it looks like BTC RSI reached its first of two major peaks on April 24 and hit the pattern for April 24 to 29. The BTC price peak hit $9767.4, on Bitfinex using tradingview.com, today on April 25, which hit the pattern for 1 to 3 days after RSI peak. The intermediate price bottom is expected to go 13.6 to 25.9% down, so in the $7237 to $8439 range. This would hit Christopher’s numbers. God bless.

BTC Update 3:
The expected range of the intermediate price bottom was expected within April 27 to May 2, from $7237 to $8439. It came 1 calendar day early on April 26 at $8661.6 (11.3% drop from 1st peak at $9767.4). This new data will be added and patterns adjusted.
3a. From the first RSI peak of each pair, there were 2 to 8 days to the intermediate price bottom, the bottom before the second RSI peak.
5a. From the 1st peak of BTC price to the intermediate price bottom, there was an 11.3% to 25.9% drop.
8. From previous 4 sets of intermediate price bottoms to 2nd price peaks, there was a 26.07 to 56.25% increase.
From pattern #4 above, the 2nd RSI peak is expected to be within May 3 to 15.
From pattern #8, the 2nd price peak is expected to be within $10,919 to $13,534.
These are the historical patterns, but future patterns change. God bless.

BTC Update 4:
Given that this last intermediate price bottom was down only 11.3%, to be more in proportion to previous 2nd peaks, I would expect the next 2nd price peak to come in below $10,919, or closer to it than $13,534. Only God knows. Let’s keep praying. God bless.

BTC Update 5:
The 2nd RSI peak on 5/5/18 fit the historical pattern, #4 above. The 2nd price peak on 5/5/18 also fell within the previous historical range of -1 to 3 calendar days after the RSI peak. On Bitfinex, the 2nd BTC peak was $9990 and was below the historical range of pattern #8, but proportional to 1st price peak and intermediate price bottom. It is not clear what is the basis for proportionality. There is a somewhat symmetric “W” or “M” pattern, but with the 2nd price peak usually a little higher than the 1st price peak. It looks like BTC is heading now to a level below RSI 50 and near or below RSI 30 for the start of another cycle. God bless.
