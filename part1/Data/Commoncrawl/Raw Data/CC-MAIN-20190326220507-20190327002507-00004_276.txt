Pennsylvania to Vote in Primaries This Tuesday
Posted on April 24, 2016 by reformfaanow@gmail.com	
(click on image to view tweet with short video clip)
Flooding at La Guardia Airport caused by Hurricane Sandy, in 2012.
Today is the last Sunday before the presidential primaries in five key states, including Pennsylvania. I ran across a tweet with a short video clip at a Bernie Sanders rally, and a speaker noting that climate change will cause the airport at Philadelphia to become flooded. I have thoroughly studied airports across the nation, and have blogged before about flooding risks impacting Florida as well as LaGuardia and other major airports. But, until hearing this Bernie 2016 speaker, I had always assumed the Philly airport was at a safer and higher elevation. So, I looked up the data; the speaker was absolutely correct.
The major hub airport at Philadelphia [KPHL] is on the north bank of the Delaware River, not far from the northern tip of the Chesapeake Bay. A look at the Airport Diagram shows that all four KPHL runways are very vulnerable to flooding; low points on each of the four runways are between 8-ft MSL and 10-ft MSL. While FAA is spending billions to further overdevelop KPHL, we are ignoring the risks of flooding, which grow greater each year. All to subsidize airline profits and prop up wasteful airport programs and corrupt incumbent politicians.
(four low elevations marked with yellow boxes)
Pennsylvania gets to vote in the primaries this week. We have endured too many decades of top-down control by the two major parties, and the balance continues to tip toward expanding the wealth gap, enriching elected officials (like the Clintons), all while a full-blown oligarchy is setting in. We need real and rational change, and it is more easily done now than later.
There is only one candidate who accepts the real threat to our planet caused by our excessive consumption of fossil fuels. There is only one candidate who is not beholden to money interests such as the fossil fuel industry, the Av-Gov complex, the banks, pharma, etc. There is only one candidate demanding an end to our corrupt ‘pay-to-play’ politics … demanding real reforms so we have effective governance that is transparent and accountable. That candidate is Bernie Sanders.

Heres A Great Way To Organize Your Work From Home Office Virtually
Heres A Great Way To Organize Your Work From Home Office Virtually
How to do keep track of all you have to do on a daily basis? How about things that have to get done this week?.. How about for the month? I used to be a pen and paper guy..everything I had to get done was written (notes) in the yellow pad that sits in front of me. It still sits there, but it's not used as much, except for when I'm taking notes when on the phone.
A couple years ago David Ledoux, my mentor and boss introduced me to Yahoo Calendar. Do you use Yahoo Calendar? David has a very busy schedule and is constantly traveling, so he needed a way of keeping track of all that he had to do in a format that he could access from anywhere globally. Something (unlike a PDA or note book) that couldn't get lost, stolen or need charging.
I took David's advice and got a free membership to the yahoo service and have been using it ever since. It allows me to plan my entire month..even year!.. It's like a total planner, but virtual. I can enter things I have to do down to the minute and when it's time to get that task done I get a reminder notice on my computer letting me know that I have something planned.
It's Not only a planner...
Along with the great planning capabilities, I also have access to my email and my entire list of contacts. PLUS.. I can give people access to my planner to see how my schedule is.
What are you waiting on..get a Yahoo account, it's free and makes time management a breeze.
Enjoy all the benefits of Yahoo! Calendar.
Access dates and meetings from anywhere, anytime.
Share your calendar with specific friends and co-workers.
Remember important dates, set up automatic reminders.
Regards
Chris

Description
15? when that place opened in 1980. I was VERY impressed . Perhaps I was merely impressionable, wrote Star Reader. But there are similarities. Both men had parents with successful athletic careers of their own. Both frequently divert credit to those parents. Remember, if you want to film anyone under the age of 18, you must get permission from their parent or guardian. If you are filming at school, in school time, this permission can be given by the head teacher.Where Where is the story happening, and where is the best place to film? If you’re shooting outside of school, you may need to get permission first.When Has the story already happened, or is it about to happen? If there’s going to be a significant event you want to report on, make sure you get there on time!By planning each of these points in detail, you’ll know exactly what you need to film,, where and when.A basic TV news report is made up of five parts:Introduction This is where the reporter starts to explain the story. Don’t make it too long,, keep it short and snappy.First interview The first person you talk to will give their opinion on what is happening, and how it affects them.Second interview You need to talk to someone with a different opinion, to provide balance.Extra shots These show the audience more about the place and the people in the story. You need to have good physical and mental health. Of course there are different variations of what one might consider mental healthiness, and some may feel that you need to be a little crazy to do this type of flying. The point here is that you most certainly do not want to black out, even for a short time, while in flight. Already, drug makers are going overseas to emerging markets such as China and India, selling what they call established pharmaceuticals or “branded” generics. Pfizer and Abbott are among those companies making more money on older medications,, a sweet spot for companies like Walgreen and Boots that sell generics to price sensitive consumers. Business expanding to Europe where Alliance Boots is strong and the economies are shaky.. “One of the main pillars of my campaign is to repeal and replace Obamacare with real health care reform that will lower costs and increase access to care. As plan administrator of the self insured health plan at our family’s business, I’ve seen first hand the disastrous effects Obamacare will have on health care in our country. The fundamental point here is that socialism doesn’t work, but consumerism does.”.

Not Small Differences
November 6, 2018 Barry 1 Comment
ShareTweet
I joined the Army (the Army Reserve actually) during my junior year of high-school. I had to gain the permission of my parents and I looked a little silly returning my senior year with my basic training haircut. This began a journey that ended this year in an active duty retirement and many exciting and fulfilling years in between. I knew from the time I was a small child that I wanted a career in the military but in 1983 a speech by Ronald Reagan gave me cause to join as soon as I turned 17 two years later.
On the night of this “blue wave” election night I am reminded of that Evil Empire speech and what it meant to me then and what it should mean to our nation. Watch it if you have forgotten Reagan’s words concerning Godless communism – the very sort on the ballot tonight.
In my adult life, I cannot recall a single good president, not one since Reagan. Some were clowns, others disgusting fools, or slick snake oil salesmen but none have been statesmen and none have led us toward the ideal of traditional Americanism in the way Reagan did.
Congress and the Senate have certainly been no better, in point of fact much worse. In terms of general trends, we have moved much closer to socialism and away from the traditional American values of family, self-reliance, work and Christianity. Democrats, particularly the loudest of them, the ones that like to shout down anyone that disagrees with them, may not admit they have been winning but the facts are fairly self-evident to support this truth. Regulation has increased in the aggregate, personal freedom has decreased., the size of government has increased and traditional Christian values have been eradicated from public life – communism, err progressivism, has been winning.
In our system, we generally perceive mid-term elections as a way to alleviate buyer’s regret from the proceeding presidential election. This is generally why the party of sitting presidents lose control of the House of Representatives during mid-term elections.
To utilize a millennial term, this year feels different.
Donald Trump is different. He is the physical manifestation of a lot of frustration that has built up in conservative-minded Americans since 1988. Bush I was a company man. Bush II was overwhelmed and unprepared for the circumstances he found himself in – he did more damage than good. Conservatives have suffered for years under inept Republican presidents and two Democrats that did irreparable damage to the nation. A man, Trump, that spoke in ways that are common and to the point was the result.
Many of the Democratic offerings in this election are the left equivalent of a Donald Trump. If Democrats believe Trump to be despicable they have responded by selecting outright socialist and proto-communist. Spin it as you will, call it progressive, “compassionate” open-minded or any other euphemism many of these folks believe in tenets of Marxism.
We have perhaps crossed the Rubicon of civility, respect and cooperation and it is likely undeniable that there is a great gulf in what the far right and far left believe America is supposed to be.
If a mid-term election is supposed to be a safety-valve, something that allows the electorate to blow off steam, how does this continue to work when the poles are so far separated. The ideologies and philosophy that now separates us are not small differences.
Will the most radical of the left be satiated with a blue wave, what about a blue ripple? What happens if there is no blue wave at all and outright radical socialist like Abrams and Gillum lose, what with the most radicalized of the left do? What if the Democrats fail to even gain the House? Will the most radical of the left stop protesting in the streets of the Pacific Northwest and go get jobs like the rest of us or will the blue wave morph into something else?
Only time will tell.

SID PENALTY TCU was called for a sideline interference penalty on Johnson’s overtime interception when sports information director Mark Cohen stepped onto the field to celebrate. The average seat pitch, a rough measure of legroom, has shrunk from 35 inches in the 1970s to about 31 inches today. During the weeks following his addition to our DotA 2 roster, we faced chemistry issues. After Wales’ friendly defeat to Albania this week, posted a clip Alejandro Villanueva Jersey of Bale defending in the right-back position and allowing Wholesale NFL Jerseys China a pass to get past him. If the Chargers can win this week while the Chiefs are on their bye, though, then they trail by only a game with a head-to-head game left. • Named to the All-NBA Team seven times…
No Obligation. Here’s a look at each Central Division team’s prospect pool heading into the 2018 MLB Jerseys Usa NHL season, including the top players in the system.
Jean Segura is hitting .340 this year and he has an on-base percentage of .361.
Teams are hitting .252 against the Mets bullpen. The Whites MLB Jerseys Usa boast 11 all-time Champions League titles, four more than any other club . They’ve had 367 men left on base and have an OPS of .774. Behind the arc they shoot 36% which is good for 110th in D-1. Per the Corsica Hockey website, last season, Hagelin was among the team leaders in driving possession with a Corsi For MLB Jerseys Usa % of 54.
Many have cited Schremp’s inability to adapt his junior game to the NHL. Pageau scored a goal in Sunday’s 5 loss to the Hurricanes. Winslow still hasn’t participated in a full 5-on-5 practice and has been wearing a brace for several weeks. Whitt finished http://www.steelersnflofficialproshop.com/WOMENS_YOUTH_ALEJANDRO_VILLANUEVA_JERSEY.html with 18 points on 9-of-10 shooting for SMU . CB Johnathan Joseph Without a doubt. Throughout the season, any time this team gets on an under run, I would look to find value on the over as the numbers get adjusted downward. Louis Blues, the biggest single move without question was the trade that sent five assets to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for veteran center Ryan O’Reilly. The Ragin’ Cajuns are against the spread and their over under record is . It’s going to be a fun time for our group to grow Wholesale Jerseys All and take that next step, Nashville center said. It wasn’t a sharp game for us. His 54 assists led all Guelph Storm players.
2 Matt Moore is likely going to need Tommy http://www.officialauthenticgiantsprostore.com/Nike-Evan-Engram-Jersey.html John surgery. The Horned Frogs ran for 160 yards on 34 attempts. Even with the early money bringing this line down quite a bit, I still believe it is high enough to cash in on Cheap NBA Jerseys a play on the under. The entire world-including, until only recently, Cheap NBA Jerseys America-decided that vehicle emissions were not only an issue but a solvable one; car companies reacted with a flurry of innovation, pulling more from less: higher Wholesale Jerseys All output Darren Fells Jersey from lower displacement; higher mileage with fewer emissions. Rahyme Johnson saw the entire play: Josh Woods going to scoop a fumble, a teammate rolling into the senior linebacker’s knee and the way Woods remained on the Spaulding Field turf after the hit. One you might consider is a SIMPLE IRA, which, as of 2019, allows you to contribute up to $13 per year if you’re under 50, or $16 per year if you’re 50 or older. We want to play action it, we also want to drop back in the empty game, we want to be able to throw it around the ball park, but also we want to be physical, and we want to be able to run the ball downhill. Saunders is a former writer for NBC Sports’ , where he was a NFL draft writer for two years. Andersen, who is with a 2 goals-against average, a .923 save percentage and one shutout, said the groin injury was a slow, gradual buildup of wear and tear that did not Wholesale NFL Jerseys China improve leading up to the Christmas break.

EWG News Roundup (7/27): Carcinogenic TCE in Tap Water, Food Additives to Avoid and More
In the News
By Robert Coleman, Project Manager
Friday, July 27, 2018
This week, EWG published a report and interactive map showing that the notorious “A Civil Action” chemical trichloroethylene, or TCE, pollutes the tap water supplies of 14 million Americans. TCE is a particularly harmful contaminant for children, with links to birth defects; damage to the brain, and the nervous, reproductive and immune systems; and increased risk of cancer.
“People whose water contains TCE can be exposed not just by drinking it, but also by inhaling it while bathing, washing dishes and doing other household activities,” said Tasha Stoiber, Ph.D., a senior scientist at EWG. “Communities across the country have water with potentially harmful levels of this toxic solvent, but many people don’t know about the risk they face when they turn on the tap.”
EWG also applauded the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Environmental Health for publishing a new study warning of the risks chemical food additives pose to children’s health. On our new children’s health site, we counted down the top five food additives that all parents should avoid.
Over on the Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce™ site, we took a deep dive on neonicotinoid pesticides, which are banned in Europe, but still appear on American produce.
For coverage on these developments and more, here’s some news you can use going into the weekend.
TCE in Water
Fast Company: 14 million Americans are drinking carcinogen-polluted tap water
The drinking water of some 14 million Americans is contaminated with a cancer-causing industrial solvent called Trichloroethylene, or TCE, according to a new EWG analysis of tests from public utilities nationwide. EWG’s Tap Water Database, which aggregates test results from utilities nationwide, shows that in about half of the systems it monitors, average annual levels of TCE were above what some health authorities say is safe for infants and developing fetuses.

Delhi Greens: Cancer Causing TCE Tap Water Threatens the Health of 14 Million Americans
A recent analysis of water supply in United States by the Environmental Working Group has found that tap water supplies to more than 14 million Americans is contaminated with a cancer-causing industrial solvent TCE. TCE or trichloroethylene is linked to liver and kidney damage, and to cancers like leukemia. It has also been linked to birth defects, though the EWG fears that the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will attempt to downplay important evidence that TCE exposure causes heart defects in developing fetuses.
Neonicotinoid Pesticides
Organic Authority: Bee-Killing Pesticides Found in Half of U.S. Produce Samples
A new analysis from the Environmental Working Group finds residues of at least one of three EU-banned neonicotinoid pesticides – imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam — on more than half of samples of potatoes, lettuce, and spinach tested between 2015-2016. More than a quarter of cherries, watermelons, and strawberries also tested positive for the chemicals.

The cover photo of this episode was taken in 1980, but no one could have imagined that on December 8 of that year Yoko Ono would become a widow and the world would never recover from the murder of one of its greatest musicians and peace activist . Shortly before John Lennon’s murder, he resumed his songwriting career following a break as househusband and caretaker to their son Sean. Their “Double Fantasy” album was in the works and was released just three weeks before his cold-blooded killing in front of his apartment house-The Dakota-in New York City. The album gave us such memorable songs as “Woman,” and “(Just like) Starting Over.”
Yoko Ono was known as”The woman who broke up The Beatles.” John insisted on her attending the recording sessions that had been off limits to girlfriends and wives. …

PODCAST EPISODE 12 – Well, Hello, Dolly!
By celebrityarchaeologyHome
﻿
Well, Hello Dolly!
This episode photo of bootylicious Dolly Parton was taken in 1978. The five foot tall singer, songwriter and actress with the hourglass figure and big bouffant hair has been churning out hits for decades.
“I like the big hair and the gaudy clothes. I’ve never thought of myself as being a sex symbol and I don’t want to have to be a beautiful woman, like Raquel Welch.
‘I want people to know it’s me when they see me coming and when they see me leavin’… ‘so I figured
I might as well look even more extreme,'” she said in an interview.”
The New Yorker described her voice as “baby-high soprano.” It can be heard on such hits as “Jolene” and “Here You Come Again,” which earned Dolly her first Grammy Award.
In 1983, she wrote and recorded “I Will Always Love You” about her professional split with country legend Porter Wagoner. They were a successful vocal duo who recorded such songs as “The Last Thing On My Mind,” and “Please, Don’t Stop Loving Me.”
In 1992, Dolly’s “I Will Always Love You” would be recorded again but by Whitney Houston for the soundtrack “The Bodyguard.” It would turn out to be one of the best-selling singles of all time.”
When asked what she did with all of the profit from that song she said she just went out and bought more wigs!
Dolly has appeared on the screen in a list of duds but also had some great success with “Steel Magnolias,” and “9 to 5” which she (again) wrote and recorded the theme song.
Dolly was born into poverty on January19, 1946 in Sevierville, Tennessee.
Her childhood home in the Great Smokey Mountains was a log cabin with no running water or electricity. She was one of 12 children born to her tobacco farmer father and her mother who was a housewife. She was also the first in her family to graduate from high school.
At age seven, Dolly started strumming on a homemade guitar and at age 10, she began performing in local TV shows and radio in Knoxville.
To this day, she says her most favorite song is “A Coat of Many Colors,” which she wrote and recorded in 1971. The song tells how her mother stitched a colorful coat for her out of rags.
“…nothing is as precious as my mama’s memory and my coat of many colors that she made for me.”
In the beginning of her career, Dolly began churning out songs for other country artists such as Hank Williams, Jr. and Kitty Wells. She has composed over 3,000 songs to date and her worth is over $600 million. This is thanks to her early decision to publish her own music, concerts and royalties. She also has “Dollywood Theme Park” in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee which attracts over 2.1 million visitors a year.
Dolly has been married to the “mysterious” Carl Dean since 1966. They met at a Nashville laundromat called “The Wishy Washy.”
“He’s very private and I’ve always respected that for him and about him,” she said.
However, Dolly shocked her fans when she said she is in an open marriage. She revealed in an interview that she contemplated suicide over a failed love affair. She later took a step back and said there were no sexual relations in her other affairs.
There have been rumors for years that Dolly was in a relationship with her assistant and childhood friend Judy Ogle which she has vehemently denied.
Dolly is a well-known philanthropist who has donated more than 10 million books annually to improve child literacy through her Dollywood Foundation.

PODCAST EPISODE 11 – A Prodigy Named Michael Jackson
By celebrityarchaeologyHome
﻿
This episode photo of Michael Jackson, taken at 19, in 1980 before he became the “King of Pop.” The adorable teen idol, who grew up before our eyes as a member of the Jackson 5, would continue to be embedded in pop culture history throughout his life.
Born in Gary, Indiana, he began performing with his brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon as “The Jackson 5”.
When Motown got wind of the brothers they were signed to a recording contract where they popped out four number one singles in a row including “I Want You Back” (1969) ,” ABC “(1970) , “The Love You Save “(1970), and ” I’ll be There “(1970) But it was young Michael who emerged as the headliner of the group.
Rolling Stone magazine called the child performer “a prodigy.” It was at this early stage that Michael began taking on the songwriting duties for the group. He began a solo career in 1971 but in the 1980s had reunited and toured again with his brothers. in 1982, he recorded the album “Thriller.”
To this day, it is the best selling album of all time! His performance in 1983 for “Motown 26: Yesterday, Today, Forever ” garnered 47 million viewers and is rated up there with “The Beatles” U.S. debut on Ed Sullivan. Music producer Barry Gordy said of it, “From the first beat of ‘Billie Jean,” I was mesmerized.”
It was after Michael introduce his famous Moonwalk choreography that “Michael Jackson went into orbit and never came down, ” Gordy said. Not satisfied with his already great looking appearance, Michael’s face changed along with his career. His skin tone became paler. He attributed it to a skin condition called vitiligo. Others claimed he was bleaching his skin to appear whiter. The metamorphosis of his face resulted in him looking like a pixieish character. Michael only admitted to two rhinoplasties and a dimple which was created in his chin. His strange lifestyle earned him such titles as “Wacko Jacko.”
He seemed to play with the press when he carried around his pet chimp Bubbles, offered photos of himself sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber to the tabloids and went on a date with both Brooke Shields and little actor Emmanuel Lewis. Michael’s personal life made front page news when The King of Pop married Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of the King of Rock ‘n Roll Elvis Presley. ‘Yes, I started falling for him,’ she explained. ‘I wanted to help him, and I felt that I could.’ As he fell further into drug addiction, she stood by him.
One night, during one of their phone calls, he wanted to know how she would respond if he asked her to marry him. Without hesitation, she replied:”I would do it.” The marriage would last less than 2 years. Yearning for children, he moved on to a nurse from his dermatologist’s office. Debbie Rowe provided him with two children-Prince Michael Jackson and Paris Jackson. After their quick divorce, she turned the kids over to him as planned.
It is still up in the air as to whether Michael fathered the kids. Rumors are that that distinction belonged to Dr. Arnold Klein, his dermatologist. Michael appeared with a third child (parentage unknown) which he nicked named “Blanket.” Blanket’s legal name is Prince Michael Jackson II.
There was backlash after a famous scene where he laughed and dangled Blanket over a hotel balcony while everyone below looked in horror. Important to mention is the charitable Michael who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998 and 2003. In 2000, he was included in the Guinness Book of Records as a pop star who supported the biggest number of charity organizations (39 at the time). A 1988 autobiography spoke of his lost childhood and physical abuse at the hands of his father, Joe.
Jackson’s questionable attraction to children and his purchase of “Neverland” ranch where he would entertain them took on an ugly tone. In 1993, he was accused of child sexual abuse but it was settled out of court. In 2005, he had a trial for similar charges but was tried and acquitted of more sexual abuse allegations.
Viewers were glued to the TV watching the strange comings and goings including Jackson showing up in pajamas and his “umbrella man” assistant escorting him to the courthouse. The jury found him “not guilty” on all charges.
Ready for a comeback, Jackson prepared for his final “This is It” tour. But “This is it” would turn out to be really it for him. On June 25, 2009, before making even one stop on tour, he died after suffering cardiac arrest.
The coroner said he had acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, was charged with involuntary manslaughter in his death. Michael Jackson’s longevity continues to this day. Forbes magazine ranked him the top-earning deceased celebrity for 2017.

PODCAST EPISODE 10 – How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?
By celebrityarchaeologyHome
﻿
How can you mend a broken heart?” These lyrics were prophetically written by brothers Barry and Maurice Gibb with Maurice’s twin Robin joining in on the group’s vocals. Together they were known as The Bee Gees.
The year was 1971 and the song became their first number 1 on the US’s Billboard Hot 100. The Bee Gees would go on to become the only group in history to have written, recorded and produced six consecutive number one songs.
Tragically, the last remaining brother is lead singer Barry Gibb. Maurice died in 2003 at age 53 from a twisted intestine and his twin Robin died at age 62 in 2012 from cancer. Younger brother Andy, who was a solo artist with his own string of hits – died in 1988 from inflammation of the heart compounded by drug abuse. He was only five days past his 30th birthday and had recently come clean from an addiction to cocaine and Quaaludes.
Following his brothers’ deaths, Barry told the UK’s Daily Mirror in an interview that after a performance on Saturday Night Live, also starring Paul McCartney, he looked at his old friend Paul and said: “I’m not sure how much longer I can keep doing this. Paul said, ‘Well, what else are you going to do?’ And I just thought, ‘Well, OK, then’.”
Throughout their career, The Bee Gees had many comebacks. They also had split up for a time but according to Barry in a Daily Mail interview. How intense was the sibling rivalry in the Bee Gees? ‘Well, I don’t think it’s any different from any other family of brothers or sisters.’ A mix of competition and closeness? Yes. All of those things. You have enormous arguments. Then you become incredibly close and again have really angry moments with each other. Nothing different from any other family except our obsession with music. That’s how it was.”
The Gibb brothers were originally from the Isle of Man off the west coast of England. Their father was a band leader and their mother was a housewife. In their youth, the family moved to Australia. Barry dropped out of school at age 15 and the twins dropped out at age 13. They practiced their harmonies at home and Barry, known as the good-looking toothy Gibb, perfected his falsetto voice. They returned to England and had two hits “New York Mining Disaster 1941” and “To Love Somebody.”
They would experience 5 years in what Barry called “Pop Wilderness,” before they had another hit.
The group was almost written off until the soundtrack of “Saturday Night Fever” was released in December 1977.
They wrote the first five songs on side A, which forever defined the Disco era, in just one weekend. Their five original songs were: “Stayin Alive,” “Night Fever,” “How Deep Is Your Love,” “More Than a Woman and “If I Can’t Have You.”
The soundtrack has gone platinum 15 times and earned The Bee Gees a Grammy Award.
The BeeGees sold more than 200 million records worldwide.
In 1997 they were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Besides writing for themselves, they wrote and produced music for Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.
Barry has since taken to the stage as a solo artist reviving The Bee Gees’ mega hits, and in the process, has found a new generation of music fans.

PODCAST EPISODE 9 – Joe Namath
By celebrityarchaeologyHome
﻿
Joe Namath is a former American football quarterback and actor known as much for playing on the field as playing off the field.
The Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania native 1969 Super Bowl III star made headlines while escorting arm candy such as Mamie Van Doren, Randi Oakes and Raquel Welch. He even dated Janis Joplin. But it was in 1984 that Joe’s bachelor days were over when, at age 41, he married 22 year old Deborah Mays. He said at the time: “She caught my last pass.” The marriage lasted almost 15 years and produced two daughters, Grace and Olivia.
Mays , who said she was “bored” with Joe, took off with a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and left Namath with the two girls in Florida.
Namath began his football career at the University of Alabama from 1962-1964. Paul “Bear” Bryant said he was the most natural athlete he ever coached. He left Alabama early for a professional football career and didn’t earn his degree from the university until 2007 at age 64. Joe played professional football in both the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for over 13 years during the 1960s and 1970s. He was an AFL icon and played for the New York Jets for most of his professional football life. He finished his career with the Los Angeles Rams. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. In total, he played 143 games in the AFL and NFL. He made it to three division champions (the 1968 and 1969 AFL East Champion Jets and the 1977 NFC West Champion Rams), and earned one league championship (1968 AFL Championship).
His one Super Bowl victory was Super Bowl III in 1969. Chronic injuries from the game continue to haunt him. In 1992 ,he had knee replacement surgery on both knees. He also says that he has had long term health problems as a result of concussions while playing football. “None of the body was designed to play football,” he told the New York Daily News in 2014. “Excuse me, you know, football, we’re just not designed for.” Joe’s other career paths including nightclub ownership, sports commentator, film star and TV actor.
You can catch him in such films as C.C. and Company with Ann-Margret or reruns of The Love Boat, The A-Team and Married…with children. He also appeared in summer stock. At the height of his fame, he was seen in a TV commercial wearing Hanes pantyhose and one in which Farrah Fawcett gave him a close Noxema shave.
An embarrassing on-air moment came for a drunken Namath in 2003. He told sports interviewer Suzy Kolber: “I want to kiss you. I couldn’t care less about the team struggling.” He apologized and two weeks later entered an outpatient alcohol treatment program. In 2013, Namath’s daughter Olivia married her baby daddy at the Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Florida.
She was just 16 when she had Erwin Baker III’s daughter. Baker has a lengthy rap sheet including pleading guilty in 2006 to armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon at a McDonald’s near his home. Namath gave the bride away.

‘Ashamed I Will No Longer Be’ and Other Poetry by Firestone Feinberg
The Society
May 21, 2014
Beauty, Humor, Poetry
Ashamed I will no longer be…
Ashamed I will no longer be
To write an older poetry —
I have the right to reach for rhyme
And make the most of measured time —
While looked upon I am with scorn —
And ridiculed — as per fashion —
I recall many others torn
Away from their deep heart’s passion
By an ignorant and cruel crowd
Who spew the usual nonsense
Deriding us; as if license
To judge was just to them allowed.
Now suddenly my sight comes clear:
What motivates these men is fear!
Takes courage to defy the norm —
And courage takes a frightful form.
The boy of words who never had spoken…
The boy of words who never had spoken
Stood at the edge of a universe hurt
And silently wept for dreams become cursed
And daydreams and rainbows all but broken.
Yes. Even these he had barely known — when
Each one collapsed and each one deserted
What had already been a damaged world —
Where it seemed most everyone was no one.
His tears turned to ice — and then to diamonds —
A miracle wrought — and value declared —
Despite the sad stillness of the moment…
For beauty is beauty — never undone —
Nor be so true wonder — the child of care —
These — and love too — eternally present.
Undone remain the greatest deeds…
Undone remain the greatest deeds
That man has in his power —
Unplanted, too, the potent seeds
That yield the peaceful flower —
How long the time before the end?
How short the song we sing?
Until there be no more, my friend,
Of that we dare to dream.
A Poem Certainly Has a Nose
A poem certainly has a nose —
How else to smell a rose so sweet —
As well, it surely must have toes:
Necessity — for one with feet —
Firestone Feinberg is a poet living in New York City.

Vocal legend Aretha Franklin took to the stage at CitySquare's annual fall fundraiser, A Night To Remember, to help the organization raise a record $850,000 for its fight against poverty.
Guests — including Brenda and Larry James, Richard and Beverly Osteen, Tanya and Tarik Rodgers, and Wendy and Boyd Messman — packed the Winspear Opera House as co-chairs Cindy and Scott Collier and Kara and Ross Miller, along with honorary chairs Annette Simmons and daughter Amy, welcomed them to a candlelit dinner honoring major sponsors.
Then it was showtime, and the undisputed Queen of Soul performed for 90 minutes. A delicious dessert reception ended the night on an even sweeter note.
For more than 25 years, CitySquare has addressed the root causes of poverty by working together with the people they serve. Originally started as the Central Dallas Food Pantry, CitySquare has now grown to be one of the largest, most effective social services organizations in Texas.
Previous big-name performers for this highly anticipated event include B.B. King, Steve Martin, Clint Back, Patti LaBelle, Bill Cosby, Jay Leno, Lyle Lovett and Diana Ross.

Yemen: Ansarullah's No. 2 Man Alive
Tweet
TEHRAN (FNA)- Informed sources in Yemen rejected Saudi media reports about the death of Abu Ali al-Hakim, the military field commander of Ansarullah and the revolutionary group's deputy leader.
"The reports on the death of Abu Ali al-Hakim are rumors and he has not been hurt at all," a Yemeni source told FNA on Wednesday.
Al Arabiya news channel claimed on Friday that al-Hakim has been killed.
Hakim, who is considered to be second in command below Abdulmalik al-Houthi, was reportedly killed after sustaining injuries prior to the ceasefire which was announced on Tuesday, the Saudi-based channel had claimed.
Saudi Arabia launched its bombing campaign against Yemen on March 26 in an attempt to restore power to fugitive President Mansour Hadi, a staunch ally of Riyadh.
Hadi stepped down in January and refused to reconsider the decision despite calls by Ansarullah revolutionaries of the Houthi movement.
Despite Riyadh's claims that it is bombing the positions of the Ansarullah fighters, Saudi warplanes are flattening residential areas and civilian infrastructures.
According to FNA tallies, the Saudi attacks have so far claimed the lives of at least 3,824 civilians, mostly women and children.

The Shocking Republican Attack on the Environment and Our Drinking Water
Dec 14th, 2011 | By Environmental Headlines -- CT environmental news
WASHINGTON, DC (ENS) — This year, residents of Midland, Texas sued Dow Chemical for dangerous levels of hexavalent chromium in their drinking water.

‘Kremlin’s greatest worry: will the siloviki shoot at the people?’ and other neglected Russian stories
Putin seeks to recreate the Stalinist system of state security in Russia (Image: FSB press service)
2017/04/23 - 13:16 • International, More
The flood of news stories from a country as large, diverse and strange as the Russian Federation often appears to be is far too large for anyone to keep up with. But there needs to be a way to mark those which can’t be discussed in detail but which are too indicative of broader developments to ignore.
Consequently, Windows on Eurasia each week represents a selection of 13 of these other and typically neglected stories at the end of each week. This is the 79th such compilation, and it is again a double issue. Even then, it is only suggestive and far from complete, but perhaps one or more of these stories will prove of broader interest.
1. Support for Putin ‘a Ritual Not a Reality.’
Russian commentator Tatyana Stanovaya says that the high levels of support for Vladimir Putin should be viewed as a public ritual rather than a reality, and other experts say that Putin is going to have to choose between getting 70 percent support and 70 percent participation in the upcoming elections. He can’t get both as his aides say he wants.
Other Putin news this week:
He takes care of his friends and has changed traffic rules to benefit his biker buddies
Cossacks say that a good Cossack can’t oppose Putin and exclude one of their own who does
Farmers in Volgograd want to use Putin’s name as a magic wand – they are pressing to rename their market for the Kremlin leader in the expectation that local officials won’t close anything bearing his name
Meanwhile, in Western Ukraine, a fresco has appeared in a Lviv church showing Putin as many would like to see him, burning in hell at the last judgment.
2. Kremlin Seeks to Reign In Anti-Trump Tide.
Having promoted a groundswell in support of Donald Trump last year and then an equally powerful one against the new US president when he didn’t perform as Moscow expected, the Kremlin is now taking steps to reign in, at least a little, anti-Trump statements on Russian television. It sharply criticized one host for comparing Trump to the North Korean dictator.
The Kremlin may have been rattled by poll results showing that one Russian in seven thinks that Russia is now at war with the US and by concerns that anti-Trump rhetoric will preclude some kind of a deal. According to one commentator, if Moscow plays its cards right, Trump will agree to having Russia serve as a regional hegemon, backing Moscow “as a local sheriff dealing with Indians.”
Whether a more moderate approach to Trump will work is unclear, especially in the wake of new Western reports about Moscow’s meddling in the US elections last year, something the US administration can effectively counter only by adopting a hard line on Russia.
3. IMF Says Russian Economy ‘Condemned to Falling Ever Further Behind’ West
With Russian commentators pointing out Kremlin claims about improvements in the country’s economy fall within the margin of error, the International Monetary Fund has released a study showing that Russia is “condemned to falling ever further behind” the economies of the rest of the world.
There was certainly plenty of evidence this week for such unfortunate conclusions:
Bank deposits are at their lowest point ever
The country’s reserve fund is at the lowest point since its founding
Government employees’ incomes are growing twice as fast as those of the population
70 percent of Russian families are said to be at the edge of survival
40 percent of Russians are now part of the black or gray market economy as firms seek to avoid taxes (profi-forex.org, rbc.ru, profile.ru and ng.ru)
The Russian government has again reduced the minimum standard of living figures in order to avoid having to report growing poverty
Economists say that sanctions have reduced the Russian standard of living by 10 percent
Ever more Russians are taking out new loans to cover old ones they can’t pay
Russian consumer demand is now too low to support growth
There was only one “bright” spot in the Russian economy this week: analysts reported that the Russian pornography industry continues to grow at double-digit rates.
4. Russian Adults Now Consuming 30 Liters of Pure Alcohol Every Year
Although Moscow claims that Russians are drinking less, experts say that in reality, Russians are drinking far more alcohol, as much as 30 liters a year, if one includes not only samogon [illicitly distilled Russian vodka (home brew) — Ed.] but increasingly dangerous surrogates, thus exacerbating what is already the most serious national alcohol problem in the world (kasparov.ru, republic.ru and siberiantimes.com).
Other social problems reported this week:
A hospital in the Altay has appealed to the population to bring it potatoes so patients won’t starve
A Russian State Duma deputy has called for ending subsidies to single mothers lest the authorities encourage such an alternative life style
Schools in some parts of Russia are feeding rich children better than poor ones
Many university instructors and researchers are now losing their jobs
Some Russians are complaining that Moscow falsifies news even when there is no reason for it to do so
The Aeroflot stewardess who sued the airline for her dismissal because she didn’t meet appearance standards has lost her case
The sharp deterioration of Russians’ diets means that Russia now ranks third in the world in terms of the share of overweight people
Government officials may be able to continue to work until 70 under a new bill thus protecting their incomes and perhaps maintaining their loyalty
The government is preparing a new law to ban all VPN services and browser anonymizers in its effort to restrict Internet access
And as things deteriorate, the KPRF has urged that the government assume all costs for burials to ensure that at the end of their lives, Russians won’t be further embarrassed by their poverty.
5. Discrimination Against Non-Russians Begins at the Russian Border
Non-Russians say they are subject to discriminatory behavior by Russian officials from the moment they arrive at an airport in that country and that the discrimination continues as they move throughout Russian society (caucasustimes.com and moslenta.ru).
Other news this week from the nationalities front:
A Russian commentator says Moscow destroyed the Tatar banking system to show Kazan’s weakness in advance of talks about extending the power-sharing agreement
Moscow is whipping up the Bashkirs against the Tatars as part of this effort (nazaccent.ru and regnum.ru)
A Tatar writer says that she cannot earn enough money writing in Tatar alone
North Caucasian officials are being condemned for past support of the idea of national self-determination for the Circassians
There are no so many Muslims in Russian prisons that special courses for jailers have been organized to teach them how to interact with Islamists.
6. Protests Will Grow Because Russians Lack Other Ways to Make Demands – and Demos Sometimes Work
Russian experts say that the number of Russians taking part in demonstrations will increase because they have no other way to advance their causes and because in some cases, as in Novosibirsk this week, protests actually work with officials changing policies as a result.
That may help explain why Vladimir Putin ordered his subordinates to devote more attention to citizen complaints and why his regime is searching for a new youth movement to divert young people from anti-regime protests.
Other news this week from the protest front, besides the truckers strike, includes:
Moscow’s apparent decision to mark the Year of Ecology with expanded arrests and harassment of environmental activists
New data showing far more people were detained on March 26 than had been initially reported
The detention of a Dozhd television host for appearing at a demonstration dressed as a penis.
7. Russians Favor Burying Lenin But Maybe Not Just Yet
Some 60 percent of Russians now favor burying Lenin, but that figure, widely cited in the West, may be deceptive: Only half of those want that to happen now; the other half want to wait until the older generation has died off.
Polls show that Russians have an increasingly positive attitude toward Lenin and that nearly four out of five oppose taking down statues of the founder of the Soviet state.
Reflecting this situation, United Russia deputies first supported and then backed away from a Duma measure to call for Lenin’s reburial now, as debate continued over whether there has been enough de-communization in Russia or not.
Meanwhile, on other parts of the monuments war front:
The Russian Orthodox Church was caught destroying a church it had been given back in the name of “restoring” it
A shopping center opened in the controversial Yeltsin Center
Activists in Orenburg are promoting the idea of a statue to Russian MIA’s
And the fight over St. Isaac’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg continues in the courts.
8. More Problems with the 2018 FIFA World Cup
Moscow has launched a nice offensive to try to win support for its holding the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with Russian athletes now apologizing for their use of drugs in the past, but that effort has been undercut by the announcement of other Russian officials that they have come up with an alternative to one of the banned drugs, continued problems with venues, and the unwillingness of international companies to sponsor advertising for the games.
That has led to a petition campaign to strip Moscow of the World Cup and calls by a US senator to shift the competition to other countries, calls that FIFA has so far rejected because it says it doesn’t want to politicize sports.
9. Kremlin’s Greatest Worry: Will the Siloviki Shoot at the People?
A Moscow commentator says that anger among the population against some government policies is now so strong that it is infecting members of the siloviki who after all are Russians as well, thus raising the question: will such people follow orders to shoot at protesters or will they go over to the side of the people.
One reason for their possible reluctance to shoot is that the population is increasingly armed and even prepared to attack government offices as happened at the FSB headquarters in Khabarovsk this week. Many of the weapons now in private hands are flowing in from the Russian-occupied Donbas.
10. A Third of Russians Oppose Moscow’s Military Operation in Syria
According to a new poll, a third of Russians oppose Moscow’s military operation in Syria, a number that may rise when Russians learn of official efforts to under-report combat losses and of problems in military units their government has dispatched there.
But Moscow has other security problems as well:
Its missile factories are almost at a standstill because of shortages of parts and problems with existing systems
And some of its intelligence operations are collapsing and being exposed as those initially recruited to work for Russia decide to turn the tables
In the face of these problems, Vladimir Putin focused on what must seem a major one to him: he met with the defense minister to discuss ensuring an adequate supply of kvass to Russian soldiers.
11. China Passes Russia in Space Race
Russian commentators say that because of problems in Moscow’s space program, China now ranks ahead of Russia in that competition.
12. Russian Road Repair Truck Swallowed by Pothole
Russia’s roads remain notoriously bad. Emblematic of that is a new report that a road repair truck called to fix a pothole arrived only to fall into it and have to be pulled out by another.
13. California Secessionist Asks for Permanent Residence Status in Russia
A man who presented himself as the leader of #CalExit, a plan for the state of California to secede from the United States has now asked for permanent residence status in Russia, the country where he has long been living.
14. Poking Fun at Reporting Requirements, Petersburg Legislator Says He has Land on Mars
A member of the Leningrad oblast legislature, apparently upset by requirements that he report his holdings, has declared that he owns land on Marx and also on several stars beyond the solar system.
15. Destruction of Geology in Russia Means More Buildings May Fall Down
A scholar says that Moscow’s cutbacks in support for geological science means that fewer investigations will be conducted to determine whether the soil in particular places can support the buildings businessmen and the government want to erect. As a result, many buildings are likely to go up where they shouldn’t and then collapse.
16. Russia to Be Hit Harder by Global Warming than Anyone Predicted But Climate Change Denial Spreads
A group of American scholars has concluded that every degree of global warming will wipe out a much larger area of permafrost than anyone suspected (New York Times, April 13, 2017, p. A7). Russia, the country with the largest permafrost area, will thus be hit harder and more quickly than anyone predicted. Nonetheless and for the same reasons as in the West, climate change denial is spreading in Russia with ever more people advocating that Moscow end climate cooperation with the international community.
17. Moscow Wants to Seize Property from Anyone Charged with Almost Any Crime
The Russian authorities have long confiscated the property of those they have convicted of serious crimes, but now the Russian justice ministry is proposing to seize the property of almost anyone charged with almost any crime.
18. Zhirinovsky Says Release of Data on Deputies’ Wealth Could Unsettle Society
Russians might react with anger to information about the holdings of Duma deputies, LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky says; and so it would be better for all concerned if such information remained beyond the public eye.
19. Russian Support for Stalin Triples Since 1991
The share of Russians who say they have a positive attitude about the Soviet dictator has tripled since the end of Soviet times.
20. Magadan Editor Who Denounced Russian Diplomats as Soccer Louts Fired
The editor of a Magadan newspaper who expressed outrage at the statements of Moscow’s acting permanent representative to the UN and suggested that Russian diplomats should give up their suits and dress as soccer fans has been fired.
21. Even Unequal Animals are Unequal
According to government declaration forms, Duma deputies are significantly more wealthy than Kremlin officials.
22. How Bad are Things in Russia? Some from There are Now Working in North Korea
The economic situation in Russia is now so dire that some Russians have elected to move to North Korea to earn their keep.
23. The Trust Lives!
A new history of Feliks Dzerzhinsky’s notorious false flag operation against the Russian emigration and Western intelligence services has been released to rave reviews in Moscow.
24. Russia Becoming ’15 Cities Surrounded by Emptiness and Linked by Bad Roads.’
The emptying out of the Russian countryside means that that enormous country is increasingly being reduced to “15 cities surrounded by emptiness and linked together by bad roads,” according to Moscow commentator Yekaterina Schulmann.
25. A Country Called Russia May Not Exist in 2100, Scholar Says
Andrey Movchan says that if current trends continue, a country named Russia may not survive until the end of the 20th century.
26. If USSR were Restored, Only 46 Percent of Its Population would be Russian
A new Western study has pointed out that there are compelling reasons why Russians should not want to see the restoration of the Soviet Union. Were that entity to be re-established as some in Moscow want, only 46 percent of its population would be ethnic Russian and only 58 percent would speak Russian, figures that would guarantee that the processes of disintegration would simply be reignited.
And 12 more from countries in Russia’s neighborhood:
1. Fourteen of 96 Terrorists Killed by US MOAB Bomb Strike in Afghanistan were Tajiks
Officials confirm that 14 of the 96 terrorists killed by the US-use of the “mother of all bombs” in Afghanistan were from Tajikistan, yet another indication of the increasing participation of Central Asians in Islamist forces abroad.
2. Soldiers Face Hard Times in Central Asian Armies
A survey of military life in the five armies of Central Asia finds that soldiers in these forces face more than the usual problems of life in uniform with food shortages, brutality and delays in receiving pay common.
3. Moscow Goes to Extreme Lengths to Discredit Balts
In its annual report, Estonia’s security service documents that Moscow security services dispatched a swastika-tattooed Russian skinhead from St. Petersburg to Estonia so that he could be photographed by the Russian media to support Moscow’s claims of a revival of fascism in that Baltic country.
4. ‘Baltic Elves Battle Russian Trolls’ on the Internet
On the front line of Russian cyber-aggression, the Baltic countries have stepped up their defenses against it. Those who fight Russian trolls are now known in Russia at least as “the Baltic Elves.”
5. Latvians Feel Less Secure than Estonians or Lithuanians
Polls show that Latvians continue to feel less secure than their Baltic neighbors to the north and south, the result of Moscow’s greater efforts there and the sense that their large ethnic Russian community makes them more vulnerable to such influence attempts.
6. An Ethnic Russian in Estonia Says He Feels Neither Russian nor Estonian
A man who was born an ethnic Russian but who has learned to speak Estonian and to accept many Estonian values says that he feels trapped between being the ethnicity of his birth and the ethnicity he is rapidly acquiring.
7. 20 Percent of Ukrainians Went to Easter Services: Only Four Percent of Russians Did
Despite much talk in Russia about religion being one of the core national values, only one Russian in 25 attended Easter services this year. In Ukraine, in contrast, one in every five resident did so.
8. Armenian-Georgian Agreement on Transportation Corridor Helps Iran, Hurts Russia
Moscow officials are alarmed that an agreement that will allow Armenian goods to flow through Georgia will hurt Russia by undermining its influence in Yerevan and help Iran by giving it another path to send goods to the West.
9. Is Black Going to Become the New Orange in Kazakhstan?
President Nursultan Nazarbayev wants to prohibit women from wearing black except at times of mourning in order to limit the influence of Islamist groups in that country. He also wants to ban beards beyond a certain length.
10. Belarusians Say They Now have a LULAG, not a GULAG
Belarusian opposition figures are now referring to Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s prisons and camps as the LULAG “in honor” of their president.
11. Moscow Promoting a New Kind of Ethnic Change in Occupied Crimea
Because Vladimir Putin has opened the way for more Crimean Tatars to return to Russian-occupied Crimea, Moscow is engaged in another form of ethnic displacement there, a policy in direct violation of international law. According to Russian media, Central Asians are taking advantage of this new Moscow policy to move from their homelands to occupied Crimea.
12. Outmigration from Ukraine hasn’t Increased But It has Shifted Away from Russia to Europe
Ukrainians continue to move to other countries in search of work, but the total number remains largely unchanged despite Russian media suggestions to the contrary. What has changed is that Ukrainians are not moving to Russia as they once did but rather to EU countries.

Changes in AIDS Epidemic Will Impacy Policy
Advocates Focusing on Changing Epidemic and the 1999 AIDS Budget
May 27, 1998
(WASHINGTON, DC) – As AIDS advocates and public officials study the dramatic changes in the AIDS epidemic, members of Congress are weighing the impact such changes will have on public policy and funding priorities.
At a Capitol Hill policy briefing for Congressional staff held on May 14, leading AIDS advocates, local and state activists and health officials, and top AIDS researchers reviewed the changing epidemic, particularly the shifts in affected populations and the impact of breakthrough AIDS drugs, which have slashed the AIDS death rate nearly in half nationwide. The briefing was sponsored by the Log Cabin Education Fund AIDS Policy Institute, a non-partisan organization, and was co-chaired by Congressman John Porter (R-IL), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS and Education, and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D-CA) of the House Commerce Committee.
Dr. Oren Cohen, Deputy Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, comprehensively reviewed the state of HIV/AIDS research, and tracked the epidemiology of HIV. Cohen stressed that new breathrough comibination drug therapies have brought the AIDS death rate down dramatically, "but without access to these treatments, they are no good."
Several of the participants in the briefing focused on the success of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), funded through Title II of the Ryan White CARE Act and administered by state AIDS directors. ADAP is a non-bureaucratic program which provides access to HIV/AIDS drugs to patients who are underinsured and do not qualify for Medicaid.
"The ADAP program is crucial for people with AIDS," said Dr. Michael Maurer of the Philadelphia Ryan White HIV Planning Council, who is under treatment with new AIDS drugs. "We hear a lot about the drugs available in combination therapy, but as you can see from my story there are many issues connected to their use and availability." Maurer detailed his 29 different medical prescriptions, and how access to each drug is inhibited by cost and lack of coverage outside ADAP and Ryan White funding.
Dr. Gus Birkhead, Director of the New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute, spoke on the success of the New York ADAP, which has become the model for other states around the country. Birkhead cited increased federal funding for Title II Ryan White ADAP, in partnership with increased state appropriations, as the means by which the New York ADAP expanded its formulary of AIDS drugs and dramatically increased access for people with HIV/AIDS.
Others stressed that the success in combating AIDS thus far is due to the primary research in the public sector, combined with the successful research and development in the private sector. Sam Kazman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute warned that overregulation of drug development and price controls on new drugs would cost lives, and past abuses by the Food and Drug Adminstration, such as excessive delays in drug approval, have already cost lives.
"More than any other public health issue, AIDS has highlighted the grotesque consequences of FDA policy," Kazman said.
Presenters also focused on shifts in the AIDS population. Martin Ornelas-Quintero, executive director of LLEGO, stressed that "out of a sampling of 25 states used the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the largest percent increase of HIV/AIDS cases was in the Latino/a community." Todd Summers, Deputy Director of the White Office of National AIDS Policy said that while gay men still make up the bulk of AIDS cases in the United States, AIDS has become the leading cause of death for young, African American women.
AIDS advocates have been meeting with Members of Congress over several weeks as the Fiscal Year 1999 budget has been advancing in the House and Senate. Log Cabin Republicans met with Congressman Bob Livingston (R-LA), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the office of Congressman John Kasich (R-OH), chairman of the House Budget Committee and discussed the importance of prioritizing ADAP and saving lives of people with AIDS in the federal budget. The leadership meetings are the centerpiece of an ongoing lobbying effort by Log Cabin Republicans to ensure that Congress continue its strong support of AIDS funding, and took place one day after the House Budget Committee circulated an initial draft of its budget resolution.
Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's largest gay Republican organization, with 50+ chapters nationwide, a full-time lobbying staff in Washington and a federal political action committee. Ensuring necessary funding for AIDS programs is a top Log Cabin Republicans legislative priority.

Ministry of Climate Change and Environment Holds Training Workshop for Specialists from Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance
Share
Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 14 May 2018: The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) organized a training workshop for specialists from the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, to familiarize them with the UAE's guidelines and legislation on the production and transportation of food products of animal origin and on ways to comply with them.
The workshop is in line with the Ministry's strategic plan to promote food safety in the country and its mandate to protect consumers from harmful, contaminated, adulterated food products that do not conform to safety guidelines.
Majd Alherbawi, Director of Food Safety Department at MOCCAE, affirmed that the Ministry is keen to organize initiatives that enhance awareness of the UAE's guidelines and legislation regarding imported food as outlined in the National Agenda for UAE Vision 2021, and to implement a health system based on the highest international standards, to promote a healthy society and environment in the country.
She noted that these activities also aim to provide consumers with maximum confidence and assurance regarding the safety of food products in the UAE.
They also seek to strengthen the country's position in the global food trading industry.
'The workshop aimed to raise the awareness of the specialists and train them on legislation, laws and mechanisms to enhance food security and rapid response to any emergency in the UAE and the region, to better manage and organize information related to food and to control incidents detected at any stage of the food chain through effective and comprehensive responses.
We also aim to provide a rapid mechanism for the exchange of information during food-related incidents among relevant stakeholders and concerned authorities in the UAE, thereby ensuring timely action is taken.
Through such efforts, when a food-related incident is detected, both inside and outside the country, we can establish effective links with relevant local, federal, gulf, regional and international networks to achieve favorable outcomes.'
Alherbawi pointed out that the workshop highlighted MOCCAE's organizational structure, the federal laws and legislation related to food safety, the requirements for accreditation of slaughterhouses outside the UAE and acquiring such accreditation online, and control procedures for imported food through Abu Dhabi and Dubai entry ports.
A visit to Jebel Ali Port and the Flower Center at Dubai Airports was organized to educate the trainees on the mechanisms of applying control procedures on imported food through the country's ports.
The workshop was also attended by representatives from the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority (ADFCA) and Dubai Municipality, who highlighted control procedures in each emirate to better organize food products in line with the MOCCAE's legislative procedures.

Open Road Tolling For New York By the End of 2017
All around the New York City area and slightly north, toll booths are being removed and replaced with electronic cashless tolling. This means that anyone entering or leaving New York City in their own vehicle will need to have an E-ZPass in their vehicle to pass through these “tolls.” Passing through these tolls without an E-ZPass will create a fine to be paid for your vehicle. These will not be small fines and will be strictly enforced once all of the cashless tolling is fully installed.
This step up in modernization will greatly help the flow of traffic, the burning of fuel and commuter travel time. Governor Cuomo hopes to have this in place by the end of 2017.
This is also the beginning of a major plan to rebuild and renovate New York’s airports, roads, bridges and an expansion of the Javits Convention Center. So watch out world…New York is getting a make-over!

Peruta v. San Diego
From iGeek
Jump to:	navigation, search
California was one of only 10 "May-issue" Conceal and Carry permits states (as opposed to "Shall-Issue"). Which means they can choose to use the "good cause" to set impossible standards that no one other than the politically connected or big police donors, to meet the standards -- thus they violate the intent of the law that is supposed to allow C&C permits (not deny them). Stacked on top of California not having open carry, it means that you have a right to have a gun, you just can't ever take it anywhere in California. And it's been ruled before that such restrictions violate the people's Second Amendment rights. The State's then A.G. (Kamala Harris) doesn't care about victims lives as much as her political career: and she had armed security guards, so that's all that mattered.

Conceal and Carry in California
All 50 states allow Conceal and Carry permits for guns(1). Illinois was the last hold-out, with a long-standing ban on concealed weapons -- but their ban was overturned in a federal appeals court, on Constitutional grounds, and finally had to capitulate to the Constitution in 2013. After decades of having some of the most violence and highest murder rate cities in the nation (Chicago), that anti-gun folks predicted that allowing citizens to defend themselves (and carry weapons) would result in a blood bath -- the results were predictable based on behaviors in other states: within 6 months their murder rate hit a 56 year low, burglaries, auto theft and robberies are down by 20%, 26%, and 20% respectively (2). Without a single tactic change they can point to, the Chicago Police tried to take credit for the sudden results. But this is the exact same effect seen in other places like 2008 in Washington D.C. (3) when they too were forced by the Supreme Court to respect citizens rights to guns (in D.C. v. Heller) -- they predicted a bloodbath, but saw a drop in murder rates 2 1/2 times the national average. The media ignored the story.
There are 3 categories of permitting:
Unrestricted (Constitutional Carry) - permit not required, anyone can carry
Shall Issue - there's no discretion in issuance, you meet the guidelines, you get the license
May Issue - at the discretion of state or local officials whether you're able to exercise your 2nd amendment rights
California was one of only 10 "May-issue" states, and was widely known to be assholes about it (one of the least compliant with the Constitution). Rural counties would respect the law and issue permits, but L.A. and Bay Area would use a "good cause" clause, to be impossibly high. Thus it was near impossible to get one (issuing only a handful a year), unless large donations to "Fraternal Orders of the Police" funds were paid, and even then, it was iffy. It was widely known this lead to deaths of some who were killed by stalkers and abusive partners while waiting for such permits, but the State's A.G. Kamala Harris didn't care about their lives as much as her political career: and she had armed security guards, so that's all that mattered.
So Peruta sued the state claiming that their restrictive standards was violating the 2nd Amendment. And the 9th Circuit ruled that San Diego County's restrictive policy resulted in the destruction of the typical law-abiding, responsible citizen's right to bear arms, thereby violating the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. (This fit with prior Supreme Court rulings). The results being that California would have to become a Shall-Issue state. (Which means the state needs to show just cause why someone shouldn't be allowed a gun permit, instead of where someone has to prove, compared to some arbitrary standard, that they need a gun permit in order to get one.
G2SAC Meeting
Around this time, I went to a G2SAC meeting (The Golden State Second Amendment Council), because one of the lawyers (Don Kilmer) that supported the case (and a couple of other pending ones), was going to be there and talk about the case and what it means.
I was worried it would be a few toothless militia men in a room, all talking about evil government, and/or some dry lawyer babbling on about some gibberish. Instead it was about 200 very civilized and educated people (packed large room), all with a cross section of jobs. (I sat with a couple of ex-Apple folks). And we listened to this lawyer explain the nuances of case law, and what it meant, and take questions (including mine) in a fascinating discussion.
Normally, the person impacted (San Diego Sherif) is the one that can appeal to a full 9th Circuit of 11 judges (en banc review of the ruling), if they feel they have a case of have been wronged. But they declined: recognizing the law, and accepting that any more stalling would be a waste of time.
But an hour or two before the meeting, Kamala Harris (California State Attorney General) had filed a petition to fight the ruling -- which is an appeal to let the State take over the case for the Sherif that no longer cares, and then take it to en banc itself. Out of respect for the State Office, the 9th circuit said that they'll agree to let her hijack the case, and hear the state's appeals to why the Constitution shouldn't apply to Californians.
From there, a couple things might happen:
The full panel could accept the 3 judge panels decision and done
The full panel could overturn the 3 judge panel (which is rare) and then it is appealed to the Supreme Court where it will probably win (if heard)
The full panel could overturn the 3 judge panel (which is rare) and the Supreme Court decided not to hear the appeal (or hears it and votes against the constitution)
All the odds are against Kamala winning, and she knows it. But she's just being an obstructionist. It took from 2014.02.21 until 2015.06.16 for the 9th Circuit to hear the case full en banc -- so Kamala "won" in that she got many more Californians denied of their constitutional rights for another year and a half. And at the end of 2015, a decision still hasn't come down. (Probably one or two sympathetic judges on the court, stalling this out for as long as they can). But Kamala is just stalling for as long as she can, even knowing she will eventually lose. But it's not her money, or civil rights she's stepping on. And she has armed security, so screw everyone else.
The lawyer explained that sometimes the process is the punishment. He's has taken dozens of cases where a home-owner did something legal and moral, but was punished for it. For example, a thug kicked in a guys door to do a home invasion, and the home-owner pulled a gun and fired it in the air, and the thug ran off. Then the thug or someone else, reported the gun shot to the police, and the D.A. then goes after the gun owner for brandishing or firing a gun within city limits, or firing it recklessly. (If the guy had shot the attacker, he'd have been justified. But by just trying to scare the intruder off, he proved that he didn't feel his life was in danger, thus the shooting was reckless).
It doesn't matter that the victim (the home/gun owner) was 100% in the right, and that the D.A. will ultimately lose. It isn't his money. The D.A. will make the home-owner defend himself in court, which usually costs him like $50-70K to get a lawyer, who has to do all the work to prepare for the case, depose people, and prepare. Then the day of the trial, after all the money is spend, the D.A. will say, "we'll take a plea bargain down to disturbing the peace" -- and the victim will take the deal (because it's not worth the risk of going to prison, for something he was 100% right on). The D.A. never gets a loss recorded, so "wins". And only the defendant loses. This is how justice rolls in California: fuck the little guy.
That's what Kamala is doing. She's wasting a ton of the court and state's time and money, in order to try to delay having to accept that the Constitution applies to her state.
It doesn't matter if she wins or loses ultimately, because it's not her money, and she gets to harass and delay the legal gun owners, from being able to exercise their constitutional right. So for her, that's a win. It's only the rest of us mere peons that lose. And people wonder why the most informed, trust out government officials the least. It's because they waste our money and time, on fights like this, and abusing their power and their oath of offices.

Addendum
What happened is they let Kamala Harris (now the foulest Senator in the land, since Harry Reid retired), was allowed to take a case (that she shouldn't have had standing over) to en banc 9th circus, where the full panel decided to overturn the 3 judge panel (which is rare). On January 12, 2017 it was appealed to the Supreme Court, where it will probably win (if heard), especially now thanks to 1 or 2 more Constitutional Judges installed on the Supreme Court.

Hypocrisy and Discrimination at MLK Commemoration
By Richard Larsen
Published – Idaho State Journal, 09/01/13
The dream that Martin Luther King, Jr. envisioned for America 50 years ago this week has mostly been achieved. But regrettably, those who attempted to honor him on the anniversary of his iconic “I Have A Dream” speech, rather than honoring him, tarnished his memory with a new kind of segregation and discrimination, based on ideology.
Dr. King declared, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” With a black president, and several black congressmen and civic leaders in attendance, clearly the racial glass ceiling is shattered. And while there may be still a few pockets of actual racism around the country, electoral evidence on its own clearly signals the demise of racial discrimination in any systemic form.
But what was in evidence this week in Washington was a new version of discrimination, based on ideology. Where were the only black U.S. Senator, and the only black Supreme Court Justice? They were unceremoniously not invited. It clearly is not based on race, but based on ideology. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is a Republican, and is the only black senator, and is one of only eight in history. Clarence Thomas is a conservative jurist, was appointed by a Republican president, and is only the second in history to hold that position. The only conceivable explanation for their exclusion is based on ideological alignment.
So let’s see if we understand this correctly. It’s not enough to be a minority and stand as evidence, based on station in life, that skin color no longer has relevance in today’s society. Rather, what’s most important is that one subscribes to liberalism, pay homage to their Party, and then skin color no longer matters. In other words, what the organizers of this week’s event honoring Rev. King did, was engage in exactly the kind of conduct King himself denounced. They discriminated.
In fact, of the three dozen speakers at the event, not one was a Republican, a conservative, or anything but a died-in-the-wool Democrat. Clearly we witnessed a gross and blatant example of discrimination. Why would they intentionally discriminate against the party of Lincoln, the party and ideology that pushed through the 13th and 14th Amendments ending slavery, and the party that pushed through the Civil Rights Acts of 1866, 1871, 1875, 1957, 1960, and 1964? None of those would’ve been possible without Republican support, and in most cases, ardently advocating for them.
It would appear that issues regarding race in the 21st century, are not about race at all, but about using race as a political tool for liberalism and advancing the cause of their party. How else could one possibly justify that the party of Strom Thurmond, Robert Byrd, and Jim Crow Laws, would be the arbiters of all arguments alleging racism? The hypocrisy and duplicity are unsurpassed! Especially when we realize that the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was himself a Republican.
Confirming this observation, King’s speech 50 years ago cited the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Amendments to the Constitution referring to our individual liberties as citizens. Yet the administration of the first black president, proving in part by his position that King’s dream has been realized, officially classifies the types of persons who quote those documents as terrorists, potential terrorists, or right-wing extremists. Based on that alone, Obama would’ve had to recognize in King a threat to national security. How’s that for an ideological conundrum?
It becomes painfully more clear all the time that the left’s concept of diversity, in a racial context, really has nothing to do with ethnicity, but everything to do with an ideological homogeneity, exclusivity and purity. The line of demarcation is purely ideological. If you’re a conservative or a Republican, expect no tolerance, no inclusion, no attempts at understanding, and no seat at the table of acceptable political speech. Such should be rather segregated from the mainstream of societal discourse, branded as possible terrorists, and classified as extremists.
Some of the idiocy that passed for lofty elocution at the rally this week confirms this observation further. Martin Luther King III claimed that some still use race as a “license to profile, to arrest and even to murder,” obviously referencing the Trayvon Martin case. Julian Bond, former chairman of the NAACP, claimed the Supreme Court had “eviscerated” the voting Rights Act by making it possible for states to pass voter ID laws. Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, apparently referencing the same Supreme Court decision, claimed that even though Klansmen in white sheets are no longer a menace, that judges in black robes pose as great a threat.
And then President Obama, in his inexorable role as salesman for his unpopular Obamacare, made a failed attempt at convincing us that MLK would’ve approved of it. Apparently the President has not read anything that MLK wrote or spoke of, since everything he said was based on the principle of freedom, which is sacrificed at the altar of the Affordable Care Act.
The Party that sponsored this week’s rally is ideologically and politically the least qualified to heap accolades on Rev. King. They have, after all, replaced their Jim Crow laws, forced segregation, and slavery, with government handouts and party loyalty that have made minorities slaves to new masters: the government, and the Party that controls it.

About the Author
More than anything, I want my readers to think. We're told what to think by the education establishment, which is then parroted by politicians from the left, and then reinforced by the mainstream media. Steeped in classical liberalism, my ideological roots are based in the Constitution and our founding documents. Armed with facts, data, and correct principles, today's conservatives can see through the liberal haze and bring clarity to any political discussion.

"The preservation of a free government requires, not merely that the	metes and bounds which separate each department of power be invariably maintained, but more especially that neither of them be suffered to overleap the great barrier which defends the rights of the people. The rulers who are guilty of such encroachment exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are TYRANTS. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor by an authority derived from them and are slaves….."

Four Questions For Brett Kavanaugh
A little Constitutional-fidelity test for Donald Trump's latest Supreme Court nominee.
So, Article III, Sec. 2 Cl. 3 Says...
ARTICLE III, SEC. 2, CL. 3 of the U.S. Constitution says: "The Trial of all Crimes, except in cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury..." This language is prescriptory, imposing a mandatory requirement on the government. No excepting language allowing for trial by plea bargain, or authorizing alternative means of adjudicating criminal guilt, is provided, and the inclusion of the one is the exclusion of all others.
Trial by jury is therefore not a "right" or "entitlement" which can be waived by a defendant. While the Sixth Amendment provides for some entitlements that can be so waived, such as a defendant's enjoyment of a "speedy" trial, the trial by jury itself is not made optional by the amendment.
Trial by jury is obligatory; it cannot be waived; and it is a Constitutional violation to pretend that the requirement can be evaded by simply refusing to apply the label "trial" to an alternative proceeding by which criminal responsibility is determined.
WE MADE JURY TRIAL OBLIGATORY to protect us from the sort of state under which the catalog of federal crimes is unconstrained in its growth by any practical considerations; the vast majority of accusations lead to "confessions"; and the People rarely exercise their hugely-important, Leviathan-restraining authority to determine the validity of government-made laws. In other words, we made jury trial obligatory to protect us from what we suffer now.
Those who wrote the Constitution implanted the jury trial requirement because they knew its power as a bulwark of liberty-- the preservation of which is the sole purpose of the state. Their intent is clear in the words of Art. III, Sec. 2, Cl. 3, and in their explanations for those words:
"It is not only his [the juror's] right, but his duty . . . to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, and conscience, though in direct opposition to the directions of the court."
-John Adams
"I consider trial by jury as the only anchor yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its Constitution."
-Thomas Jefferson
"The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy."
-John Jay
"The friends and adversaries of the plan of the [Constitutional] convention, if they agree on nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury; or if there is any difference between them it consists of this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty, the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government."
-Alexander Hamilton
"If it [jury power] is not law, it is better than law, it ought to be law, and will always be law wherever justice prevails."
-Ben Franklin
In light of the foregoing, it is clear that all federal criminal plea bargains are Constitutional violations.
What say YOU, Brett?

Then There's The Fourth Amendment...
LET'S TALK ABOUT SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. The Fourth Amendment says,
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
Does this mean that the People DON'T have a right to be secure against whatever some official subordinate to the Constitution-- which includes judges as well as members of the legislative and executive branches-- deems to be a "reasonable" search and seizure?
Well, first of all, let's remember that the Fourth Amendment came about as a rejection of the British practice of conducting searches and seizures-- under certain government-approved circumstances-- without particularization and sworn attestation of cause. These un-particularized and unsworn searches and seizures were deemed reasonable and necessary exceptions by British courts, and were conducted under what was known as a "general warrant".
Right off the bat, then, it is clear that the Framers did not intend the Fourth Amendment to allow "excepted" searches and seizures under certain circumstances, on the basis of a judicial view that such exceptions are not "unreasonable" (including under the pretense that everyone stepping out into public thereby waives one's "reasonable" privacy rights vis-a-vis the state). It is exactly against the pretense of such exceptions that the Fourth Amendment was imposed.
BUT WE DON'T NEED TO RELY on mere logic and common sense to get to the truth of the matter. Keeping in mind that in the eyes of the Founders and Framers the only way a search could ever be conducted was pursuant to a warrant-- and that deeming searches and seizures conducted under certain circumstances to be "exceptions" to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment is the functional exact equivalent of a "general warrant", lacking only that label-- let's look at what those who wrote and ratified the Fourth Amendment considered to be "unreasonable":
Here, as a first example, is the Fourth Amendment counterpart from the Declaration of Rights in the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776:
That the people have a right to hold themselves, their houses, papers, and possessions free from search and seizure, and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations first made, affording a sufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person or persons, his or their property, not particularly described, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.
Consolidated, this reads: "[T]he people have a right to be free from search and seizure [of any kind-- houses, papers and possessions, with no limiting specifications provided], and therefore warrants [again, the only mechanism recognized at the time by which any kind of search was permitted] ought not be granted without sworn allegations providing a sufficient foundation, and without particularity."
Similarly, the Virginia Declaration of Rights, another early version of the Fourth upon which the federal Constitutional amendment was modeled, reads in pertinent part:
That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offence is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted.
That is, "[S]earch[es]...without evidence [which is to say, testimony, which is to say, sworn]...are grievous and oppressive, and ought not be granted."
Both of these contemporaneous alternative versions of the Fourth Amendment plainly declare that searches and seizures without sworn allegations and particularity are unreasonable and prohibited. In fact, the Pennsylvania version expressly declares that any search and seizure unsupported by sworn allegations of cause and/or lacking particularity is contrary to the right Constitutionally asserted and secured therein.
James Madison, in arguing before Congress for the inclusion of the Bill of Rights (and, again, speaking in the context of ALL searches and seizures requiring a warrant), described his intent for the Fourth thusly:
The rights of the people to be secured in their persons; their houses, their papers, and their other property, from all unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated by warrants issued without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, or not particularly describing the places to be searched, or the persons or things to be seized.
Massachusetts, in its Constitution of 1780, put it this way:
Every subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws.
Plainly, the Framers adopted the Fourth Amendment to ensure that all searches conducted anywhere, at any time and under any circumstances other than arrest for conduct just committed are based on prior establishment of probable cause by sworn testimony, with particularity as to what is to be sought and seized. There IS no "reasonable search" exception that can be construed from the amendment.
The "unreasonable" in the Fourth's language doesn't distinguish one kind of search which needs a warrant from another kind that does not. Instead, it serves to label all non-conforming searches as thereby unreasonable and thus barred by the amendment.
But what do YOU think, Brett?
***
Here's Another Thing: The Constitution DOESN'T Say It's Authority Over State Actors Ends At The Water's Edge...
IT IS ONLY BY VIRTUE of the US Constitution that the federal government exists at all. That government-- and all its officials and agents acting in its name, or with financing and other resources provided under its auspices-- can lawfully do nothing except pursuant to a Constitutional allowance.
By the same token, everything done with government resources by government officials and agents, and everything done pursuant to alleged governmental authority, is subject to all the limitations, restraints, restrictions and requirements imposed by the Constitution. Those limitations, restraints, restrictions and requirements are nowhere made subject to any geographical limitations.
Whither go the power and authority of the United States, then, so go every Constitutional control and specification regarding the exercise of that power and authority.
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS is that setting up and operating places on foreign shores for the torture of prisoners-- or for doing anything with anyone in any way different from how things are done "by the book" in Poughkeepsie or Peoria-- is illegal. Likewise, kidnapping people off the streets of Milan or at the Canadian border or wherever, and handing them over to torturers (or just jailers) in other countries is illegal.
Picking out someone located in a foreign country who isn't even firing on Americans there, much less attacking America itself, and obliterating him with a drone-fired missile sans even any pretense of due process, is illegal. Even just supplying logistical and intelligence assistance to foreign governments in the knowledge it will be used by THEM to do such things is illegal.
For instance, a U.S. intelligence operative supplying satellite data which helps Saudis murder Yemenis is using American-bought and -owned resources in direct violation of the Fifth Amendment. The amendment prohibits the United States from depriving ANY PERSON (not just "any American") of life, liberty or property without due process of law. This prohibition obviously applies to doing these things by proxy or on behalf of others just as much as it does to the operative opening the bomb-bay doors directly.
And the pretense that any such illegal things are spared the proscriptions and prescriptions because Congress has issued an "Authorization for the Use of Military Force" (AUMF) holds no water. Even leaving aside the questionable legitimacy of an AUMF by which the Executive assumes the authority to choose those with whom the United States is at war (see below for more on that), crimes such as those described here are not events occurring in the heat of battle, where some concessions to the exigencies of immediate self-defense are inescapable.
These crimes are coldly calculated and coldly conducted by people in no personal danger whatever. They are committed against people who have never been shown by any fair and reliable process to have ever acted against any American or American interest.
Further, even if Congress could authorize the Executive to pick and choose those against whom he will make war using our stuff, Congress can't authorize him to ignore the Constitution while doing so (and the Judicial branch can't Constitutionally pretend otherwise, in light of the very straightforward terms of the Supremacy Clause).
I'd like to hear your thoughts about all of that, Brett.
***
Finally, For Now-- Let's Talk About Delegation
HERE'S ANOTHER THING THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T SAY: that Congress can delegate any of its law-making authority to anyone. In fact, the Constitution says the opposite, expressly vesting such authority exclusively in Congress. Because the Supreme Law makes that call (rather than just empowering Congress to do whatever it wants on all fronts), Congress cannot.
Further, because the Constitution makes that delegation call, and all acts of Congress must be in harmony with it, delegation of law-making authority cannot even be authorized by resort to the "necessary and proper" clause. That clause only provides Congress with law-making latitude in regard to powers vested in any branch of the United States by the Constitution itself, and again, re-delegation isn't among those powers.
SINCE ONLY CONGRESS HAS and can have law-making power (and law-making power means the authority to impose duties of commission and omission-- that is, what anyone must do, and what anyone must not do), it would seem to follow that the executive (and the courts, for that matter) CANNOT impose duties of commission and omission on anyone. That is, no mere regulation promulgated by some executive agency can command or proscribe the action of any American (or anyone else).
Because Congress cannot delegate what the People have delegated to it alone through the Constitution, any act of Congress which doesn't spell out its prescriptions and proscriptions can't have the blanks filled in by bureaucrats at some agency, however convenient such a thing might seem to the legislators or the bureaucrats. We, the People, have directed that our 535 personally-selected representatives are to do the work of filling in all those blanks.
If Congress taking care of its proper responsibilities means that there are an awful lot fewer blanks to fill, well, that's one of the biggest reasons we set things up this way. Our object, in establishing the state and doing so in the manner that we did, was not to initiate or authorize the minute supervision and control of everything any or all of us do. Rather, it was to ensure that we were unhindered in our exercise of liberty and pursuit of happiness in any way not so obviously necessary that it could be readily understood and articulated by any given collection of our representatives.
We were, in framing the Constitution, mindful of the wisdom of Marcus Tullius Ciceroca, who cogently observed: "More laws, less justice". We viewed things the way Thomas Jefferson did, who spoke for all of us in saying, "I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than those attending too small a degree of it."
In fact, it can be said as axiomatic that any legislative purpose which requires more effort to spell out in every detail than Congress itself is willing to spend is Constitutionally invalid, and even the impulse to embrace such purposes is deeply suspect. As Tacitus said, "The more corrupt the state, the more it legislates".
SO ALTHOUGH THE SUPREME COURT has shamefully allowed Congressional delegations of legislative authority over the years on one contorted rationale or another, in light of the foregoing the court having done so has been a corruption and all laws not complete in and of themselves as written and enacted by Congress should be deemed unconstitutionally vague. Or so it seems to me...

A Question For All Federal Candidates This Year
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure...
I SENT A CHALLENGE THE OTHER DAY to the only Republican candidate for the US House in my district who I would support in any event:
Kerry, I'm seeking agreement from all candidates for federal office on the foreign policy recommendations at losthorizons.com/A/WashingtonWisdom.htm. Can I count on yours?
-Pete
I LIKE KERRY. Among his many virtues, Kerry was very sympathetic to Doreen during her ordeal; is a regular DDay celebrant with us; and during his previous term in the House (2012-2014), Kerry outperformed the vast majority of the pack in terms of good votes and legislative initiatives-- a fact attested-to by the mainstream Republican establishment fielding a candidate against him (the odious Dave Trott) at its earliest opportunity.
If United States foreign policy weren't a key driver and rationale behind the growth and perpetuation of the massive and dangerous Leviathan state, my litmus test would be unnecessary and I would happily give Kerry my vote. I'd even help pound pavement for him.
BUT US FOREIGN POLICY IS the key driver and rationale behind the Leviathan state. Thus, I have to ask Kerry my question.
That policy, over the last 29 years, especially, has focused on destabilizing portions of the world (or has simply been so confused, incompetent or corruptly-directed as to have that as its invariable outcome, in any event). The chaos and strife that result are used as pretexts for funneling vast amounts of wealth from those who created it into the pockets of the those in the obscenely-swollen military-industrial-congressional complex.
Lunatic and pretense-based foreign policy, then-- invariably justified by resort to the needs of "allies" (who do nothing for us) or the threats of "enemies" (who do nothing to us)-- is the driving force and rationale behind the alleged need for huge tax revenues flowing to Washington. The perception of that need causes many Americans to reflexively support the "ignorance tax" scheme without giving it a moment's critical examination.
James Madison summarizes this dynamic in one grim paragraph:
“Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.”
Tom Paine says it in a single sentence:
“Taxes are not raised to carry on wars, wars are raised to carry on taxes.”
IT'S THIS SIMPLE: We can't have an aggressive, imperialistic foreign policy or presence and also have a limited, Constitution-abiding government at home.
We either have today's status quo-- a grossly-and-ever-more-expensive hobgoblin charade, or we have freedom and prosperity for ourselves and our kids.
I'd rather have freedom and prosperity.
My choice (if shared by a sufficiency of other voters) might mean that Raytheon and General Dynamics management and shareholders pocket less gold in the future. And it might mean that Britain, Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia must learn how to play well with others (as is lately being done by South Korea and Germany, to the telling condemnation of current US foreign policy beneficiaries).
But that's ok. I think these are small prices to pay in order to secure the heritage for which the Founders shed blood and which I want for my children.
How do you feel about this? And what does YOUR candidate say?

A Few Words About Declaration Day, 2018
It could just be one: "Wow!"-- but I'll say a bit more than that anyway...
FIRST OF ALL, I want to thank everyone who came this year and made the Eleventh Annual Declaration Day Party a truly wonderful event-- despite the record heat (we hit 97 that day-- a 108-year record for June 30 in Michigan). Doreen and I had a great time, and all of you are responsible for that.
I didn't have the camera out much this year, so I don't have much in the way of pictures to share, but I do have a few. One in particular gives me a chance to do a special shout-out to Dan and Jane Moore who, in addition to Dan's really outstanding smoked salmon (which he said he made using Alder wood something I now heartily recommend to anyone out there with a smoker), brought this devil's food beauty:
Delicious and delightful, and while the picture doesn't make it clear, this thing was enormous-- big enough to serve everyone in attendance with a piece! (And guys, next time we get down your way we'll bring that giant cooler you made to carry this in, and which you overlooked while packing up in the dark after the fireworks.)
ANOTHER NICE thematic touch was this little gem brought by Jerry and Kathy:
FINALLY, here are a couple of shots of this year's Curmudgeon's Croquet (won for the second year in a row by Dead-Eye George Papp):
(Yes, that's Barney among the otherwise uniformly humanoid pack of political and cultural parasites. Our Katie was at that age at that time. The hatred runs deep.)
ONCE AGAIN, a great time was had by everyone. The food was excellent; the company was better; Sarah's joyful surprise was priceless; and the fireworks on the lake were awesome, as always.
Thanks to you all.

Donald Trump Has Handed The CtC Community A HUGE Opportunity
However, urgent immediate action is required. Please don't let this gift slip away, people!!!
ON TUESDAY, JULY 3, Donald Trump leaked his "short list" of nominees to replace retiring justice Anthony Kennedy. On the list is Raymond Kethledge, who is distinguished from the rest of the pack by having revealed himself on paper as an oath-breaker and a clever, committed enemy of the Constitution. (On Monday, July 9, Trump named Brett Kavanaugh as his initial nominee, but see this discussion of how that is likely to play out, leaving what is said here unchanged.)
In March of 2016, Kethledge spat squarely on the First Amendment-secured right to freedom of speech and the Fifth Amendment-secured right to due process. Kethledge did this by affirming, with the most corrupt and contorted rationalizations, Doreen Hendrickson's engineered conviction on an unprecedented charge of criminal contempt of court for refusing to make court-ordered sworn declarations that she believes in the truth of government-dictated, government-serving, false testimony.

A Pair Of Old And Useful Windows On Current Events In The Middle East
Reaching into the past for information thwarts the agenda of present-day "fake news" mongers.
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE that one of the best ways to shield oneself from the effects of propaganda is to look to sources of information from before an issue became someone's cause, or before the spin war began, or became sophisticated, or became self-referential and self-sustaining. Early information is unspun and far more likely to be accurate.
In that vein, I would like to share two older documents regarding places and people in the Middle East, in the hope that they might help support clear thinking about the present-day situation insulated from what has long been a ferocious disinformation campaign attempting to gain control over the future by exercising control over what people are to believe true about the past. What value these docs may have will be up to each reader.

The Entire Legal And Practical Truth About The Income Tax In Three Short Sentences
Focus on these simple points and you can teach anyone the truth about the tax.
1. The income tax is an excise.
2. Excise taxes are taxes on the gainful exercise of privileges.
3. You probably didn't earn your money by exercising any taxable privilege (or earned very little that way).
Inarguable (and nowhere disputed) proof of the first two statements above can be found concisely spelled-out in this little 7-page document. Whether the third is true for any particular person can be determined by consulting this guide to understanding "income-taxable privilege".

"Tax Honesty" BS Is What Had Doreen In Prison
...just as much as does official corruption.
IN MID-SPRING I wrote about "Judge Anna" And Bat-Sh*t Crazy "Birth Certificate" Drivel. In a subsequent newsletter I had need to post an article about a seemingly viral infection of the community based on nonsense about HR1, more distribution of which continues despite my debunk.
Over the years I have posted dozens of debunks of dozens of similar packages of nonsense, as can be seen here. These debunks are thorough and dispositive. Continued promotion of any of them can only be seen as the deliberate sowing of disinformation and discord.
These endless injections of distracting and misleading gibberish (whether obvious gibberish or subtler gibberish that actually gives a surface impression of harmonizing with, or even supplementing the truth about the tax) serve-- either deliberately or mindlessly-- to keep the community out of focus and disunited in purpose. Thus, this community is rendered a blunt instrument at best, where a razor-sharp stake for the vampire's breast is needed.
Thus, the weight brought to bear on that stake, whatever the condition of its point, is light when it ought to be-- and needs to be-- crushingly heavy.

Now, THIS Is What I'm NOT Talking About!!
A simple way for everyone to get a lot done, fast, that no one is doing.
SO, MONTHS AGO I posted the following on this page (and it has remained here ever since):
IF EVERY STATE GROUP (or anyone else) were to devote some time and effort to scheduling and hosting presentations of this video to CPA and legal firms, a whole lot of good could be done in a very short order.
The requirements are simple. Book an hour with the chosen firm, with the understanding that all professional staff will be assembled for the presentation. A thoughtful introduction should make this inexpensive and easy.
Explain that all you are asking for is an opportunity to show a video in which some facts about the income tax are revealed on the basis of which tens of thousands of Americans have recovered $billions from the IRS and three dozen state tax agencies over the course of more than 14 years now, by way of a quarter of a million claims made with the tax agencies, and even in the face of agency resistance of several different kinds.

CAN YOU EVEN IMAGINE how abysmally stupid someone would have to be to continue to doubt or deny that CtC has revealed the actual, complete and insurmountable truth about the income tax in light of the overwhelming mountain of historical, legal, practical and logical evidence to the contrary? (Not to mention the outright lies and even ludicrous hoaxes the executive and some corrupt members of the judiciary have been caught at in desperate efforts to conceal the truth...)
Plainly any such denier must either be abysmally stupid or be an abysmally corrupt government official or other person who sees him or herself as benefitting from the lies about the tax by which America has suffered for 75 years now. Isn't this true?

Trolls Against The Truth: A Dis-Information Campaign
UNLESS YOU'VE LOOKED, you can have no idea of the volume, intensity and mendacity deployed in the government's efforts to discourage Americans from learning what is revealed in CtC. It's truly astonishing.
A lot of folks are aware of the show-trial events in which my wife and I have received state-engineered public beatings meant to scare people away from the truth about the "ignorance tax" scam. But many are unaware of the overall campaign. This is a shame, really, because a focused propaganda effort like this one is a very powerful acknowledgement of the significance of CtC's revelations.
While the majority of Americans do not yet know how CtC protects them from the vampire state, the vampire itself certainly does. Dis-information campaigns like this one make that very clear.
FORMER CBS REPORTER SHERYL ATKISSON describes some aspects of this sort of dis-information campaign in the following video. Despite the annoying preliminary 15 seconds or so of advertising, her presentation is very much worth watching:
(H/T to Greg Belcher for finding and forwarding this great presentation.)
Losthorizons.com is one of those websites specifically-targeted by the corrupt interests at Wikipedia described by Atkisson. The behind-the-scenes folks at that site won't allow links on their pages to anything posted at losthorizons.com, nor even just text corrections of misinformation in their pages about the income tax.
That's the least of it. Click here for some specific discussion of the enormous scare campaign that's been actively spreading false information in hope of discouraging legitimate media attention, as well as men and women simply seeking the truth about the tax and liberty from the scourge of the "ignorance tax".
PLEASE GIVE SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT to the fact that YOU being secure in your own freedom rests on others learning the truth as well, and recognize that it falls to you to help overcome the dis-information campaign. Post and share your videos; share your victories; help silence the agents-provocateur and distraction-injectors whose nonsense is discussed and debunked here; and widely (and frankly, impatiently) share this page, this page and this page, challenging everyone in your address book to disconnect the phone and the TV for an afternoon and get educated.
Doing these things will be what makes it happen, Cap'n.

Why Aren't People Suing?
In Passing... Three cheers for Russia, which has stepped up to join Iran in aid of its long-time ally Syria against the noxious "Islamic State" nutcases that have sprung up like toadstools in the wake of the destabilization of the Middle East by the noxious neocon nutcases running Washington for the last 15 years.
More Educated Americans Testify, Showing Why The Deep State Fears CtC
"If the taxpayers of this country ever discovered that we operate on 98% bluff, the entire system will collapse."
-Reported remark by an internal revenue service officer to Sen. Henry E. Bellmon (R. Okla.) on April 15, 1971.
"The Tax Code represents the genius of legal fiction... The IRS has never really known why people pay the income tax... The IRS encourages voluntary compliance, through FEAR."
-Jack Warren Wade Jr., former IRS officer in charge of the IRS Nationwide Revenue Officer Training Program, in his book ‘When You Owe The IRS’
CtC-EDUCATED, AMERICAN HERITAGE-LOVING grown-up Don La Vigne shares his testimony here. Tom Romin shares his testimony here. Greg Sutton shares his here. Enjoy Robert Harvey's testimony here. Don's, Tom's and Greg's and Robert's words, like those of others that can be found here, are solid examples of why the Deep State fears CtC.
It's this simple: If you study CtC you will know the truth about the tax. Further, you will know that you know the truth, beyond any doubt.
ONLY CtC will give you that certainty, because CtC is exclusively and uniquely complete and correct, as can be seen by any of thousands of different acknowledgements of every possible kind, from this to this to this to this.
Most telling, in its own way, is the government robotically resorting for years now to the strawman of falsely ascribing to CtC the ridiculous arguments that "wages are not income" and that only federal, state and local government workers are subject to the tax. This false ascription is then used as the basis for claiming the book is "false and frivolous"-- a lame and transparent dodge begging the question of why the state won't acknowledge what the book REALLY says and then attempt to dispute THAT.
Once you know the truth revealed in CtC, acting in accordance with that truth WILL liberate you from being an ignorance tax serf. This, the deep state fears mightily.
LIKE HENRY BELLMON WAS TOLD, the "ignorance tax" scheme relies on bluff-- pretending that the truth is what the government suggests that it is (despite what the law and the courts and every other authority have actually been saying about it for 150 years). And like Jack Warren Wade, Jr. says, the scheme relies on fear-- doing everything possible to make people afraid to act on their scheme-shattering knowledge of the truth.
In short, the "ignorance tax" scheme can only survive if Americans can be bluffed into not seeking out the truth, and if those who learn that truth can be discouraged from acting on that truth.
But those who know the truth, and know they know the truth, cannot not act.
Acting on the truth is a moral imperative, as well as a legal imperative.
The undaunted actions of those who know the truth are "calls" against the bluff. Each "call" ratchets-up the spread of the truth exponentially and forces state acknowledgement of that truth, one way or another; and each such acknowledgment takes America one step closer to freedom from the 75-year state-unleashing, people-restraining "ignorance tax" scheme.
And THAT's why the deep state fears CtC.

A New Policy
I HAVE DONE MY BEST to lead this country to liberty from the mis-applied income tax. I have labored hard. I've shed a lot of sweat, a fair bit of blood and more than a few tears. But I seem to be pretty poor at that kind of work.
When I have asked all of you for what I firmly believe is a necessary resource to move the ball downfield and give all of us the best chance at justice and an end to the assault on the rule of law-- simple testimonial videos requiring nothing from any of you but the phone in your pocket and three minutes of speaking from the heart-- I have had only a handful of people answer my call.
I CAN'T KEEP GOING THIS WAY. I have to be able to turn my attention away from writing new persuasive or skepticism-addressing articles week after week, and toward research, analysis and educational presentations that will benefit everyone already in this community. I need time to do some suing, and to bring together the resources and talent toward that end.
As said, it is my firm belief that your testimonial videos are the resource that I need to make big things happen, and they are unquestionably the thing I need to allow me to turn my attention away from trying to get horses to drink at the waterhole to which I have led them. Your words, in your great numbers and all in your own different ways, will do that better than anything I write possibly could.
And yet, you are not providing them. This, despite my having been asking you for them for many years now.
Therefore, with enormous reluctance, I am making portions of this website restricted access only. People have been urging me to do this for years now, telling me I should impose a charge to access my work-product, so as to enable me to keep producing.
I have never been inclined to charge fees for access. I ask for donations, and will continue to do that, and if they do not come, then I will conclude that my work is of no value to anyone, and I will close shop.
But I now WILL charge a special something for access to some key portions of that work-- testimonial videos, as discussed, described and demonstrated here.
SELECTED PAGES CONSTITUTING primarily "legal resources" pages now require passwords for access, and to get a password, I need your video. Similarly, if an email comes my way asking for guidance or assistance, it had best have a video attached, if I don't already have yours posted.
I hate to play it this way, but I want to win.
I'll tell you a story from when I was coaching my kids in soccer. Both of my kids at a certain age in their careers had run into a wall common to all but the very exceptional. They had gotten to be pretty good, and they wanted to enjoy the benefits of their hard work. But the arrival of this interest coincided with a new self-consciousness which made them reluctant to risk failing and looking foolish. So, they were hanging back from seizing the main chance when it appeared, and driving for the goal.
My solution was to post on the wall of our dining room a couple of simple points about self-discipline, the chief of which is this: You can't score a goal if you don't take a shot.
That's how it is here, too. If you don't stand up, you are laying down, and you'll never score that goal.
Here is what my kids live by now, in their own version of that lesson. I hear it from them all the time as they excel (accompanied by the sound of a father's breast swelling with pride): Go hard, or go home.
You, too. Go hard, or go home. Send those videos.
Do I ask for a lot? I want your victories to post, your financial support, your efforts at spreading the word, and your beautiful faces and inspiring words, too. It IS a lot.
But I'll let Thomas Paine explain:
"Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheaply, we esteem too lightly. Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods; and it would be strange indeed, if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.”
Fear nothing but God.

What Makes YOU A Warrior For The Truth?
We each have our reasons, and our story. It's time, and it's needed, for you to share yours with the world.
"The day we see truth and do not speak is the day we begin to die."
-Martin Luther King, Jr.
What does it for you?
Is it simply because no moral and upstanding person has any choice when it comes to telling the truth over his or her signature, whether on tax forms or anywhere else?
Is it recognition of the critical importance of the rule of law, and the knowledge that if everybody leaves its caretaking to someone else, it will soon be lost to us completely?
Is it the money?
Maybe it's just simple respect for your own rights as a human being, who is not and cannot be not involuntarily subordinated to others?
Maybe it's just simple respect for your general civic responsibility to be the grown-up and enforce frugality and restraint on a big, powerful creature of our own devising which otherwise is like a badly-raised teenage boy given whiskey and car keys and let loose on the road to wreak havoc?
Or is it, perhaps, a more acute anxiety that if our bonfire of a state isn't damped, and quickly, it'll soon burn down the house around us all?
What IS it that firms up your jaw and stiffens your resolve?
It's time to take off the bushel and share your light!
I would like you to think about what it is that motivates you for a few moments (or all day, if you like), and then send me your thoughts. I want to put YOUR reasons to work inspiring folks who don't yet understand what this is all about.
In this day and age, the most effective way for you to share your thinking for the benefit of others is to video-record yourself talking about how you feel, and explaining what inspires and motivates YOU.
All you need is a webcam or cell-phone equipped with a camera. If you don't have, or know how to use, one of these, have a friend help.
If needed, write a little script for yourself. Better, though, to just speak extemporaneously, after spending a little time sorting out your thoughts and getting down into your heart. Perhaps make it a video of someone in your family, or a close friend, interviewing you.
Dress "business casual". Be well-groomed.
Keep yourself to no more than 2 or 3 minutes, and keep in mind that the purpose is not to educate, but to INSPIRE, ENCOURAGE and ENERGIZE. Your video will be one of many to be shared.
You needn't feel any obligation to be profound, and you shouldn't try to explain anything about the law, other than to say that you have read it and you know it's on your side. You just need to be sincere, and uplifting. Your object is to make your audience want to have what you have, and to be where you are in your heart.
Keep in mind that you're speaking to an audience that doesn't yet know ANYTHING about the subject, and whose first reaction is, "This must be illegal; this must be dangerous; this is too good to be true." You want to pull that audience right past such things, and straight to a focus on truth, morality, and our American heritage of liberty and the rule of law.
Remember: INSPIRE, ENCOURAGE, ENERGIZE.
Speak about rights. Speak about morality, and the obligation of a grown-up and responsible person to speak the truth and to enforce the Constitution. Speak about everyone's duty to give to God what is God's, always, and to Caesar only what is really Caesar's. Speak of your obligation to respect yourself, and to look out for the current and future well-being of your children and your fellow citizens. Speak of CtC, and what its information has done for your understanding and resolve. Show the book.
If you have had victories, describe them. Better still, show them, if possible.
Be clear about just what you accomplished: EVERYTHING back-- Social Security, Medicare and all; a "notice of deficiency" closing notice; an on-paper agreement or acknowledgment that your earnings weren't subject to the tax and everything withheld or paid-in was an "overpayment"; a transcript showing all $0s; or whatever happened.
When you speak of state victories, name the state. If you had to overcome balkiness from a tax agency before winning any victory, describe that, too!
If you're in a battle now, speak of your resolve to uphold the law, come what may. If you haven't yet begun to act, speak of your decision to do so, and your plans.
Remember, your purpose is to INSPIRE, ENCOURAGE and ENERGIZE.
If you're dealing with ongoing balkiness, describe that, too, if you wish-- but be sure to explain why you're not discouraged, and why you are not standing down, not slinking back into the barn, and not choosing to endorse the lies.
Mention what you do for a living, whether you're a doctor, homemaker, lawyer, trucker, IT guy or gal, or a retiree or student. Help people understand that the company of grown-up activist Americans they are being invited to join cuts across all demographics and all interests-- with the common denominator being respect for the law and love of the principles on which this great country was founded.
This is your chance to get a LOT accomplished.
We've all had frustrating occasions of trying to explain all this to a friend, neighbor, family member or co-worker, only to pile up against the wall of a mind not yet ready to listen and learn. Here is your chance to address a self-selected audience of folks who have themselves decided that it's time for them to begin paying attention, and have clicked on your testimonial for exactly that reason.
Further, think about this: You want judges, bureaucrats, CPAs, lawyers, the HR people where you work, your pastors, your neighbors and everyone else to acknowledge the truth about the tax openly and straightforwardly. How and why would these folks do this if YOU won't?
You want these folks to learn the truth. Why would they even recognize that there is a truth to be learned if you won't attest to having learned it yourself? You've got to stand up, face forward and chin up and tell these folks that you have studied and checked and verified and seen the evidence and seen the government evasions and you know that the tax is not the capitation that the beneficiary government wants everyone to think it is but a benign, but strictly limited thing, and that they need to study and learn that, too.
Again, if you have victories to show, that's nice, and powerful, too. But you don't have to have victories to display in order to declare your knowledge of what the law says. I've never flown around the world, but I've seen the evidence and considered the arguments, and I'm not hesitant to declare it a sphere...
Even those of you who haven't yet studied CtC have surely read this short document, and have verified everything in it for yourself. You should therefore be declaring its veracity and its message, loud and proud. Again, if you won't say it, how can you hope that others will ever even bother to look at the facts?
Be the change you want to see in the world, or there won't be any change.
So, please make and send those videos right away! You can share them with me via a cloud-based drive space like OneDrive.Live.com or GoogleDrive, or mail DVDs to me at 232 Oriole St., Commerce Twp., Michigan 48382, or even email to me if each file is no more than 20 megs (and you can break a video up if need be-- I can reassemble them). Render as .mpg or mp4, if possible; if not, send them how you have them and I'll make them work.
Remember, the restoration of institutional respect for individual rights and the rule of law depends on enough individuals insisting upon it. Do your part to let those starting to rub the sleep from their eyes know that there is a community already waiting for their fellowship with open arms and open hearts and shining spirits.
See how some of your fellow warriors for the truth have done their parts in videos sent over the years, many of which are posted here.

The Crime of the Misapplied Income Tax

Was Grandpa Really A Moron?
Critical Inquiries for a New American Century
Bob’s Bicycles
or
Getting Free Of The "Income" Tax Scheme Is As Easy As Falling Off A Bike
To get an idea of how today's "income" tax scheme works, try this little exercise:
Think of the federal government as a guy named Bob, who lives down the street from you in a town that is really big on bicycles. Bikes get used for commuting, deliveries, shopping, etc.. In fact, other than walking, bicycles are the exclusive form of transportation in your town.
Your neighbor Bob has a by-the-mile bicycle-renting business-- "Bob's Bicycles". Bob's Bicycles is far and away the biggest business in town.
Part of Bob’s success is because he does a lot of contract business. However, Bob doesn't just get paid by riders who have signed an agreement with him, or even just those using Bob's bikes. Bob gets something every time anybody in town does any riding at all, through an odd combination of circumstances that took many years to come together.
Here's how it happened...
Bob's Bicycles was launched long ago by the great grandfather of the present Bob (Bob IV). Great Grandpa Bob started out not only with a main location for his contract business-- he also had the bright idea of setting up spots around town where he parked some of his bikes for use by the more occasional rider, on an "honor system". Anyone could take and use one of these bikes, but they were expected to keep track of their mileage, and send Bob a "1040 Mileage Ridden/Rent Due Form" (and the appropriate rent), periodically. The initial design of the form was like this:
I, ______________, rode a Bob's Bicycle a total of _____ miles this year.
At Bob's rental rate of $.15 per mile, I owe Bob $______
I said that Great Grandpa Bob planned to deal with these occasional riders on the "honor system", and that's true. But he liked his money, too, and didn't want to miss anything that was due him. So, after setting up the "self-serve" locations, Great Grandpa Bob went around handing out "W-2, 1099 or K-1 Rider Reporting Forms" to every other business in town. The forms-- accompanied by notices that if Bob didn't get his rent from someone riding a bicycle in connection with any business, he would sue the company involved-- said:

You are NOT being alleged to have received “foreign income”.
You are NOT entangled in an invisible “adhesion contract”.
You are NOT being obligated by a law whose subject is never identified.
You are being targeted because REAL EVIDENCE exists that YOU PERSONALLY HAD “INCOME” to which the revenue laws apply-- even though that evidence is almost certainly incorrect, and CAN be corrected.

A Few Tips For Making Best Use Of This WebSite
USE THE SITE MAP!!!
USE THE SITE SEARCH!!!
When directed to a page by topic or link, read everything.
I know that this can mean the investment of a lot of time, attention and effort, but although some may imagine otherwise, I don't write as much as I do because I can't think of any other way to spend my time...
Furthermore, when you encounter a hyperlink within, or associated with, the text you are reading, follow it!
It is pretty common these days for web-based material to be littered with hyperlinks. Sometimes the purpose is to provide definitions or examples, in order to ensure that folks reading the original material aren't presented with a word or reference which they don't understand. Sometimes the links lead to illustrations pertinent to the original text.
It is common-- and perfectly understandable-- for folks who are confident that they are familiar with language or references within the main text they are reading to get in the habit of skipping over included links. I do it all the time, myself!
However, I very rarely include links for definitional or explanatory purposes; and when I DO make a link out of text in one page it is generally to another self-contained page, rather than merely illustrative material. These other pages contain material the clear understanding of which I deem highly important for the proper and complete understanding of the original page. (Links to CtC, the Victories pages, CtC Warriors and so on are obvious exceptions to this general rule. On the other hand, a link to the victory Highlights or 'Every Which Way But Loose' pages, which might seem like such exceptions, are not. The special selection of victories on those pages, and the filed docs and tax-agency correspondences included therewith, themselves constitute highly instructive material which merits careful attention. Thus care needs to be taken in all cases.)
Please make a habit of clicking on all provided links and at least looking briefly to ensure that the linked page is one with which you are completely familiar from another study session.
Finally, please keep in mind that, annoying though it may seem at first blush (but not, I trust, upon reflection), I constantly tweak material already posted. Obviously this doesn't mean that every page is in flux at all times, but it does mean that if you are directed to a page that IS familiar, it's worthwhile to read it through again if it's been a while since your last having done so.

Cars need names. GOP, too?
February 11, 2019 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Asheville Daily Planet, February 2019
I spent the last 25 years of my working life naming things. My team named hundreds of products and companies – from NationsBank to a paint color for an airline. We had a good run. We never named a car. I never pitched an automaker. Their process is a bog. But I watched with interest from the sidelines. The word “précis” is a real word in English. Properly pronounced, it rhymes with “Tracy.” Well, Mitsubishi came out with a Precis coupe in 1985 (they dropped the acute accent). I remember reading at the time that focus groups couldn’t pronounce it. It seems the last box to be checked was how to say the name! They asked the focus groups how they would pronounce it, and so it was that Precis went to market as “PREE-sus.” I grieved in print when Cadillac assassinated their iconic Eldorado and DeVille in favor of a letter-string system (ATS, CTS, XTS). Now I notice they’ve gone to an alphanumeric system, mostly starting with X. I wait for cooler heads to bring back the icons. Even in retirement, comfy on my mountain, I’ll mutter, “Nice,” to a new name on TV, or, more commonly, “How much did they pay for that dog?” The Nissan Armada, for example. Armada? Top of mind, the Armada was a fleet of clunky Spanish warships that set out in 1588 to invade Britain. They had a terrible plan, and when they retreated, storms sank most of the ships. The car looks like a galleon, but why call attention to it? Cressida was an unfaithful wife during the Trojan War. Students of Shakespeare and the classics sighed with relief when Toyota laid her to rest. In the late 1980s, a journalist asked me to rate the names given to four new luxury cars: Acura (from Honda), Infiniti (from Nissan), Lexus (from Toyota) and Sterling (from Britain’s Rover). I quickly applied the naming rules my team lived by. Is the name easy to pronounce? Lexus whacked Acura on that one. Consumers know “accurate,” but they stumble over unfamiliar coinings. Infiniti’s cute spelling took away the immediate recognition of “infinity.” My team liked natural words – we did Workforce tools for Home Depot, for example – but tired old buzzwords like Sterling, no thanks. Lexus understood the power of infrequent letters. They used X and gained a hint of “sex.” We were big users of high-value Scrabble letters. We named the Vyvx subsidiary of Williams Communications, Fazoli’s for Long John Silver’s and Sheenique for Sally Beauty. I rated the four names, in order: Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, Sterling. And that’s pretty much how they prospered. Sterling only lasted a few model years, and Lexus sales are twice both Acura and Infiniti. Those of you who follow this space regularly in the Daily Planet might be wondering what’s happened to the leftish exposition on politics that I usually serve up. Truth is, this column started as branding advice for Republicans. Their party’s name is in trouble. It no longer carries the strong conservative connotation it did from Barry Goldwater, through the Reagan era, to 2016. Now it’s just a shell where politicians cower and cringe, fearing the next tweet from the president. These elected Republicans don’t really have a choice. The voters at home love Trump. Non-politician Republicans who disapprove of Trump, are lost in space right now. They want to re-Republican the Republican Party. While some have switched party affiliations, most are just waiting to see what happens over the next two years. If Trump is still president leading up to the 2020 election, he will own the party and its name. The re-Repubs stay in space. If, on the other hand, Trump is not in office, then the fight for the Republican shell will be brutal. Trumpists will try to keep the party and name for themselves. If they succeed, the re-Repubs must consider forming a new party, and that means a new name. I’m watching with interest from the sidelines.

WNC’s puzzle in Congress
December 20, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Asheville Daily Planet, January 2019
Mark Meadows made a bid to be Donald Trump’s chief of staff. Trump turned him down. Aw shucks. We came so close to getting rid of a bad congressman. Bad, but how bad? What are his badnesses? Read on. I wrote a column back in 2012, when he was running for Congress, about how Meadows was campaigning against a 1992 UN initiative called “Agenda 21,” a voluntary plan for environmentally-friendly global development. George H.W. Bush signed it for the United States. Meadows bought into dark theories about Agenda 21, that it’s a plot to take away private property rights. Alabama had passed a law calling Agenda 21 a precursor to world government. The word “kook” didn’t appear in my column, except by logical conclusion. In last year’s election campaigns, I noticed that my county’s Democrats were more exercised against Meadows than against (snort) Michele Presnell or (ptui) Ralph Hise. And I noticed that TV commentators, when talking about Meadows’ bid for chief of staff, often mentioned that he’s unpopular in Congress. Why do Democrats wish him gone and congressional Republicans wish he’d never come? I asked Google. An NPR article popped up: “Meadows, 57, has rebelled against the establishment Republican Party. He helped shut down the government in 2013 and oust John Boehner from his House speakership in 2015.” Actually, the media gave Meadows and Senator Ted Cruz equal credit for the 2013 shutdown. Meadows precipitated the crisis with a letter to Boehner, demanding that Obamacare be defunded in the budget. He is reported to have said: “It’s best to close the government in the short term to win a delay on Obamacare, despite the potential negative impact on the economy.” It was his first year in Congress, and he was already doing jumping jacks to attract attention. I think the Obamacare issue is diagnostic of Meadows, as a politician and as a man. He fanatically wanted Obamacare repealed – until he read the Congressional Budget Office report, that the GOP replacement bill would greatly impact coverage for pre-existing conditions. It’s reported that he wept, remembering the experiences of his father and sister. He now favors protecting pre-existing conditions. Meadows tends to be quick and loud on issues and then back away. NPR reports that “Meadows wants to cut off all 10 million Americans who today get federal subsidies to buy health coverage, which he says the country can ill afford.” Obviously, nobody in Meadows’ family gets subsidies. Meadows’ healthcare positions would certainly be one reason for Democratic disapproval. Now try this one on: “How ridiculous is [the idea of global warming] when you have our fighting men and women, they get up and they say, ‘Man, it’s a little chilly, maybe today is the day that we’ve got to worry about climate change.’” He got headlines last year on the Mueller investigation. He tweeted in July: “I just filed a resolution…to impeach Rod Rosenstein.” His words seemed to dance with joy on the page. An Asheville editorial opened like this: “We are routinely appalled by the views of Mark Meadows….Now, however, his actions have gone beyond simply appalling. In his attacks on the Department of Justice, Meadows is targeting the rule of law for political advantage.” (Two weeks later, after consulting GOP leadership, Meadows dropped the impeachment idea and suggested contempt of Congress instead.) He’s often said that he does what his constituents want him to do. Right. But it would be more honest for him to play the sound track of “Showboat” as background to his tweets. Meadows’ bid to work for Trump is puzzling. Is he tired of the Congress gig? Or is he wonder about reelection? Before 2020, the courts will rule on gerrymandering, and the 11th District will likely be drawn fairly. With Asheville back in the district and some red counties gone, he will need an enthusiastic base. But it’s also likely that Trump will be totally discredited
Liberalism: nutty or needed?
November 19, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Asheville Daily Planet, December 2018
Florida’s governor went into a rant: “I won’t stand idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election.”
An old friend sent me an email. She said she was raised “an evangelical, liberal-hating Republican.” She wrote that she’s become disenchanted with Republicans but wasn’t ready to become a Democrat. “I don’t want to be under the same roof with all those wacky liberals,” she said.
Blame Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh for taking a great word from history – “liberal” – and turning it into a hot iron for GOP candidates to brand their opponents with.
A Notre Dame poli sci prof named Patrick Deneen has written a book called “Why Liberalism Failed.” I heard him interviewed on Ezra Klein’s podcast.
The title is an unabashed lure to conservative book buyers. Deneen’s liberalism, that he says failed, goes back to the Enlightenment, to the philosophers whose ideas inspired our Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. They set thing in motion, he says, that resulted in our crumbling society today.
Conservative columnist David Brooks, in his critique of Deneen’s book, wrote: “The liberal democratic moral….stands for the idea that our covenantal institutions — like family, faith, tradition and community — orient us toward higher loves and common dreams that we then pursue in the great gymnasium of liberty.”
Exactly. Our great freedoms are built on the foundation of liberal thought. John Locke, the 17th-century “father of liberalism,” whispered in Jefferson’s ear as he wrote the Declaration of Independence.
An article in The New Yorker magazine last July put it neatly: “Liberalism is a perpetual program of reform, intended to alleviate the cruelty we see around us….[We hope for] a future society, flawed, like our own, but less cruel as time goes on.”
We aspire to ever-greater things, and our basic liberal principles propel us to achieve them. It can be truly said that liberalism contributes something otherwise missing in our government: problem-solving.
Think about it. Democrats – all of whom Gingrich and Limbaugh would call liberals – were in power when all the great and positive changes in American life took place: women’s suffrage, social security, minimum wage, overtime pay, GI Bill, Medicare, Civil Rights Act, on and on.
With full power in Washington for two years, what problems have the Republicans even tried to solve? Securing Social Security? Disaster preparation? Global warming? Healthcare? Strengthening ties with allies? Balanced budgets? None. And the big reason for their failure is their philosophical refusal to confront problems head-on. Government is enemy, not friend. They make a show of doing something when necessary, but their heart isn’t in it.
In today’s America, Democrats are the keepers of our long liberal tradition. No question about that. Republicans look backward to some utopia before the New Deal, when Republican governments helped business but certainly not the people in need!
Democrats now have control in the House of Representatives – which makes me worry. They have opportunities to make life “less cruel” for our people. They can work with Republicans to make healthcare a reasonable reality, for example.
But will they? Many Democrats who worked hard in the recent election are howling for impeachment of Trump, something that would totally distract from the people’s work. Political correctness can result in the elevation of people not ready for leadership. Incoming freshmen could clique together as a power bloc.
It is urgent that Democrats connect themselves with liberalism’s historic difference – namely, how problems get solved, how government meets the needs of the ordinary people who elect them.
Let’s give all those liberal-hating Republicans the positive experience of good liberal government. There’s no better way to heal the divide in our land.
Nothing checked, nothing balanced
October 22, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Asheville Daily Planet, September 2018
This November, we have a chance to save the reputation of the Founding Fathers. Their Constitution is looking old and worn these days.
We hear pundits talking about a “Constitutional crisis” when President Trump has done something forbidden. It’s like these people really believe the line they got in ninth-grade civics class about checks and balances. Relax. We’re not going to have a Constitutional crisis. Nothing’s checked in Washington, and nothing’s balanced.
The Founders did their best. They drew from the great philosophers of the Enlightenment and, incredibly, their plan for their new government has worked pretty well for 240 years.
Now it’s all coming unwound, and we see the Constitution in a new, critical light.
The Constitutional Convention was very low-profile. The superstar Founders – Jefferson, Hancock, both Adamses, Jay, Henry – didn’t attend. (Franklin did, and Washington was chairman.) Hamilton attended sporadically. The press gave scant coverage.
Delegates came and went over the summer of 1787. Some state delegations lacked quorums and so had no vote on issues.
For two months, the Convention debated the principles of an outline James Madison brought. Then a “Committee of Detail” took 10 days to write the first draft – from the Convention’s deliberations but also from many other sources and even ideas, that hadn’t been discussed, that they thought should be included. Ultimately, the Constitution we have was the handiwork of two obscure Founders: South Carolina’s John Rutledge and Pennsylvania’s James Wilson (both later Supreme Court justices).
The issue of keen interest to us today, checks and balances, was intended as a rifle standing beside a vigilant watchman. The gun doesn’t act on its own; it has to be deployed. Madison wrote in Federalist #51:
“The great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others…Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”
As we review the Founders’ work in today’s world, we see the big flaw of the Constitution’s checks and balances system is the power given to the Executive Branch.
The president is commander-in-chief with no real check on his use of the military. He makes appointments, grants pardons, carries out foreign relations – and the compelling one in recent years, the power to issue executive orders, which don’t require congressional approval.
These enormous powers have hung like tempting fruit to all presidents, but few have taken advantage. Andrew Jackson defied the Supreme Court in Indian removal to the West. Abraham Lincoln was a dictator during the Civil War. Congress told Andrew Johnson that he couldn’t remove his secretary of war, but he did anyway. Teddy Roosevelt did what he wanted in Panama. Franklin Roosevelt was an “imperial president.” Executive orders in excess were issued by Barack Obama when he was stonewalled by Senate Republicans, and now Trump issues them like souvenir pens.
Presidential powers are scary there on paper. In the hands of Donald Trump, they’re apocalyptic.
The Founders bungled presidential power – and then they compounded their mistake by making the Legislative Branch’s check on the Executive a virtual impossibility.
It’s relatively easy for the House of Representatives to impeach because their work isn’t final, but the required two-thirds vote for conviction and removal in the Senate is likely only if the president is a raving maniac or a traitor.
If voters elect a Democratic Congress in November, we can move toward what the Founding Fathers hoped for in checks and balances. Republicans have been timid watchmen, no check on Trump’s use of power. Democrats will find ways.
Impeach him? Probably not. Why not? Because the Founding Fathers made the next step, removal, practically impossible.
Corruption with a capital C
October 21, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Asheville Daily Planet, September 2018
If Professor Harold Hill were here today, we’d hear: “Ya got trouble here in America – Corruption with a capital-C, that rhymes with T, that stands for Trump!”
But then here comes Bob the Builder on PBS Kids: “Can we fix it? Yes we can!”
And who’s that with Bob? It’s our Democratic Congress next January! They’re putting on hard hats and singing: “C-O-R-R-U-P-T! That’s the word for G.O.P.!”
Democrats have a rerom plan (read on below), and they’re ready to go.
It’s 2007 over again, when Democrats cleaned up after Tom DeLay’s pay-to-play “K Street Project” and Jack Abramoff’s scams and bribes. The new Democratic majoirty passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. But DeLay and Abramoff were pipsqueaks compared to Donald Trump and his Forty Thieves.
In fact, nothing in our history comes close to the Travesties of Trump.
Teapot Dome, a 1920s scandal that made my sixty-grade history book, was nothing more than a Secretary of the Interior who gave an oil lease in exchange for millions. He covered all his tracks except the bribe itself!
Richard Nixon couldn’t bring himself to destroy the tapes.
Amateurs, these guys were amateurs at scandal.
Trump’s presidency is his cash cow. He kept his business interests and added a D.C. hotel. And fees for members at Mar-a-Lago doubled to $200,000. And he doesn’t cover it up. He’s being who he is.
So when he chose his Cabinet, he did indeed wanted yes-people. But he also wanted people comfortable to him – like Nixon picked Spiro Agnew as his vice-president.
Inauguration Day in 2017, Obama folk, straight arrows for eight years, turned over their crispy clean offices to snorting pigs who headed straight for the public trough to get their share.
Scott Pruitt, our man at Environment Protection, used a private email account to keep in touch with industry cronies, lived in D.C. for $50 a month in a lobbyist’s condo, the junket to Morocco with an entourage – and incidental time in Paris.
Health Services Tom Price chartered aircraft for trips when commercial flights were available.
Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin took his wife and an entourage on a nine-day frolic in Europe that included free Wimbledon tickets. And doctored emails were involved, too.
It’s like a corruption contagion. The boss himself practices greed in the open, and his underlings, already inclined that way, catch the virus.
To all this, add the grassroots corruption that came from the Republican National Committee, not Donald Trump – the blatant gerrymandering and voter suppression that took place in states where Republicans had state legislature control and Republican governors.
In late June, Maryland Congressman John Sarbanes and 163 other Democrats filed House Resolution 975, the “By-the-People Resolution” that would do the following (from Sarbanes’ website):
Expanding access to the ballot box;
Promoting national automatic voter registration;
Ending partisan redistricting by establishing state-based, independent commissions;
Restoring the integrity of the Voting Rights Act;
Protecting the integrity of the election system;
Ending the revolving door of special interests into and out of government;
Expanding ethics laws to apply to the president and to promote greater accountability of the chief executive;
Reforming the Office of Government Ethics;
Updating the Lobbying Disclosure Act and prohibiting bundled campaign contributions from lobbyists;
Strengthening bribery laws to guard against public officials profiting from public service;
Empowering small donors and diminishing the influence of big-money campaign donors;
Disclosing “secret money” and promoting transparency of political spending;
Amending the Constitution to reassert Congress’ authority to regulate political spending and overturn the Citizens United ruling;
Preventing foreign interference in our elections;
Restoring function to the Federal Election Commission; and
Strengthening coordination law to prevent candidate-affiliated Super PACs.
If Democrats take the House in November, they will pass these reforms. Then it’s up to Us, the People, to shame a Republican Senate to do the right thing and go along. And failing there, we take the Senate in 2020, when a whole bunch of Senate Republicans are up for reelection, and many will retire.
The Supreme Court on trial
October 21, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Daily Planet, November, 2018
James Buchanan, as president, was a free-wheeling, iconoclastic, vacillating, white supremacist Northerner. Yeah, a lot like Donald Trump.
And he made one gigantic misjudgment about the Supreme Court – one that Trump seems to be making now.
As president-elect in 1857, Buchanan badly wanted the issue of slavery to be over and done with before he took office. At the time, a lawsuit had made its way to the Supreme Court, Dred Scott v. Sanford, in which a slave in Missouri wanted his freedom because his master, a U.S. Army surgeon, had held him in free states. The unwritten rule at the time was, “Once free, always free,” but Missouri courts had ruled him still a slave.
Five justices on the Court wanted to decline consideration, but Chief Justice Roger Taney, with Buchanan’s encouragement, wanted to use the case to decide the issue of slavery.
Taney wrote an astounding opinion. He reasoned that since, at the time of the Constitution, blacks “were regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations, and so far unfit that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” He said that blacks never were and never can be citizens, so Dred Scott had no standing to sue for his freedom.
Six other justices concurred. All seven on the winning side were Southerners or were “doughfaces” appointed by Southern presidents. The Court was blindly partisan.
Taney’s opinion was exactly what Buchanan wanted. He thought the American people would accept the Court’s decision as final, and so the slavery issue would go away.
He was wrong, so very wrong. Instead, the American people recognized the Supreme Court as nothing but partisan politicians in black robes. And we got the Civil War.
Partisan politicians in black robes. That’s not how the Founding Fathers intended things to go. They intended checks and balances, separation of powers, an independent judiciary that makes impartial judgments.
Brett Kavanaugh gives conservatives a 5-4 edge on the Court. But the question before us now is not about conservatives and liberals. It’s about Trump and Trumpism. Will our Supreme Court be independent, or will it be sucked into Trump’s orbit – like the Republican-controlled Congress has been?
I have no doubt that Trump will try to muscle the Court, like Buchanan did. But will he be successful?
Republicans will hold the Senate, where his soulmate, Mitch McConnell, shares his contempt for tradition and rules. The Senate will not just be compliant; they will be complicit in efforts to gain partisan power. And Congress has frighteningly broad powers to restructure itself – and the other two branches.
However, if Democrats take the House of Representatives, congressional pressure on the Court will be mostly neutralized.
Ultimately, everything will lie with the Court. Make no mistake: the five conservatives on the Court are really, really conservative. It’s expected that the new Court will do the usual conservative things, like siding with the rich and corporations over ordinary people. They won’t repeal Citizens United v. FEC. But will they be Trump Republican partisan?
Nobody knows. If we see them stifling Mueller findings, for example, we will hear Dred Scott’s name called a lot. Like Roger Taney’s Court in 1857, our Court will have no legitimacy. And Trump will replay Buchanan. Slits in our national fabric will widen. Most Americans will be enraged. And this animosity could find its way into the Court itself, with justices sniping publicly.
After the Dred Scott decision, Justice Benjamin Curtis, one of the two dissenters, resigned from the Court, the only justice ever to do so. That’s exactly the atmosphere that a partisan judiciary engenders.
James Buchanan got what he wanted in the Supreme Court, and the country got the Civil War. Now Trump has what he wants with Kavanaugh. He expects a nodding majority. What will he get? And what will happen to us?
Footnote: CBS News ranked the 45 U.S. presidents. James Buchanan was #44, next to last. Donald Trump was ranked #45.
History will judge our times
July 19, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Daily Planet, August 2018
When now is history, I’ll be dead and gone.
And, man, I’d really love to know what’s going to be said and written, say, 50 years from now about the days we’re in now. Things happen every day that have never happened before.
Superficially, history tells us how things turned out. Richard Nixon resigned August 9, 1974. But with the passage of time, historians have described the details that brought him down.
Our own superficial history begins on November 8, 2016, and every day we strain to try and figure how things will turn out.
North Carolina in the spring of 1861 was like our time today. Several southern states had seceded from the Union but not North Carolina. Our General Assembly was opposed to secession. A referendum to hold a convention to consider secession was voted down. Only plantation centers in Eastern Carolina were in favor. A Wilmington newspaper editorialized that “South Carolina has been nothing but trouble from the beginning. We must not follow them.”
But when President Lincoln called for North Carolina to give troops to help put down the rebellion in other Southern states, everything changed. The North Carolina History Project tells of Zebulon Vance at the moment he heard about Lincoln’s troop request: “With arms upraised, (Vance) was pleading for the preservation of the Union: ‘When my hand came down from that impassioned gesticulation,’ he said, ‘it fell slowly and sadly by the side of a secessionist.’”
North Carolina, and WNC in particular, had no enthusiasm for secession. And many who voted for secession in the convention knew the Confederacy would destroy the South. And it’s telling that after the vote for secession, the convention also voted not to put the question to the people in another referendum.
It all came down to decisions. When leaders make decisions, they bring good or ill for their people. Our state’s leaders’ decision to go with Southern neighbors over the Union (for reasons I can’t understand) was terrible. In the end, reluctant North Carolina contributed more men and supplies to the Confederacy than any other state, and we suffered more casualties.
If we put ourselves back in 1861, reading a newspaper, we can feel their anger, their fears, their bewilderment. What’s wrong with those people we sent to Raleigh?
Almost precisely what we feel right now about our government in Washington.
One-third of Americans are so loyal to President Trump that they support him even when he says and does things that are not in our national interest. They believe his obvious lies. They trust him when corruption is all around him. And their devotion scares Republican lawmakers out of their wits – and their Constitutional responsibilities.
We’re bewildered. Like our forefathers in 1861, we’re angry and often pessimistic. We think of great nations that have fallen from within.
People in 1861 were right to worry. Their leaders would make the horrendous decision to secede. And we are right to worry about the decision that Republicans have made not to check President Trump. Their timidity is shameful by any measure.
We look with hope to November and a possible Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives. If they control House committees, they can call for answers. They can change Washington.
The Mueller Report will tell us a lot about criminals and traitors. History will tell us everything. Is Republican silence and inaction out of fear of their constituents, as supposed, or are they really hoping that Russian interference will rescue them in November? Historians will find out. Is President Trump’s irrationality from senility? Or will they find he has no American patriotism, only his self-interest?
Will spineless D.C. Republicans be consigned to the same rubbish heap as those who didn’t confront slavery in the Nineteenth Century? Will Limbaugh and Fox News be a laughing stock? Will Trump’s one-third stay with him if thick turns to thin? Who will be seen as heroes of our democracy?
I’d love to know. My grandchildren will.
“Enabling” Trump
July 12, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
July 11, 2018
In March of 1933, Germany’s Reichstag parliament voted itself out of business. They – the legislative branch – passed the Enabling Act that gave the executive branch – Adolf Hitler – total power. By summer, all non-Nazi parties were banned, leftist party leaders were imprisoned and the army had pledged loyalty to Hitler personally.
I have been optimistic that Donald Trump’s shadow will pass away with no lasting impact on our democracy. That was before three recent 5-4 partisan decisions by the Supreme Court and the resignation of Justice Kennedy. This new Court, with a new Trump appointee, can’t be trusted to be a constitutional check.
And what if Republicans win November elections? Will this GOP Congress be any kind of check on the man who pulled them through?
One other thing: the Enabling Act happened because of the “national emergency” when the Reichstag was mysteriously torched. Do we think our president would shy away from creating an emergency?
The only sho-nuff check on Trump’s authoritarianism is a Democratic House of Representatives – not for impeachment but for majorities in crucial committees that oversee the Executive Branch. The big election is November 3rd. We, and everybody we know, must vote. Every Republican is vulnerable.
History will judge McConnell]
July 2, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
July 1, 2017 [Reprinted now because of McConnell’s new antics]
History rarely makes note of Senate Majority Leaders. Henry Cabot Lodge broke through into history because he squelched America’s joining the League of Nations.
In a future time, Mitch McConnell’s weak double chin will illustrate a section in history titled, “Congress Ceases to Function.” History will give some detail: how Democrats followed long tradition and worked with George W. Bush on his tax cut bill, even though they disapproved, to make it better – and then how McConnell shut down the legislative process right after the 2010 election, when Democrats no longer had a filibuster-proof majority.
McConnell held the filibuster as a constant threat to anything President Obama wanted to do, so nothing got done. He chose to obstruct rather than compromise. He refused Obama’s call for a bipartisan reaction to Russia’s meddling before the last election.
But wait! There’s an alternative history. Democrats could take over the Senate in 2020 – possible, even likely – and McConnell’s place in history will fade away as Democrats reinstate bipartisanship..
Or the recent drubbing of McConnell’s no-compromise healthcare bill could lead to Bipartisan Now, a mutiny of right-minded Republicans joining right-minded Democrats who shame the partisans on both sides and find a historic solution.
Wisdom isn’t welcome among us
June 30, 2018 / Durwood / 0 Comments	
Daily Planet, July 2018
The only light in the one-room house was a tiny flame that bounced on a kerosene wick lamp. The door and windows were shut against the night. The cook fire in the far corner sent a slow thread of smoke up to the thatched roof, where it broke into countless fingers, each probing a way to escape. The 13 men seated along the walls were smoking their usual blend of tobacco and guava leaves. I closed my burning eyes and relied on my ears to tell me who was speaking.
These were the nankedakay, “the old men,” the elders, gathered to “level out” a dispute in the community. I was included, they joked, as the potent cup of rice beer made its rounds, because I had “the forehead of an old man.”
They needed no light. Most of them were barely literate, and besides, the local brand of justice required no documents. The facts of the case were known to everyone in this village of 35 houses. Everyone knew precedent cases. And the record of their decision would be stored in the remarkable memories of the participants.
The owner of the house where we were gathered had died the week before and, by tradition, all his property – rice paddies, coffee groves, banana patches and animals, if any – was to be divided equally among his three children. But the younger son protested. He had cared for their father during his final months, he said, and besides (he added in quiet tones to the elders), he had raised the pig that fed the guests at their father’s funeral.
I witnessed cases that took so long for consensus that the elders had to send out for another jar of rice beer. This one did not. The elders awarded the younger son a small paddy down by the river that otherwise would have gone to his sister – who, the elders noted, had only seldom visited her father during his illness. The sibling disagreement was over.
This incident took place 54 years ago in the Philippines. As a young missionary linguist describing this mountain language, I was specially privileged: I observed Wisdom in all her glory.
Wisdom has been much on my mind lately. Maybe it’s like money: you don’t think about it until there isn’t any.
The elders in my Philippine village had the ability to draw broad lessons from a deep well of life experience. Together, they applied an informed common sense, for the benefit of their community.
Their kind of wise leadership is not welcome among us today. Our leaders have developed a value system that shuts out wisdom – a horribly virulent strain of greed for power and more power. Wisdom cannot breathe that kind of selfish air.
America has known wise leadership. Abraham Lincoln knew that Reconstruction had to be a national healing. FDR gave security to the common man. They saw a long view beyond their immediate problems.
I wonder if Trump supporters weren’t looking for this kind of leadership in 2016 – someone they could trust to shake things up for the better. If so, they didn’t get it. To him, collective wisdom is a wimp. He’s guided by his gut, his daily whims. He has no long vision, only the four month until November’s elections. The Washington swamp is now a cesspool of crony criminals. Everything he does – and I repeat, everything – is to enhance his own position, especially with his faithful.
And I will declare ditto for the arrogant, gerrymandered Republicans in Raleigh.
We will soon be looking for new leadership. Our next president must be wise. He or she must not pander to the short-term selfishness of our time. They should talk of long-term – no, eternal – principle.
I notice Democrats looking for charisma. How often does glamor and wisdom coexist in a person? Two of our wisest presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman, succeeded to the office by a president’s death, not by election. I pray for somebody who will beat Trump – but not just anybody.
Is there wisdom in what I say here? You judge.

Environmental protection belongs to the public: A vision for citizen science at EPA
Citizen Science
Oral Presentation
Prepared by
Contact Information: [email protected]; 202-564-6058
ABSTRACT
The National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT)’s 28 members—representatives of academia; business and industry; nongovernmental organizations; and state, local and tribal governments—have spent the last year researching, interviewing and drafting advice and recommendations on citizen science for the US Environmental Protection Agency. The report identifies citizen science as an invaluable opportunity for EPA to strengthen public support for EPA’s mission and the best approach for the Agency to connect with the public. The report recommends that EPA embrace citizen science as a core tenet of environmental protection, invest in citizen science for communities, partners, and the Agency, enable the use of citizen science data at the Agency, integrate citizen science into the full range of work of EPA. This presentation will outline the core themes of the NACEPT report, including principles and strategy for integrating citizen science into science and policy at the national level, and provide an overview of the specific steps recommended to EPA by NACEPT.

I’m detecting a trend.

Given the odds, here’s a few suggestions from an admittedly edu-centric bystander on what the Mayor can do to improve… Continue reading A Few Suggestions for Mayor de Blasio’s Second Term Education Agenda

Does Donald Trump’s Support for Choice Have to Be Bad for Charter Schools?
December 5, 2016 Alina AdamsLeave a comment	
Charter schools are a controversial topic in New York City, although their supporters range from wealthy Wall Street contributors to middle-class parents looking for a more rigorous academic environment to underserved families desperate to escape their local, failing public schools. They also face opposition from all three demographics, proving that they’re an issue whose base… Continue reading Does Donald Trump’s Support for Choice Have to Be Bad for Charter Schools?

Margaret Thatcher on the European Community Relations 1987 – 1990

On the European Community Relations 1987 – 1990
Thatcher was beginning to see the harmful features of the European community in her second term. Thatcher feared the re-emergence of the Franco-German axis, inclinations towards bureaucratic solutions, and the EU’s ambition for power, a protectionist agenda and covert federalism. The German reunification made the Franco-German axis more lopsided: German dominance was certain. State interventionism in the Christian Democratic government disturbed Thatcher. She feared the corporatism of the EU. Thatcher was blamed for Brussels failures.
M. Chirac called Thatcher a ‘bitch’. Chirac had made the Gaullists a right-of-centre party committed to free enterprise. Chirac and Mitterrand were torn in France. Neither wanted to risk the agricultural vote as they vyied for the Presidency of France. The French election campaign put the rivalry in full swing. Thatcher noted that neither could be seen in the same room together. Mitterrand won the election and the disputes were over (1988); the EU could continue to function somewhat. They agreed on a 1.3% GNP for Community resources. Thatcher wanted effective and legally binding controls on expenditure, measures to reduce agricultural surpluses in which automatic price cuts were the principle weapon and make sure that Britain’s rebate, which had saved Britain 3 billion pounds in the past three years would be secure.
Thatcher was extremely sceptical about giving Brussels control over the British currency. The EMU (economic and monetary union), Central Bank and other centralizing tendencies in the EU were unsavoury to Thatcher. Then Thatcher gave her Bruges Speech. Thatcher’s speech clearly slowed the process of integration. She felt that Jacque Delor stopped being a functionary (bureaucrat) and became a political spokesman for federalism.
The blurring of these roles is common on the continent. Scepticism was high in Thatcher mind. She had to ask if the British democracy, parliamentary sovereignty, common law, our traditional sense of fairness, our ability to run our own affairs in our own way might be subordinated to the demands of a remote European bureaucracy, resting on very different traditions? Thatcher despised the European ideal. Thatcher found it ironic that despite the suffering of the Eastern European countries, West Germany etc insisted on centralization. Thatcher rejected the idea of a “European super-state exercising a new dominance for Brussels. Willing and active cooperation between independent sovereign states is the best way to build a successful European community. Thatcher warned of the EU replacing NATO. Thatcher believed in a family of nations not one homogenising nation. Thatcher highlights the negatives of EU members such as Germany, France and Greece (with its financial scandal).
Thatcher claimed the French Revolution was not as revolutionary at the 1688 Revolution of England. Thatcher was set to attend the 200-year anniversary of the violent, horrible revolution, which led to Napoleonic rule and further suffering in Europe. Thatcher genuinely claimed that the French Revolution was nothing to celebrate really. Human rights were not developed by the French, she told a French newspaper. She also handed Mitterrand a copy of the A Tale of Two Cities because it explained her point most clearly.
Thatcher explains the Franco-German axis as a rising serpent destined to destroy England. Thatcher emphasizes that political union is now envisaged alongside monetary union. Behind political union lies with the Franco-German axis. They envisage a stronger European Council with more majority voting: but they did not want to see the powers of the Commission or the European Parliament increased. The French were federalist on grounds of tactics rather than conviction. The Germans wanted political union for different reasons and by different means. For the Germans, the price of quick reunification with East Germany on their own terms and with all the benefits which would come through Community membership (Germany would not behave like Hitler’s or Bismarck’s Old Germany). Germans were federalists by conviction while the French were senior partners: Germany was dominant. Thatcher is opposed to political union of either kind. Political union in a European Parliament must not mean the reduction of the role of NATO. Thatcher rejected Delors view of a federal Europe in which the European Parliament would be the Community’s House of Representatives, the Commission its Executive, and the Council of Ministers its Senate. “No, no, no,’ said Thatcher in the House of Commons.

Opinion: Even When Process Is Due, It May Not Mean Justice
Any talk of chipping away at due process should scare us, though the law hasn’t always worked

Save for later
I remember it so clearly, though I was just a girl when the 1960s scene unfolded: My parents returning from a church dance in good spirits and being met with bad news and a bit of hysteria from the rest of the family. My brother Tony had been arrested for wanting to be seated and served at the Double T Diner in my home state of Maryland.
My parents and members of Tony’s civil rights group were able to get Tony home; my parents had the deed to the house ready, in case they needed it for bail.
And it was all legal, all done with “due process,” following the trespass laws of the time that allowed segregation in public businesses whose owners decided which members of the public they served. Thanks to the efforts of activists like my three oldest siblings — who broke the rules they and many others believed were unjust and contrary to America’s ideals — those laws are no longer on the books.
But this was life in the United States of America, when the police — whose salaries my parents indirectly paid — could be called to haul someone off to jail for craving a burger and fries because one person said, “You are not allowed in.”
Though it was not that long ago, the folks whose families were not touched seem to want to ignore how devastating it can be to a country and its citizens when its policies favor or disfavor certain people — indeed, entire groups of people.
When some Americans brush aside the president’s call to suspend due process for those seeking asylum on the southern border, despite the legal rights extended to all persons, not just citizens, in national and international law, it might not seem like that big a deal. They might think due process exemption could never touch them, their families or friends because they do things the right way.
But it sends a chill through those who realize where that kind of thinking can lead — has led.
Watch: Trump Asks GOP Lawmakers for Border Wall Funding
Misrule of law
This week’s Supreme Court ruling that approved the Trump administration’s travel ban while ignoring his statements demonizing Muslims ironically spurred a reminder of an unjust time in America’s not that distant past, when the same court approved the World War II era internment of Americans of Japanese descent, including citizens.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts finally tossed out that ruling against Fred Korematsu, an action that Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissenting in the travel ban case, praised even while pointing out the similarities between then and now. In both cases, she wrote, the court deferred to the Trump administration’s invocation of “an ill-defined national security threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweeping proportion,” relying on stereotypes about a particular group amid “strong evidence that impermissible hostility and animus motivated the government’s policy.”
When turning a not unrelated gaze on the confusing scene at the U.S. southern border, it looks complicated. There are legitimate legal and constitutional interpretations when it comes to the issue of illegal immigration, and how and where one arrives. For example, the rules for refugees differ from ones for those seeking political asylum. And as explained in a New York Times primer, the Department of Homeland Security under current policy can use criteria for expedited removal of undocumented migrants.
You can be appalled at the laughter that greeted Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ icy jokes about separating children from parents and also have concerns about border safety and immigration policy. But Americans should be able to see every man, woman and child as individual human beings, with different circumstances — and recognize the need for more caution instead of a decision to throw caution to the wind.
It was the due process of a court challenge and judgment that led this week to an order to reunite separated families in 30 days, or 14 days for children under 5 years old.
Considering what this country has done under protection of law, who could be confident that things will turn out OK when due process is suspended for any reason?
What is due
Some of this concern is personal. If the government chooses who does and does not deserve certain rights, I’m pretty sure this African-American woman would be judged to be on the “wrong” side of “them” vs. “us,” though my ancestors have been here for generations.
I also see the sad humor in knowing that my husband, whose grandfather managed to make it across the Atlantic Ocean on a boat at the turn of the last century, would be considered an exemplary “us,” since that granddad came from Norway, the equivalent of a golden ticket in Trump’s America. Come to think of it, Trump’s own family members, by blood and marriage, were pretty late to the American party as well, but get nary a side-eye.
A lot of this concern, though, is patriotic.
To be exceptional, countries have to be vigilant, and not set up entire races and types of people as the “other,” as invaders, as not deserving of the rights that make America great, at least when we manage, kicking and screaming, to adhere to them.
When NFL players protesting police brutality are told they should, perhaps, leave their country, even as a Pennsylvania police officer is charged with shooting in the back an unarmed black teenager running from a traffic stop, then what chance does an asylum seeker fleeing violence have to be heard?
That’s why any talk of chipping away at due process for anyone is scary to me, and should be even for those secure and far too complacent in the knowledge that they would never find themselves on the wrong side of that dividing line.
In 2018, my brother is considered a hero, willing to break the law for the greater American good. But at the time, knowledge of what should be didn’t give him or my parents any power or comfort.

President-elect Donald Trump appears much more supportive of nuclear energy (and mining in general) than Hillary Clinton; she is pretty much ‘agnostic’. Significant infrastructure spending, energy independence and deregulation to cut back bureaucratic costs and red tape are all key policies Trump is looking to push through during his presidency.
Furthermore, two of Trump’s close advisors, Senator Jeff Sessions and Donald Hoffman are strong supporters of nuclear energy development. Hoffman, who is now on the short list of potential candidates to become Secretary of Energy, is the President and CEO of Excel Services Corp, a nuclear engineering and consulting firm he founded in 1985. Having previously served on the Board of Directors and as President of the American Nuclear Society, he also remains a very active member of the Society which consists of 15,000 nuclear scientists, engineers and specialists. Clearly, there is a strong potential case for nuclear under a Trump presidency. That development should be positive for not only America’s nuclear industry but also for North American uranium mining companies.
There has been much gnashing of teeth regarding the sub $20 uranium spot price. Not to worry. Thanks to the US Department of Energy bartering uranium reserves for services, the price decline is likely to be viewed as an overreaction. Couple that action with the fact that virtually none of the positive planks over the last five years espoused to cause the rise of the uranium price have materialized yet and everyone looks to have thrown in the towel.
Whither Uranium?
Let’s build the case and conclude why investors should have uranium exposure, particularly with companies that have executed impressive growth strategies and deals during this challenging time. Nuclear energy will undoubtedly become a bigger sector globally over the coming years. China is leading the charge here with plans to build 110 reactors by 2030, a massive USD $100 billion undertaking. India plans for nuclear to provide 25% of its power by 2040. South Korea’s 25 current reactors provide a third of the country’s electricity and they are planning to bump this up to 70% by 2030. Even the oil capital of the world, Saudi Arabia has plans to go nuclear with 16 reactors slated to come online by 2030.
Back to the situation in the USA, American producers through the Uranium Producers of America (UPA) are lobbying for a law that limits DOE stockpile sales contending that:
“The DOE is selling the taxpayers’ uranium and conversion inventories via barter transactions to fund decontamination and decommissioning operations for defunct enrichment facilities, which previously supplied defense and later utility enrichment services.”
The barter transactions are contributing to extreme downward pressure on uranium and conversion market prices by effectively dumping the excess uranium material inventory into the market at prices below production costs. This has been a big factor in the rapid decline of the uranium spot price in recent years.
The amount of uranium from barter transactions is well more than current domestic production levels.
Furthermore, the U.S. utility industry has already paid for decontamination and decommissioning expenses through toll enrichment contracts and then again with well over $2.2 billion collected under the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
It appears the UPA has a strong case and even the current US Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, is aggressively lobbying for significant funds to advance nuclear technology. With the incoming Trump administration, the developments benefiting the uranium market and the nuclear industry could very well be expedited.
Yet the uranium spot price has been in decline from its peak of $136 / lb in 2007 and is now trading near its all-time low in real terms at $18.75 / lb. One of the main drivers for this price decline has been an oversupplied secondary market but this is transient in nature and a reversal of this trend could very well be now underway.
2004 Redux
Price turnaround will happen for all the previous stated reasons and the fundamentals, that will drive this price action, are stronger than ever. Important to note that the bulk of uranium bought and sold by utilities and producers is done through long term contracts. A lot of these contracts supplying nuclear utilities with uranium to fuel the reactors are expiring over the coming years with over 75% of the current contracts set to expire by 2025. This means that utilities must come back to the market to contract supply going forward for their reactors and as we have seen in the past, this will drive the price higher.
Currently, the state of the uranium market looks eerily like 2004 when capitulation set the stage for a massive run up in the uranium price shortly thereafter. Spot was trading around $20 / lb then and by early 2007, the spot price hit $136 / lb. A key factor in this was utility contracting

Rick Kusmirski, P. Geo, M.Sc., Head Geologist for Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: SYH) (OTC Pink: SYHBF) (Frankfurt: SC1N) agrees. He was previously Exploration Manager of Cameco Corporation's (TSX: CCO) uranium exploration projects in the Athabasca Basin before running JNR Resources which was acquired by Denison Mines Corp. (TSX: DML) in 2012.
“In 2003-4, everyone pretty much gave up given the depressed spot price. Unlike other metals, supply security is critical for uranium. These contracts are established for years with fixed negotiated prices. Current contract expirations are at the $40-$50 / lb. level and new contracts will reflect closer to those values than the spot price’.
Another factor contributing to the prolonged uranium bear market that could turnaround is Japan, which has almost 50 nuclear reactors still idled with only 2 back online. This has been the “holy grail” for an immediate runaway uranium price for the last five years and has set just about every equity analyst on a fruitless quest for price recovery. Needless to say, this has not occurred yet but remains an important catalyst for the price going forward: Several of these idled reactors having recently been approved for restart.

Canon Bryan, CFO and Director of Terrestrial Energy as well as a highly respected uranium industry expert, is somewhat constructive on the sector, but feels it will take a major ‘shock’ to kickstart it. That could be several things, such as Japan tooling up or India and China speeding up reactor construction. He did say that China is a moving like a steaming train and could well accelerate its nuclear buildup plans.
Further, Canon said a negative shock such as some political issue in Kazakhstan, which supplies approx. 40% of the world’s uranium, could positively affect the price:
“The price of uranium today is surprising to many in the industry. What has been unexpected is Japan's refusal to turn its nuclear power plants back on. It has been over 5 years and only 2 of their reactors are providing power today. The effects on Japan's economy and its emissions are horrendous. Other problems for uranium markets have presented themselves as well, such as selling of uranium stockpiles by the US Department of Energy.”
However, upon understanding the sector, it makes sense to gain exposure. There seems little doubt that the stagnating primary mine supply in combination with the growing demand will result in shortages for years down the road.
The Athabasca Basin and Skyharbour Resources
Where is the current and future nuclear reactor base going to get its long term, secure supply of uranium from? Fortunately, there is a geological anomaly in the heart of geopolitically-favourable Canada called the Athabasca Basin which happens to host the highest-grade uranium deposits in the world.
Despite a declining commodity price environment recently, the Athabasca Basin has allowed a handful of exploration companies to flourish. Recent success stories like NexGen Energy, Fission Uranium, Alpha Minerals and Hathor Exploration have collectively created over $1.5 billion in value for investors and exemplify the unique opportunity Athabasca Basin uranium exploration companies can offer investors through the discovery process. One of the few companies left out there looking to emulate these successes and generate significant shareholder value through exploration and making new high grade uranium discoveries is Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: SYH).
The Company, and its CEO Jordan Trimble, have used recent weakness in the uranium market to build up a top tier asset base in the Basin at attractive valuations, assemble a strong, focused management and technical team, and to lay the ground work to benefit from the turnaround in the market.
“What we’ve been able to do over the last four years is to capitalize on this unprecedented bear market. We've now accumulated five projects, covering over 250,000 hectares of prospective land at pennies on the dollar. The valuation we’ve been able to get these projects at is less than $2.5 million in cash and stock. The five projects have had over $60 million invested in them in historical exploration. The strategy is now to go and value-add the projects through exploration and drilling.”
It’s worth noting that Skyharbour’s Head Geologist, Rick Kusmirski (or “Radioactive Rick” as he is nicknamed), employed a similar strategy in the early 2000’s with his company JNR Resources and benefited from the inevitable turnaround in the uranium market resulting in a share price increase from 5 cents to over $4 in 2007. To provide some context, two projects now in Skyharbour’s portfolio known as Moore Lake and Falcon Point constituted the flagship projects for JNR Resources in the mid-2000’s which boasted a +$300 million market cap. Skyharbour currently trades at a $12 million market cap and owns three other projects in the Basin as well. Furthermore, Skyharbour has advanced some of its properties through strategic partnerships with other companies.
CEO Jordan Trimble says the company will continue to employ this prospect generator strategy on its non-core assets which will allow for additional exploration financed by other companies, stock/cash payments made to Skyharbour, and more news flow going forward with Skyharbour retaining a carried interest and upside exposure in the projects.
image: http://www.stockhouse.com/getattachment/d582e087-1492-41e8-8983-748fcc241c31/beatty4_resized.jpg
Skyharbour's flagship project is the Moore Lake Uranium Project being optioned from Denison Mines which is also a large, strategic shareholder of the Company. A high-grade uranium pod called the “Maverick Zone” was discovered by JNR Resources led by Skyharbour’s head geologist Rick Kusmirski with drill results including 4.03% eU3O8 over 10 metres at approx. 260 metres depth. Skyharbour will be commencing its first drill program on the project in early 2017. The Company also owns a 100% interest in the Falcon Point Uranium Project on the east side of the Basin which hosts a shallow NI 43-101 inferred uranium and thorium resource as well as a high-grade surface showing at the north end of the property where recent grab samples returned up to 68% U3O8.
On the west side of the Basin, Skyharbour owns a 50% interest in the large Preston Uranium Project strategically located near Fission Uranium’s Patterson Lake South high-grade Triple R deposit as well as NexGen Energy’s high grade Arrow deposit. Approx. $5 million in exploration has been carried out to date on the property delineating over a dozen drill targets with partner companies having funded the bulk of this work.
Skyharbour’s project base is unique for a company of its size in that it has high grade uranium mineralization in drill core at its flagship Moore Lake project, an NI 43-101 compliant uranium and thorium deposit at its Falcon Point project, and one of the largest land packages proximal to the high-grade deposits being defined by NexGen and Fission on the west side of the Basin.
But it’s not just the property portfolio that is impressive; the team is a real highlight for the company. President and CEO Jordan Trimble, CFA, and Chairman Jim Pettit run the company out of Vancouver having previously sold their gold company Bayfield Ventures to New Gold on the back of a high-grade gold discovery in Ontario. Head Geologist Rick Kusmirski and his technical team in Saskatoon have many decades of experience focused on uranium exploration in the Athabasca Basin with several discoveries under their belt. Director David Cates is the current President and CEO of Denison Mines which is the largest, strategic shareholder of Skyharbour Resources. And Strategic Advisor Paul Matysek is well known name in the industry having built and sold four mining companies in the last decade including Energy Metals Corp. which grew from a $10 million market cap in 2004 to approximately $1.8 billion when it was acquired by Uranium One in 2007.
The Skyharbour and Denison Moore Lake Deal
Skyharbour recently raised $2.4 million to fund the upcoming drill program at the flagship Moore Lake project. The Company is well structured with 44 million shares out and some of the larger shareholders include Denison Mines, Marin Katusa and the KCR Fund, Doug Casey, OTP Fund Management, and the management and insider group which collectively own approx. 20% of the company.
In August, Skyharbour did an impressive deal with Denison, granting Skyharbour an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Moore Lake project for stock and cash as well as $3.5 million in exploration over the next five years. Denison retains a claw-back option for 51% by spending over twice Skyharbour’s expenditures, illustrating their view that the property still has a lot of value yet to be unlocked through the drill bit.
image: http://www.stockhouse.com/getattachment/59020916-090d-45e3-8890-5e7303cabb95/beatty5_resized.jpg
“Partnering with Skyharbour is the perfect way to ensure Moore Lake continues to be explored for potentially significant mineralization,” stated Denison’s CEO David Cates in a July 2016 press release who is also now a Director of Skyharbour. “While Denison wasn't actively looking to sell its position in the Moore Lake property, we couldn't pass on an opportunity to join forces with the dynamic leadership team at Skyharbour and their strong and well thought out plans to take Moore Lake through the next phase of exploration."
One of the key catalysts coming up for Skyharbour is the drill program slated to commence in January at Moore Lake. The Company intends to go back into the Maverick Zone and expand on the known high grade pod with a focus on testing mineralization below the unconformity in the basement rock where many recent discoveries in the Basin have been made. The drilling will also test several other high priority targets looking for additional high grade discoveries. Skyharbour has a share price of $0.28 and a market cap of $12 million while Denison trades at $0.63 and a market cap of $336 million.
Conclusion
Once the ice roads are set up in January, Skyharbour will commence its drill program at Moore Lake. With the Athabasca Basin having the highest grades in the world and previous drill holes on the project having yielded grades of up to 5% U3O8 (far more than the 0.1% global deposit average) the next 6 months will be pivotal for Skyharbour.
The deal with Denison on Moore Lake is highly accretive for the Company’s shareholders as it adds a high-grade uranium property with strong exploration upside potential to the portfolio to complement the other uranium projects Skyharbour holds in the Basin.
Over the last five years, the uranium spot price has confounded, almost defied analyst projections. In 2004 there were similar emotions and sentiment. As we saw, with much less projected growth, the spot went up almost 7-fold in two years. Much ink has been spilled on the Fukashima factor. Would the price have gone even higher if there hadn’t been the tsunami? Who knows? Water under the bridge now.
Skyharbour offers more than just a compelling investment opportunity in a deeply discounted sector. The Company’s management has shown a unique ability to raise money in what is a very tough market. Management under Jordan Trimble has exploited the uranium market weakness to build a portfolio of properties and a team that will benefit quickly and decisively once the uranium price trend reverses.
Having high grade discovery potential in the Basin also serves as a bit of a hedge against the declining commodity price as the main company catalyst is exploration success. Time and time again investors have been rewarded handsomely for Athabasca Basin discoveries and the subsequent M and A activity.
With global leaders Cameco, Rio Tinto, Areva and Denison active in the area, the potential for consolidation is compelling and ongoing. Skyharbour is continuing to make prudent long-term decisions and forge strategic relationships in challenging markets that will provide exceptional and consistent shareholder value.

<!- Start of issue 094 include --> PASSING THE SPACE-TRAVEL TORCH
From Editor, J. Douglas Kenyon
In the 1960s and 70s I lived on the east coast of Florida and thus became a lifelong fan of the space program. I watched many launches from Cape Kennedy, including the Apollo 11 and 13 manned missions to the moon. Later, when the space shuttle became the vehicle of choice for the U.S. Government's manned space program, I returned to Florida frequently enough to witness several of those spectacular launches as well.
For me, inclined as I was even then toward a fascination with ancient mysteries and wisdom, such launches took on a heightened spiritual significance. I began to think of the space program as the modern equivalent of pyramid-building. The shuttles, in fact, with their massive three-fold thrusters, brought to mind the ancient concept of kundalini energy, that subtle pranic force said to rise up the human spinal stalk eventually culminating in spiritual freedom and enlightenment. Here also were three rising�potentially explosive�forces dubbed the ida, pengala, and the sushumna. The shuttle, it seemed to me, was an excellent metaphor for such rising energies, leading to the conquest of gravity or transcendence over earthbound consciousness. That idea had more than a little, to do with the ultimate naming of this magazine.
Not surprisingly, I watched the April handover of retired shuttles to various museums around the country with some sadness, and even dismay, as it seemed to me to signal the end of an era. The prospect that we may�at least as far as the government is concerned�be well on our way to abandoning space exploration altogether, seems tragic. There is little consolation in talk of Mars rockets to be developed in the future, at a time when the public may have even less appetite for space travel than it does now, and well beyond the time when the technological advances of the past halfcentury could expect to be adequately preserved.
The continuation of civilization over the long haul has always depended, to a great extent, on the ability of successive generations to pass along their acquired knowledge to the next. To fail to pass the torch of an advanced science is to invite the loss of such knowledge and to descend slowly but surely into darkness.
Some argue that not too many generations after the pyramids of Giza were built, the secrets of their construction were lost, and hence the achievements were never duplicated. The gothic cathedrals of Europe were certainly built by artisans who, despite the barbarism around them, still knew, for a time at least, how to pass their secrets along. In the hidden initiatory rites of the cathedral builders, as well as with other highly skilled�if not necessarily enlightened�guildsmen, specialized knowledge was passed from master, to journeyman, to apprentice in a harmonious cycle of continuous instruction. In such an order, the ignorant could be slowly transformed into the knowledgeable. That order, some believe, has now virtually disappeared.
In today's politically correct society, such methods enjoy little popular support. Few, indeed, seem to respect the value of hard-won knowledge, preferring instead, it appears, the sad equality of a common ignorance. The mere suggestion of benefit from some ancient hierarchical order where the advanced wisdom of the few could be successfully transmitted to the many is dismissed as, at best, archaic, or out-of-touch, old-school.
Nevertheless, on the long and winding road toward planetary liberation, such attitudes could themselves become relics of a forgotten era�yesterday's fashions in attic trunks. In the quest to explore space, for example, already we see independent and enterprising individuals striving to fashion a new vision beyond the reach of an exhausted paternalistic government. Witness the quickly evolving efforts of private companies like Space-X, Orbital Sciences Corporation, and others to replace the space shuttle in servicing the International Space Station. In the meantime, Larry Page and Eric Page, founders of Google, have announced plans to mine the asteroids for platinum and other resources. Hopefully these new pioneers will not fail to pass their torch to the free explorers of the future. (For more see page 12 in this issue, and "Private Space" in AR #93. )

Himalayan Himalayan Glaciers Melting? Not so Fast
Over the last few years, one of the more dire predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)�the United Nations body set up as the world's virtual climate watchdog�was that the glaciers of the Himalayas were melting and could be gone by 2035.

THE FORBIDDEN ARCHAEOLOGIST
Psychic Archaeology in the Sterkfontein Caves
By Michael Cremo
The Sterkfontein Caves in South Africa are now a United Nations World Heritage Site. They first became famous in 1936, when Robert Broom (1866-1951) discovered a skull belonging to the apeman Australopithecus. From the late 1940s through the 1950s, paleontologist John Talbot Robinson (19232001) assisted Broom in discovering more fossil bones of Australopithecus there. Most mainstream scientists now consider Australopithecus, who existed at Sterkfontein about three million years ago, to be an ancestor of modern humans. I do not accept that. There is evidence that humans like us were already existing three million years ago, alongside our supposed apeman ancestor. more...

In 1991, two tourists were hiking off the path between the mountain passes Hauslabjoch and Tisenjoch in the Otztal Alps on the border of Austria. Walking near the edge of a receding glacier around 10,500 feet in elevation, the tourists discovered a body partially exposed in the ice. When authorities came to retrieve the body, they first assumed it was a modern human, perhaps a recently deceased mountaineer; since some glaciers have been receding, they've been revealing other climbers from recent times. Three weeks before, in the same area, the bodies of a man and a woman, missing since 1934, had been discovered. more...

ANCIENT MYSTERIES
Puma Punku Enduring Enigma
Why Does One of the World's Greatest Ancient Mysteries Remain Virtually Unknown?
By Brien Foerster
On the high, arid plains of Bolivia, some 11 km from the southern edge of South America's largest lake, Titicaca, brood the ruins of a once proud human accomplishment, Puma Punku. The name itself derives from the Native Aymara language, still in use by millions, mainly in the rural areas of Peru and Bolivia, and roughly translates as being "Door of the Puma." However, it was most likely constructed by people long before the Aymara, and thus we have no idea what the builders called it. more...

Solar Catastrophe
Did an Outburst from the Sun End the Last Ice Age and Destroy a Forgotten Civilization? Could It Happen Again?
By Robert Schoch, Ph.D.
The conventional satus quo view is that true civilization and high culture dates back to the period of approximately 3500 BC to 3000 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus regions. My work on the Great Sphinx of Egypt broke this barrier in the early 1990s when I demonstrated, using geological data, that the great statue's origins go back thousands of years earlier than previously believed. Egyptologists had dated the Sphinx to the Fourth Dynasty, circa 2500 BC. Initially I "conservatively" (although not so conservative according to my critics) suggested that the core body of the Sphinx dates back to 5000 BC or a bit earlier. Over the years, as I continued my studies and collected more data, I slowly revised my estimate, considering progressively earlier possible dates for the statue. I am now more comfortable considering the notion that possibly the Sphinx's earliest origins go back 10,000 years or more, perhaps even to the period of circa 10,000 BC to 9,000 BC; that is, the end of the last ice age. more...

Were They Simply Monuments to Faith or Something Else?
By Richard Cassaro
The cathedrals of Europe are still one of the most famous and well-known examples of architecture in the Western world.

ALTERNATIVE HISTORY
The Making of the Piri Reis Map
Might It Reveal Clues to the Origins of Civilization?
By Steven Sora
In 1929, in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul (Constantinople), a map drawn over 400 years before was rediscovered. The cartographer was actually an admiral "Re-is" by the name of Piri Ibn Haji Mohammed. The map was unusual in that it had projections of the Americas down to South America and employed correct longitudes. It also had a notation that it was, in part, drawn over a map used by Columbus, just 21 years after he reached the New World. Another notation said that over 20 maps were used to put this chart together including some drawn back in the era of Alexander the Great. more...
ASTROLOGY
Saturn in Scorpio
The Principle of Form Enters the Arena of Pure Energy
By Julie Loar
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Along with Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, Saturn is classified as a gas giant. Much of what we know about Saturn came from the Voyager explorations in 1980-81. Saturn's day is 10 hours, 39 minutes, and the planet is visibly flattened at the poles as a result of this fast rotation on its axis. The atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen, with small amounts of helium and methane, and Saturn is the only planet in our Solar System that is less dense than water. Broad bands in the atmosphere that are similar to, but fainter, than those found on Jupiter, mark Saturn's hazy yellow color. more...

OUT OF THE BLUE:
The Definitive Investigation of the UFO Phenomenon
James Fox
This documentary sets out to prove that Unidentified Flying Saucers (UFOs) of unknown origin and technologies do exist and that there is an active campaign to hide the facts of their existence. Now, this won't be news to UFO buffs of longstanding, of course, but there still may be some who haven't given any serious consideration to this topic, at all. Then, there are the debunkers, as well, who just won't give any serious consideration to this topic, no matter how valid the evidence; and then, too, the hard-core skeptics who doubt and question all the evidence, but at least give the evidence some consideration. more...

About MAT Treatments
About Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid; It can generate the usual opioid agonist effects but, not as greatly as those produced by full agonists, such as heroin and methadone. Full agonist opioids have the risk of side effects, abuse, and addiction. Not only does Buprenorphine have fewer risks, but it can negate all the effects of opioid agonists, and even lessen withdrawal symptoms in an addict whose bloodstream is currently carrying a full agonist.
About Methadone
Methadone treatment programs have many benefits, including: the reduced or stopped use of injection drugs; lowered risk of overdose; lowered rates of disease transmission; increased life expectancy; reduction in risky sexual behaviors; reduced criminal activity; and improved family and social stability.
About Suboxone®
Suboxone is a drug that is used for rehab treatment for individuals that are addicted to pain medication or opiates. Those wishing to use the Suboxone medication rehab plan will first need to make an appointment to be seen by the physician in the rehab center that uses this method. The individual will be checked for physical ailments that may prohibit them from using Suboxone as a treatment. If cleared by the physician the Suboxone rehab treatment will be started.

Pence pick sparks hope for Trump fundraising
Pence pick sparks hope for Trump fundraising
By: Jonathan Swan
Mike Pence's close ties to Charles and David Koch's donor network won’t sway either the billionaires’ attitude or their money toward Donald Trump, a key aide to the network says.
But Republican fundraisers remain cautiously optimistic that as Trump's vice presidential pick, the Indiana governor, who is deeply respected by GOP megadonors, can help the Trump campaign's struggling finance operation.
The Koch brothers aren’t budging on Trump; as much as they like and respect Pence they disapprove of the presumptive GOP nominee more.
Charles Koch told Fortune this week that voting for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was like choosing between cancer and a heart attack.
When asked how Trump’s Pence selection will affect the network’s strategy, Koch network spokesman James Davis told The Hill, “Our efforts will remain focused on the Senate," where the network has already laid down more than $30 million in ad buys in battleground states to save vulnerable Republican senators.
But while he won't move the Kochs, Pence will likely recruit other donors into Trump's corner, top GOP fundraising sources say.
“For fundraising absolutely it helps. He's got great relationships. People will take his calls,” said Lisa Spies, a senior fundraiser for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign who in 2010 helped then-Congressman Pence expand his national fundraising network.
“I think people will give because they like Mike Pence," she added. "But they’re not going to give as much as they would’ve because they dislike Donald Trump."
Trump’s campaign is struggling to build a competitive fundraising operation and the candidate could use as much fundraising juice out of his VP pick as possible.
Trump hates asking fellow billionaires for money, and he spent his entire primary campaign telling the party’s donor class he neither wanted nor needed their cash. He portrayed the political donor class as corrupt; and a number of GOP donors have privately told The Hill they won't be forgetting those slights now that Trump apparently wants their money.
Trump now finds himself up against Clinton, who is outraising him and outspending him by factors unseen in the modern era.
Belatedly and begrudgingly, Trump is building some semblance of a fundraising operation, though fundraisers like Spies still laugh when asked what they think of “Trump’s finance operation.”
"What finance operation?" she says, pointing to the barebones outfit that mostly consists of people who are loyal to the party first and Trump a distant second. It's a pale comparison to the operations built in previous cycles by GOP nominees like Romney and George W. Bush.
Pence can only do so much to change that basic calculus.
One role will likely be as a fundraising surrogate, which is a typical role taken by VP candidates.
The Trump campaign is searching for credible people it can send to dinner parties and events around the country to prospect for cash. Pence fits that job description perfectly.
“Having a vice presidential candidate that has his legislative experience and executive gubernatorial background is a big plus; certainly for fundraising it allows us to have a credible surrogate in addition to the family members of the candidate,” said Ronald Weiser, an influential GOP fundraiser who is a vice chair of Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.
“It’s hard to move the candidate to 50 states,” Weiser said. “If you’re doing an event and the candidate’s not available for political or other fundraisers reasons, then you need a credible surrogate for that event."
Trump had his best fundraising month so far in June — his campaign said it raised more than $20 million, a vast improvement on its paltry $3.1 million take in May — but he’s still getting financially crushed by Clinton, who raised more than $200 million in the primaries and used that money to build a staff tens times the size of Trump's.
On the super-PAC side — the groups that can spend unlimited funds on candidates so long as they don’t coordinate with the candidate or his campaign — Trump is also getting crushed.
Clinton’s allies set up her approved super-PAC, Priorities USA, early in the cycle, and it’s already hammering Trump with brutal attack ads.
The pro-Clinton group has already made advertising reservations exceeding $150 million in battleground states, according to spokesman Justin Barasky.
Trump, meanwhile, is relying on an assortment of super-PACs claiming to support him, but donors privately tell The Hill that they remain suspicious of many of these groups and unclear about which group Trump wants them to support.
No vice presidential candidate can fix all these problems, but Pence's selection is about the best Trump could hope for, and it's already making his ticket more ideologically palatable to mainstream GOP donors.
Pence has the enthusiastic approval from the most admired figure in establishment Republican circles — House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) — and Pence’s selection will be a data point that party leaders like RNC chair Reince Priebus can use to convince skeptical donors that Trump is modulating his behavior for the general election.
The fiscal conservative group Club for Growth, which spent millions trying to defeat Trump in the primaries, nonetheless praised Trump’s selection of Pence.
Further exemplifying a Pence Effect, the Club for Growth — which won’t spend to help Trump in the general election because it doesn't engage in general elections — says Pence's selection might tip some of the group's donors in Trump’s direction, a spokesman said.
“We think Pence would be a great VP, and his addition might make some of our members more inclined to consider the ticket,” said Doug Sachtleben, communications director of the Club for Growth.
“[Pence] had a 95 lifetime score with the Club, so he’s been great on our issues. From an organizational perspective, our focus remains on House and Senate races. We haven’t been involved in presidential general elections before and don’t plan to this time around.”
A conservative leader who is among the best connected in the country among Republican mega-donors told The Hill that Trump couldn’t have made a better choice than Pence.
But the problem for donors, he said, remains the man sitting above Pence on the ticket.
“It helps some. ... Unlike with Trump, there’s a significant degree of respect for Mike Pence’s policy accomplishments," he said.
“It’s positive that it’s Mike Pence, but it doesn’t change the basic calculus of who Donald Trump is.”

Ohio Tea Party Takes Out Full Page Ad in One of Trump’s Favorite Papers Demanding Border Wall Funding
December 11, 2018 December 11, 2018 Anthony Gockowski	
The We the People Convention, an Ohio-based Tea Party affiliate, announced Monday that it took out a full-page ad demanding funding of the border wall in The Washington Times, which is allegedly one of the four newspapers President Donald Trump reads every morning.
In a Monday press release, We the People Convention President Tom Zawistowski wrote to his supporters to explain why he “spent the time and the thousands of dollars necessary to run” the full-page ad.
Zawistowski expresses concern about “the disconnect between President Trump and the grassroots,” saying the grassroots has “virtually no communications” with Trump.
“I felt that we needed to get the message to the president that we never expected him to do this alone,” he writes. “My understanding is that the president reads four newspapers each day and one of them is The Washington Times. Further, The Washington Times delivers the paper to every congressional office.”
“I am confident that the president will get our message and hopeful that he will reconsider his positions and reach out to us so that we can coordinate our efforts for 2020,” Zawistowski continues, noting that “the other side is playing for keeps.”
“Their goal is to end this in 2020 or before. If they succeed, we will never have this chance again to restore our nation. It’s just that simple,” he adds.
Zawistowski goes on to explain that the advertisement will provide Trump some leverage as he prepares to meet with Democratic leaders Tuesday and Republican leadership later in the week.
“Our letter shows that we are engaged and that we want the full $25 billion. That should give Trump some negotiating leverage,” he says, telling his fellow Ohioans that “we are going to have to do things we may not want to do and have not done before to protect our president.”
The advertisement itself is written directly to Trump in an effort to encourage the president, telling him that it “is impossible for you, Mr. President, to defeat the ‘deep state'” and its allies without “We the People providing the backing you need to get things done.”
“The immediate battle that must be won is the funding of the border wall. You ran on the promise to build the wall. Every ‘Republican’ in the House and Senate has run on the promise that they would vote to ‘build the wall,'” the ad states. “We the People voted for you and all of them because we understand that we must build a wall on the southern border, and we must fix our intentionally broken immigration laws, if we are to remain a sovereign nation.”
We the People Convention’s advertisement also applauds Trump for “rightfully” threatening to shut down the government if the $5 billion in funding for the border wall isn’t included in the budget bill.
“We the People do not think this is negotiable. We want the entire wall funded! Now!” the ad continues. “Therefore, we ask you and Congress to keep your promises and authorize the full $25 billion in border wall funding in this budget bill.”

Great job Tom…Every American should applaud Tom for taking this action. This is a well thought out, and very much needed strategy, and we ALL need to support it. If we set on our hands, and not support this folks we have no one to blame but ourselves for what comes.

Deindustrialization and Employment in Morocco
A new OCP Policy Center policy brief shows that “downward trend of employment in manufacturing in Morocco is due primarily to labor productivity improvement and that the increased deficit in manufacturing trade also plays an important role. While recognizing the crucial importance of a vibrant manufacturing sector in Morocco, this brief argues that Morocco cannot rely primarily on manufactures to “pull” labor out of agriculture. To provide more jobs, Moroccan policies should pay more attention to sectors which employ large numbers of people and where employment is expanding as a result of the ongoing structural transformation of the Moroccan economy.”

“The Game (of Genre) is Afoot, or Will Ferrell ‘a-starting’”
In my course on academic film criticism, I critique popular reviewing as a “say nothing” enterprise; the practice often reduces to “the film was good [or bad].” The problem with such evaluative criticism is that without a methodology for determining what good or bad might mean, the project is doomed to failure.
Coupled with this, most popular film reviewers engage in a kind of group-think. If you sample a set of reviews, you will discover the forwarding of very few innovative ideas about the movies under scrutiny, and a great deal of repetition of banalities.
Of the many lamentable things about Internet culture, the new algorithms that determine our modes of thinking reinforce the stripping away of nuance and disagreement. Review aggregators use these cookie-cutter reviews as suspect data to further reduce the complexity of how and why we might talk about films.
For example, the Internet Movie Database reports on a film’s “metascore.” Like Rotten Tomatoes, another such summary mechanism, the metascore amalgamates parroted reviews, producing a self-fulfilling prophesy: at the center of a bell curve of taste, the aggregate sense of whether a film is worth seeing or not snowballs in one direction or another.
As of January 2, 2019, the lowest metascore for a film at my local movie theater is a 24 for Holmes and Watson, designated in a warning color, red. In a pique of sheer insanity, the nth version of Transformers, Bumblebee has a metascore of 67, given the green light by a consensus culture that has lost its collective mind.
The reviews of Holmes and Watson are blisteringly negative. One example will suffice, because it stands in for any number of other reviews I could quote: On IndieWire, David Erlich writes that the film “supplies fewer laughs in its entirety than Step Brothers does in its deleted scenes.” He continues, “The only compelling mystery about Holmes and Watson is how so many funny people have been squeezed into such an unfunny movie, a movie that isn’t nearly smart enough to recognize how stupid it should have been.” The criticism is built on a crucial assumption about genre that I would like to explore: Erlich assumes that Holmes and Watson is a comedy. The last time I checked, there was not a stone tablet commanding this to be so.
I agree that, by and large, the film is not all that funny, although I would observe that the dozen or so people in the movie theater I saw the film with laughed a fair amount, as did I, far more often than the death knell of comedy criticism: “the only funny parts in the film were already in the trailer.” It’s also worth noting that the funniest films of the past fifty years were panned by critics: Airplane!, Caddyshack, The Blues Brothers. We might have good reasons to distrust popular film critics when it comes to predicting what we will treasure as funny decades from now.
We need an expansive criticism, not a reductive one. Why do people go to see Will Ferrell movies? How do they work? Why do they work? Good criticism offers a new insight into some potential answers to such questions. Like Derridean linguistic deferral, there is not a universal formula somewhere that allows us to wash our hands of a film with the slathering of a red 24 next to the film’s title.
What if Holmes and Watson is not a comedy at all, but a Sherlock Holmes film?
The experience can still make us laugh: Holmes tries to swat a poisonous insect off of Watson’s head, eventually hitting him with a large cricket bat, in the process smashing open a case of killer bees. Holmes tries to contain the far nastier insect threat than initiated the sequence of comic events, placing a diving helmet on Watson’s head.
No one would accuse Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941) of not being funny enough. Yet, it is a funny film: “I think it would be fun to run a newspaper,” an exasperated Thatcher says about his ne’er-do-well charge, Charles Foster Kane, who is losing copious amounts of money attempting to make the world a better place using the bully pulpit of the press.
More to the point, in the endless recyclings of the Sherlock Holmes mythology, plenty of funny things happen. In one of the Basil Rathbone films, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Arthur Werker, 1939), the consulting detective plucks pizzicato at his violin, attempting to find the right pitch to get the flies in the room to assemble in a glass on the table before him. Indeed, this scene is not only deconstructed in Holmes and Watson, but was already lovingly reconstructed in Guy Ritchie’s film, Sherlock Holmes (2009), starring Robert Downey Jr. as the sleuth.
Holmes and Watson parodies the Guy Ritchie film’s best contribution to the cinematic representation of Sherlock Holmes: as the detective is about engage in a fight with an enemy, Robert Downey Jr.’s character quickly calculates the physics of all that he is about to do in order to defeat his opponent by the end of the encounter. Will Ferrell’s Holmes, of course, bungles this method repeatedly; John C. Reilly’s Watson fares even worse.
When a character like Sherlock Holmes has ascended to mythological status, new films by necessity press him into axiomatically more interesting situations. The much beloved Steven Moffat BBC series, Sherlock (2010-present) and the recently cancelled Elementary (CBS, 2012-2018) are built around such an intertextual premise. Only the most moribund theoretical position that insists on fidelity to the source text would find these two shows anything other than refreshing.
By this standard, Holmes and Watson is as delightful as any of these other versions of Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock is a devilishly complex show, but Will Ferrell can do funnier things with his face and body than can the Shakespearean Benedict Cumberbatch. Those of us who love the detective, in whatever form, are desperate to see more of him, now that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is long since incapable of supplying us with new, so-called authentic stories of his most famous hero’s exploits. Give me Sherlock Holmes, and I am happy; it matters less how I am served the dish than the fact that it is enjoyable to eat.
All criticism needs to do is forward a new understanding of how and why Holmes and Watson presses the mythology of Sherlock Holmes in a new direction. It need not be a positive direction: good criticism can also question whether more harm than good has been done to the world via its introduction. Indeed, a large swath of academic film criticism is devoted to fretting about the race, class, and gender politics of particularly offensive Hollywood cinema.
However, in the case of Holmes and Watson, I think something quite productive is engaged. At the film’s conclusion, Holmes and Watson say goodbye to the women with whom they’ve fallen in love. Watson’s infatuations are split between, absurdly, Queen Victoria, and Grace Hart, with whom the doctor conducts an autopsy to track down the mastermind behind a plot to assassinate the queen. Meanwhile, Holmes vomits the whole time, unable to stand the gore associated with this aspect of detective work. It’s refreshing to see an obnoxious hero like Sherlock Holmes handed his just desserts now and again.
In one of the film’s most aggressive maneuvers, which will surely drive earnest Sherlock Holmes fans to distraction, the detective falls in love with Millie, whom Grace claims to have raised in a feral state as a science experiment. Here, we are far from Irene Adler, the only woman on the planet apparently smarter than Holmes in Conan Doyle’s sexist imagination. He indeed, obnoxiously strips her of her very name, calling her instead merely, “the woman.” Ferrell portrays Holmes in the presence of Millie as a jittery schoolboy smitten. Jeremy Brett is surely turning over in his grave. But luckily for us, we can’t hear him doing so.
In the third act, the film jumps narrative rails, locating its setting as April 1912, oddly eleven years after the death of Queen Victoria. Holmes thanks Watson for his help in solving the case. In another assault on the Sherlock Holmes canon, the beloved Mrs. Hudson from the Basil Rathbone films and the Benedict Cumberbatch television show turns out to be the villain, and evil Professor Moriarty’s daughter to boot. With Watson’s help, Holmes discovers the location of the bomb, throwing it off of the Titanic, killing the housekeeper turned villain in her life boat.
This is a turning point in the relationship between Holmes and Watson. In this version of the tale, Holmes steals all of the credit for their work together, refusing to grant Watson his wish to be labeled a co-detective at 221B Baker Street. However, after the Titanic caper is solved, Holmes sees the light and lavishes praise on his sidekick, publicly announcing that Watson’s name should forever more be associated with the greatness of the Titanic. So much for well-meaning beneficence.
Chaotic buffoonery wins the day, as a decade-since dead queen is saved along with an ocean liner that is about to become the greatest tragedy at sea in human history. In 2018, we Americans should understand something about such political buffoonery. Part of a series of jokes in Holmes and Watson, including a moment when the detective seeks out proper headwear, not having discovered the deerstalker signature. One of the candidates is a red MEGA hat: “Make England Great Again.”
As Holmes says goodbye to Millie as she is about to board the Titanic, she reveals that she was only pretending to be uneducated, allowing herself to conduct a sociological experiment of her own. Holmes attempts to one up her, claiming that he knew of her ruse all along, but of course he has clearly been bested by the gender ideology of 2018, which has long since discarded the mores of the early 20th century. Holmes and Watson is no better, nor worse, than the other contemporary Holmes stories, which all find ways of constructing three dimensional female characters who are not named Irene Adler.
In short, for someone like me who just likes to watch movies, particularly ones featuring Sherlock Holmes, a beloved figure in my life, largely because of my long since passed father’s infatuation with him, Holmes and Watson delivers plenty of engaging circumstances, and even thematic material on which to ponder.
Even for the purists who have surely abandoned my line of reasoning, the film turns back toward the source texts in unexpected ways. Indeed, the foundational Sherlock Holmes story by Arthur Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet (1887) is set in Salt Lake City in 1847. While Holmes, Watson and Moriarty never step foot in the United States, Basil Rathbone did go to Washington, D.C. during World War II, desperate for our powerful nation to aid in the rescuing of Britain from the Nazis.
In no more improbable an occurrence, the final shot of Holmes and Watson finds the co-detectives having traveled to the American West, presumably having either survived or skirted the sinking of the Titanic. They have tracked Moriarty, in a wildly optimistic gambit for a sequel, Holmes and Watson: Together Again, perhaps hoping for a soaring metascore of 25. Long live the queen; long live popular film criticism.

Pasta Friday Gets Communities Cooking Pasta Together
Pasta Friday Gets Communities Cooking Pasta Together
Allison Arevalo, a co-founder of Homeroom who sold her interest in 2017, offers tips for Pasta Friday gatherings of your own.

Allison Arevalo has lived in Oakland for only 10 years, but in that time she has made an indelible mark on the culinary scene. Homeroom, the iconic mac-and-cheese restaurant she co-founded in 2011 with Erin Wade, spawned a best-selling cookbook and awakened a national interest in updating beloved childhood favorites for an adult audience hungry for nostalgia and comfort food.
It was this return to the comforts of childhood that inspired Arevalo to begin Pasta Friday, a project she undertook after selling her stake in Homeroom in 2017. Pasta Friday is a simple concept: Every week for one year Arevalo will cook a new type of pasta with sauce, pair it with a hearty salad, and host as many friends as are available. The idea grew out of a desire to reconnect with friends after years spent raising children and running a successful business. It was also a way for Arevalo to reconnect to her own past. Arevalo’s grandmother left Italy for the United States when she was 16 and always hosted large pasta dinners for the family every Sunday. The first Pasta Friday was held a week after she passed away, and the menu for that night was cavatelli with pork neck ragu — Arevalo’s grandmother’s favorite dish.
Pasta Friday was an instant success: Within two months the email list had grown to 90 people. Guests came seeking good food, good conversation, and a connection. New friendships were born, and Arevalo’s community expanded as though her friends and neighbors had been waiting for an excuse to come together.
Soon Arevalo found herself cooking for 75 people including more than two dozen children. While she has since trimmed her email list and now caps RSVPs at about 50, she learned a lot about hosting large groups and is thrilled that other people are starting their own Pasta Friday traditions based on her model. Think you might be interested in hosting your own weekly dinner and connecting with friends? Arevalo shares these tips:
Keep it simple: Arevalo prepares a large pot of pasta, sauce, and a hearty salad. No appetizers, no desserts (other than Popsicles for the kids), and guests bring their own wine (she recommends one bottle per guest — it’s Friday night, after all.)
Feed the kids first: Hungry kids are no fun, so prepare their food first, feed them, and then reward them with a movie in a quiet room. This lets the grown-ups relax and enjoy their meal rather than being interrupted a hundred times for more parmesan.
Use compostable plates and forks: Who wants to end a great party by washing dishes for three hours?
Set an end time: Having guests leave at a reasonable hour means you can clean up and get into bed before the roosters come out.
Don’t stress about your house: Your guests are coming to see you, not inspect your corners for dust bunnies. Arevalo says it’s important to clean the bathroom (and stock it with extra toilet paper) as well as the kitchen — she washes her prep dishes and pots and pans 15 minutes before guests arrive. And don’t pressure yourself to get food on the table beforehand. No one expects to eat the minute he or she walks in the door.
Communicate: Arevalo uses a Facebook group to coordinate who will bring Popsicles for the kids, baguettes for the adults, and to ask for last-minute items. People are always happy to help.
Start small: Try having one or two families the first time around and see how nice it is to finish the week by having friends for dinner. Arevalo says people will be surprised how easy it is — and how eager their friends are to come.
Arevalo plans to create a Pasta Friday cookbook with recipes and entertaining tips. She also has a food truck in the works where she’ll create fresh pasta on demand. If her previous endeavors are any indication, these upcoming projects are sure to be successes.

Woman Confesses To Her Boyfriend That She Was Raped - Situation Takes A Deadly Turn
By: Clayton Browne | January 13, 2017

A man in Minnesota is facing murder charges for attacking and decapitating a man he believed had sexually assaulted his girlfriend.
Police allege Joseph Christen Thoresen attacked David Haiman with a baseball bat, stabbed him several times, then cut his head off. At that point, Thoresen apparently dragged Haiman's torso and his head further back in the wooded area.
Apparently, 20-year-old Haiman was reported missing when he didn’t report to work and hadn't been seen for five days. Haiman’s body and head were found a few days later on a wooded rural farm.
The girlfriend explained to police that when she heard Haiman was on his way over, she told Thoresen that Haiman had sexually assaulted her just a few days before.
The police report claims when Haiman walked in, the couple restrained him with tape and the woman punched him, breaking his nose. Thoresen punched the victim several times and told him that he should not have raped "my girl.”
The three of them left in Haiman's car and drove to a rural area "smoke some bud." The girlfriend notes they also stopped by a local club and smoked some crystal meth.
After that they drove out into the country a ways. Then the car overheated and Thoresen and Haiman started to argue. The girlfriend said that Thoresen then asked Haiman to check the oil, and when he was bent over the engine, Thoresen smashed him in the head with a baseball bat and stabbed him at least twice.
The girlfriend says she made a couple of efforts to stop Thoresen, but the crazed man grabbed a large knife from Haiman's belt, and sawed off the unconscious Haiman's head before tossing it deeper back into the woods.

Time to Hire? Consider the Pros and Costs
It's exciting to discover an opportunity to expand the size or scope of your business, and sometimes more workers are needed to make that happen. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 32% of small-business owners said they intend to increase the number of jobs in their companies over the next 12 months.1
How do you know if your business is really ready to take on new employees? Start by estimating the potential revenue and profit gains, in light of the additional costs.
Help Wanted?
Here are a few more signs that it may be time to hire.
Customer demand for your company's goods or services is steadily increasing. It may take some time to confirm that growth is consistent and not a seasonal or temporary surge.
You (and/or your staff) can no longer handle critical work in a timely manner, and customer service is suffering.
You regularly pay current employees a significant amount of overtime.
You would like to act on attractive growth opportunities, such as opening a new location.
One or more people with a particular skill set are needed to help develop a new product or add to your menu of services.
Run the Numbers
A new employee's salary can be substantial by itself, but Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes add to the employer's total costs, as do legal requirements such as workers' compensation insurance. For example, U.S. employer costs averaged $35.28 per hour worked in June 2017, with $24.10 going to wages and $11.18 for benefits.2 Of course, an employer's actual costs will vary widely by industry, region, and the type of position.
Small businesses may not offer workplace benefits (such as health insurance and retirement plans) commonly provided by large companies. Even so, offering a more generous benefit package might be helpful for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, a task that has become more difficult in competitive job markets.
There may be additional expenses associated with screening applicants, training new workers, and complying with various federal and state regulations, some of which may be specific to your industry. In fact, you might consult an accountant to help determine whether you can afford to hire extra help.

Money Saving Tips – 5 Easy Ways to Pay Less Tax
You are here: Home / Money Tips / Money Saving Tips – 5 Easy Ways to Pay Less Tax
5 Easy Ways to Pay Less Tax
We asked our top accountants for the 10 easiest ways that you can pay less tax to the government and keep more of the money you earn. They had a lot of answers. (And they are all legal!)
The simple tips on this page will help ensure you pay less tax in the coming year
Here’s the first part of our two-part article that could help you save big $$$ in the upcoming tax season.
1. Keep Good Tax Records (with the right method, it is very easy)
Tax deduction claims need to be paired with receipts that you can show to the ATO. Keeping track of those receipts is the law, but it’s also the best way for you to remember everything that you can claim later on.
Keeping good records is the #1 way to make sure you claim every expense you are entitled to (and help ensure your tax process runs smoothly). Get organised—it’s easy!
Record-keeping shouldn’t be a headache for you. Just take 5 minutes each week to put your receipts into a folder (or save them online) and update your logbooks. We guarantee it will save a lot of pain and anguish at the end of financial year—and it’ll help you pay less tax!
Here are two simple tools that make it easy to save and claim your tax-deductible receipts:
How to organise your tax receipts and boost your tax refund
The Etax mobile app makes it easy to save receipts, using your mobile phone camera.
2. Be Charitable
Did you know that every donation over $2 you make to a registered charity is tax deductible? After you make any donation you should be given a receipt. At tax time, add up the donation receipts and you can claim it as a tax deduction for the preceding financial year. Basically, some of the money you donate to good causes enables you to pay less tax.
Remember: Keep your receipts in a folder. Later, when you’re ready to do your tax return, you’ll be able to find them and claim some extra deductions that will help you pay less tax.
Another thing about donations we should clear up: Your donations don’t come straight back onto your tax refund. They are subtracted from your taxable income, which means you get a percentage back (depending on your income and taxation rate).
3. Claim what you are entitled to claim
Claiming work-related expenses like transportation is a very good way to increase your tax refund and pay less tax.
Claiming deductions is one of the best tools in reducing your overall tax payable. If you have to spend money during the year and it relates to earning your income, then keep the receipt and make sure you claim a deduction for what you are entitled to. Even if you use the item for part work and part personal, you can still to claim an apportioned deduction.
If you are not sure whether you can claim a particular item, keep the receipt and ask us later, when you prepare your next tax return. It is better to keep a receipt and not claim it, than to throw it out and find out you could have included it on your return!
4. Seek the Advice of Tax Professionals
In most cases using a tax agent or accountant can not only save you a lot of time, but will also improve your tax refund or net payable. This is why the ATO’s statistics show 70% of Australians use a tax agent’s service – like Etax.com.au!
At Etax we are experts in tax and we have up-to-date and in-depth knowledge of tax laws and changes. We may find you are entitled to deductions you were unaware of or even an offset you didn’t know existed. Quite often our people spot and correct little mistakes that could slow down a taxpayer’s refund or, worse, that could cause an ATO reassessment or audit later on. And the best part is; the cost of the Etax online return is very low and can be claimed as a deduction on next year’s tax return.
A tax agent’s job is to help you steer clear of ATO problems and to help you pay less tax.
5. Medicare Levy Surcharge
If you do not hold a private insurance policy, as soon as your income exceeds $90 000 for singles or $180 000 for families, you will be required to pay a minimum of 1% extra in the form of the Medicare Levy Surcharge. This is on top of the compulsory 2.0% Medicare levy paid by most Australian taxpayers.
Often the cost of taking out private health insurance will cost less than the 1% of your gross income you will be required to pay when completing your tax return.

Economic freedom declines in the U.S.
In the annual compendium, Economic Freedom of the World, Canada's Fraser Institute shows that the United States has dropped in its economic freedom ranking from no. 2 to no. 8 between 2000 and 2008. The only countries that worsened more during the same period are Zimbabwe, Argentina, Niger, Venezuela, and Guyana.
Star Parker, from the Coalition on Urban Renewal and Education wrote:
"It stands to reason that if all it takes is a smooth talking politician to expropriate the property of individuals or businesses, that the ability and willingness to work, save, invest and do business will suffer. And that prosperity will decline.
"Barack Obama is running for president to save us from ourselves and give politicians even more sway over our private lives and property. He's telling us that it's 'Wall Street CEOs whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess.'
"But Obama sat by in silence as the Senate tried to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2005. And he's taken $126,349 in contributions from Fannie and Freddie, second highest in the Senate (only behind Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd)."
Continue reading Star Parker's article Protect us, don't expropriate us.

An Introduction to Cenocracy
Introduction to Cenocracy
http://cenocracy.org
"Cenocracy" means New Government. (Ceno = New, Cracy = Government)... though the application specifically to Democracy as "Ceno-Democracy" is acceptable by some, and "Cenocracy" has an application beyond democracy to whatever government may be formed in the centuries ahead.
A Nation that does not respect the Collective Will of its sovereign people, and in fact operates with policies (such as for example, the Electoral College, Gerrymandering, no term limits, campaign costs, entitlement provisions, etc...) that are intended to undermine the Collective Will so that the people are deliberately kept from being able to exercise its Collective wisdom, foresight and intelligence based on a Collective experience; is a Nation that cannot itself be respected, and the people must... without equivocation or vacillation, begin the unenviable process of predisposing their consciousness to the occupation of collectively fomenting the decision to bring about a New Government which suits them better. For we are on a forced path of Revolution to establish a Cenocracy!
We are pursuing an effort to interest others in establishing an Actual Democracy. What we mean by an "actual democracy" is defined as:
Literally, rule by the people. The term is derived from the Greek de-mokratia-, which was coined from de-mos (“people”) and kratos (“rule”) in the middle of the 5th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens.
Source: "Democracy." Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, 2013.
This "Rule of or by the People" entails the adoption of a government design which provides for a "Peoples Legislative Branch" as part of the current 3-branches "Checks and Balances" formula which far too often acts as a Trust (consortium), that is at odds with the best interests of the public over the interests of a select few... such as those involved in the military-industrial complex whose activities effect multiple ulterior motives at the expense of one public or another. There is no constitutionally mandated anti-trust provision against the current three branches of government which can be effected by the public except by way of engaging in activity which uses a force of arms.
Let's talk seriously about peace page 23
The idea of "Rule by the People" is generally viewed as being synonymous with Abraham Lincoln's phrase used in his Gettysburg address: A government of the people, by the people, for the people... shall not perish from the Earth. However, this phrase must be placed into the context of its history:
John Wycliffe, (1384): "The Bible is for the Government of the People, by the People, and for the People".
Theodore Parker, (1858): "Democracy is direct self-government, over all the people, by all the people, for all the people."
Abraham Lincoln, (1863): ..."and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
Even though he is said to have gotten the phrase from reading ideas written by the Abolitionist Preacher Theodore Parker (who actually used the word "all" when referring to the people), the idea that Americans have a unique brand of Democracy that "will not perish from the Earth"... is actually false when we look beyond the curtain of politics and survey the reality of the geo-planetary landscape which recognizes three on-going deteriorations that humanity does not have the technology nor know-how to correct.
The Sun's energy is waning and is said to be on a course of expansion which will engulf the innermost three planets.
The rotation rate of the Earth is slowing. (Changes in the geo-magnetic dynamo, winds, and waves are affected as well as daytime-based circadian rhythms). Humans may well be Are Humans Rotation Rate Specific?
The Moon is receding, causing changes in tidal behavior and lunar-based circadian rhythms.
In fact there are very many differently styled phony practices of democracy being exhibited throughout the world. For example, the 2016 U.S. Presidential election in which the majority of voters chose Hillary Clinton— only to have their opinion undermined by a non-democratic political practice called the "Electoral College" which elected her opponent Donald Trump (even before all the votes were counted!), is a slap in the face, punch in the stomach, and kick in the shins to all those who think America practices some sort of government which epitomizes what a democracy is. And yet, the public is not yet hit hard enough to wake them from their illusion which has so inebriated them that they actually live out their lives in a delusion. Hence, some refer to American Democracy as a DeMockery of its actual meaning.
Needless to say, the United States does not practice an Actual Democracy. As noted by many observers, it is not a democracy but is variously referred to as a:
Corporatocracy- (government run by corporations, or those primarily involved in economic interests by way of Trusts and Monopolies like the "Military-Industrial" association with members that want to create situations providing an excuse to get more funding, build up inventories, and practice their individualized wares.)
Oligarchy- (government by the few, especially despotic power exercised by a small and privileged group for corrupt or selfish purposes... {Britannica citation}
Plutocratic-Aristocracy- (government by the wealthy whose economic interests play out like children's games in which different people amongst their wealth and political power ilk "take turns" at leadership, effectively producing a moving target that the public has difficulty in rallying against like those in the past who had a singular non-mobile class of individuals to focus on.)
While some readers may prefer to define the U.S. government (and others) with different terms, the three examples will suffice in highlighting the perspective that many of us do not recognize the U.S. government as a Democracy. And with respect to Abraham Lincoln's comment that such a government (assumed as a democracy) will not perish from the Earth... it is a true statement when one considers the fact that such a government "of, by, for the people" doesn't actually exist. Something that doesn't exist in the first place can not possibly vanish. True to its initial design in the 1700s, America was never set up to be a democracy, never set up to let the people control their government and in fact were meant to be cheerleaders, cannon fodder and supporters... without having much say in anything except to comply with the collective Will of a few.
However, it is of need to refresh the memories of the those who are inclined to think that the type of government the U.S. has is a "Republic" and this is to be designated a "Democracy" because it is a formula derived as a "Representative" government whose leaders are chosen by a vote taken amongst the citizens; but in actuality is a convoluted expression of democracy because the Will of the people are not permitted to actually decide on their leadership as denoted by the laughable exercises of an "electoral college" and "gerrymandering"; which permit the voting process to be controlled to serve or preserve a special interest group; be it called a Republican, Democratic or Independent party... or otherwise. There are three falsehoods with respect to interpreting a "Republic" as a democracy, because:
The people are often forced to choose amongst the lesser of evils, or those who are "keepers of the flame" and are not "path finders" with the best interests of the public in mind... though many of them actually think that have some sort of mandate to decide what the people want and need simply because of their position.
Those who are elected (by way of a convoluted voting process) do not represent the Will of the people, because the Will of the people on every single issue is not called upon for an assessment.
The voting system (election processes) can be, and frequently are rigged.
Hence, a "Republic" form of so-called democracy can not be respected and therefore can not be sustained as a viable form of government because it promotes socially-disabling forms of governance inimical to the highest values of equality, liberty/freedom and justice.
In a discussion about democracy and its origin centuries ago, it is of value to review a bit of history so that the reader may fully appreciate those of us at Cenocracy.org are not making wild claims or basing our judgment on falsifications of details for which there is little documented evidence of. Nonetheless, we will admit that different interpretations of the same material sometimes arises in discussions, but that eventually, some overall consensus is achieved.
Monarchy, oligarchy, democracy
No Athenian believed that he had anything to learn from the bureaucratic monarchies of the East, which were incompatible with Greek notions of citizenship. If self-defense necessitated that every citizen be required to fight for his polis when called on, in return each had to be conceded some measure of respect and autonomous-personal freedom. To protect that freedom, government was necessary: anarchy had no attractions for any Greek except perhaps Diogenes, the father of Cynic philosophy.
The central question of politics, then, was the distribution of power among the citizens. Was Greek freedom best preserved and defined by the rule of the few or by that of the many? On the whole, the great names favoured aristocracy—the rule of the best. Plato believed that the object of politics was virtue, and that only a few would ever thoroughly understand the science by which virtue could be attained and that those trained few should rule. Aristotle, his pupil, seems to have put the cultivation of the intellect highest among human goods, and he believed—quite reasonably, given the limited economic resources then available—that this fruit of civilization could be gathered only among a leisure class supported by the labours of the many. In return for their leisure, the gentry should agree to sacrifice some of their time to the tedious business of governing, which only they would be sufficiently disinterested and well-informed to do successfully. Neither of these apologies for oligarchy had any success in practice. The champions of democracy carried the day, at least in Athens and its allied cities. In return for playing their parts as soldiers or sailors, ordinary Athenians insisted on controlling the government.
The result was imperfect but impressive. The people were misled by demagogues; they were intolerant enough to put Plato's master, Socrates, to death; they were envious of all personal distinction; and of their three great wars (against Persia, Sparta, and Macedonia), they lost two. Furthermore, passionate devotion to the idea that Athens was the greatest of all cities, the school of Greece and the wonder of civilization, misled them into basing their society in large part on slave labour, into wanton imperial adventure abroad, and into denying Athenian citizenship to all who were not born into it (even Aristotle), however much they contributed to the city's greatness and however much more they might have done. The foundations of Athenian democracy were narrow, shallow, and fragile. But to say all this is only to say that the city could not entirely shake off the traditions of its past. Its achievement was the more remarkable for that. Seldom since has civilized humanity surpassed democratic Athens, and until the last the city was satisfactorily governed by law and by popular decision. It owed its fall less to any flaw than to the overwhelming force that was mounted against it.
For to the north of Hellas proper, a new power arose. Greek civilization had slowly trained and tamed the wild men of Macedonia. Their king, Philip II, forged them into a powerful army; he and his son Alexander the Great then seized the opportunity open to them. History and geography made it impossible for the Greek cities to hang together, so they were hanged separately. It seemed as if the city-state had been but a transient expedient. Hence-forward Athens and Sparta would take their orders from foreign conquerors—first Macedonia, then Rome.
Rome
The republic
But, as it turned out, the city-state had barely begun to display its full political potential. To the west, two non-Greek cities, Carthage and Rome, began to struggle for mastery, and after the defeat of the Carthaginian general Hannibal at Zama (202 BC), Rome emerged as the strongest state in the Mediterranean.
The Greeks did not know how to classify Rome. The Greek historian Polybius, who chronicled Rome's rise, suggested that its constitution was such a success because it was a judicious blend of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. The Romans, a conservative, practical people, showed what they thought of such abstractions by speaking only of an unanalyzed “public thing”—res publica—and thus gave a new word, republic, to politics. With this focus the patriotism of the city-state reached its greatest intensity. The Romans were deeply attached to their traditions, all of which taught the same lesson. For example, the legendary hero Gaius Mucius Scaevola gave his right hand to the flames to prove that there was nothing a Roman would not endure for his city, which therefore would never be defeated. That passionate devotion to Rome's survival was tested again and again in war. All the tales of early Rome turn on battle. With dour persistence the peasants who had gathered on the seven hills beside the river Tiber resisted every invader, fought back after every defeat, learned from all their mistakes, and even, however reluctantly and belatedly, modified their political institutions to meet the new needs of the times as they arose.
Polybius was right: power in Rome was indeed shared among the people, the aristocracy (embodied in the Senate), and the consuls—the executive officers of the republic who had replaced the kings. The claims of the many and the few were fought out at election time, when the world's first clearly identifiable political parties appeared. Until the republic's decline, the results of elections were universally respected, and the triumphant alliance of the few and the many against the world was proclaimed in the letters blazoned on the city's buildings and battle standards: “SPQR,” for Senatus populusque Romanus (“The Senate and the people of Rome”).
Like Athenian democracy, this system worked well for a long time, and if the chief Athenian legacy was the proof that politics could be understood and debated logically and that under the right conditions democracy could work, Rome proved that the political process of competition for office and the public discussion of policy were valuable things in themselves.
Nevertheless, the Roman Republic had been forged in a grim world. Wars, always supposedly in self-defense, had gradually extended Rome's power over Italy. It is not surprising that what impressed the world most about the city was its military strength rather than its political institutions, even though the two were intimately related. As the weakness of Rome's neighbours became apparent, the Romans began to believe in their mission to rule, “to spare the conquered and war down the proud,” as their greatest poet, Virgil, put it. Military strength, in short, led to military adventurism. By the 1st century BC, Rome, having become a naval power as well as a military one, had conquered the whole Mediterranean basin and much of its hinterland. The strains of empire building made themselves felt. The Roman armies, no longer composed of citizens temporarily absent from the plow or the workshop but of lifetime professionals, were now loyal to their generals rather than to the state; and those generals brought on civil war as they competed to turn their foreign conquests into power at home. The population of Rome swelled, but economic growth could not keep pace, so many citizens became paupers dependent on a public dole. The aristocrats appointed to govern the provinces saw their postings chiefly as opportunities to get rich quickly by pillaging their unfortunate subjects. The republic could not solve those and other problems and was in the end superseded by the monarchy of Augustus.

Let us note that in America, its own arrogance was revealed in such phrases as "Manifest Destiny", "Right of Imminent Domain" (used against the public), and "[Right of] Civil Asset Forfeiture" (used against the people), "Might Makes Right" and the more ancient European ideas of "Divine Right of Kings" and "Papal Infallibility". Let us also note that the foregoing "SPQR" should more rightly have been "PSQR", where the people were respected first and foremost and would not be subjected to an eventual discarding that in the present era is clearly seen in that the "people" are not even mentioned in the Presidential oath of office; but that the "Senate" remains an Honored convention and the "People" have been symbolically reduced to the word and negligibility conveyed in the phrase "House of Representatives"... thus requiring that the people reassert their rightful place by establishing a Congressional "Home of the People" by way of a "Peoples Legislative Branch".
Here is the rather pathetically worded U.S. Presidential Oath of Office:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
It is a particularly shallow oath. It's lack of depth evinces a superficial appreciation and practice of a real OF, BY, and FOR the people democracy. It mentions the Presidential office, the Constitution, and the United States. But it does not explicitly mention the people. Whereas some might want to argue the people are implied, this "implication" displaces the people into the position of an after-thought... into some vague recollection. The people should not be an implication, they are THE single most important element and should be respected by being named. The Office of the President, the Constitution, and the United States belong to the people, and not vice versa. They have a right to be personally acknowledged as the true proprietors of the United States, the Constitution, and the Presidential Office. The people are not a shadow, are not an echo, are not an entity which can not be named because of some superstitious philosophy evincing a Fairy Tale like Rumpelstiltskin and that some religious observance might ludicrously adopt as a means of suggesting its own greatness because of. The people are not that which is owned, but are in fact the owners who can and want to speak for themselves through a Cenocratic Formula of governance. The oath of the highest office in the land is that of an employee of the people and should, at the very least, recognize its boss by publicly naming them. Hard working people deserve to be recognized as being of primary importance and not be slighted by being nameless... like some shadowy figure standing in the background so as not to detract from some assumed "chosen one" intimation which distorts an underlying messianic or megalomaniac insinuation of self-importance.
We The People have a name just as we have a voice and are fated to become fully recognized as the preeminent governing Will guaranteed by a Cenocracy (New Government). All governments will be forced to accept the people as a collective identity with a viable passport to a better future. It is a Will that shall Tell the Tale of a public's arrow shot true, as a Declaration for Greater Independence! (Mentioned as a reference to William Tell who shot an arrow off of his Son's head to voice his opinion against the directive of Authority.)
At present, the people do not have a Cenocratic means of Self-Representation... it is forced to accept a vicarious form of Representation that often is out-of-touch with the actual collective Will of the People and makes guesses based on spurious polls and gut-felt assumptions.
It is a Will that is denied a full Citizenship, denied Individuality, and denied and actual right to Vote on its own behalf, without being subjected to some political machination of reigning authority.
In effect, the collective will of the people is denied its own personhood, its own incorporation and its own stock-market designation as a standard of social self-governance and not as an auxiliary component of infrequent permissibility.
The Presidential Oath describes a serious and pervasively practiced short-coming that needs to be rectified. Instead of the Presidential Office being used to preserve, protect and defend a Constitution, it should, for example, be stated thusly:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability; preserve, protect and defend the people's right to have a government which best befits their collective consciousness expressed in a collective voice through a Referendum whose results can be mandated into a law as a Constitutionized Representation of their desire for developing a better United States in partnership with a global community.”
The Presidential Office, the Constitution and the United States are nothing without the people. We need to not only begin thinking WAY outside our enclosed, segregationist boxes of tradition, but begin a practice thereof by altering the wording of oaths, pledges, and declarations to be reflected in our laws and social practices. If the public is to grow up as an expressed governing self of maturity, then the government should practice such a maturity as a preeminent role model. Let it lead with the leadership of a true leader.
If grocery stores and other businesses can display a respectful acknowledgment and humility towards senior citizens, handicapped persons and pregnant women by providing particularlized parking spaces as an oath of a stated business practice; at the very least the President of the United States can exhibit a respectful acknowledgment of all the Nations' peoples by providing a particularlized comment thereof and there-for... if for nothing else, than to thank the public for the privilege of being able to serve it. Whereas the Person elected to the Presidency is named a President, and those elected to Congress are at least referred to as Members of Congress, the people are unduly slighted when they are not as such individually acknowledged in the Oath taken by the President. In fact, all government oaths should be provisioned with a recognition of the people. This is an oversight that needs to be remedied.
For example, here is the Presidential oath refashioned to individually include the people that, for the most part, uses the same formula but that may not raise the eyebrows of some traditionalists, even though it will have a great impact on the perception and practice of politics and governance:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Citizens of the United States.”
While some may prefer to use the word "Citizens", the usage of the word "Peoples" has merit, since many believe in the ways and means of the United States but are as yet not a citizen. Whereas, we could use the phrase "Citizens and supportive Peoples" as a useful concession to include both. In any respect, the oath must be changed to effect a greater comprehension of the present reality and not continue an expression of an antiquated mentality the people have grown out of.
And it should be fully noted that the protection and defense of the citizens very much includes a Bill -of- Rights that was initially omitted from the U.S. Constitution but were an essential inclusion in order to protect and defend the people from arbitrary acts of the Federal government, and later adopted as a necessary provision for the people against arbitrary acts of State governments. As presently practiced, the U.S. Presidential oath places the Constitution and the people in a secondary position, thus rendering a needed change as:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully preserve, protect, as well as defend the Constitution and the Bill -of- Rights of the Citizens of the United States... and will to the best of my Ability, execute the Office of President of the United States on their behalf.”
Without an alteration in the Presidential Oath, the people remain a superficial adjunct of consideration. Any lawyer who truly represents the people would not stand for such a specious oath. The people can not expect the Supreme Court to protect the Rights of the People when it is their job to protect the Rights of the Constitution... and all its short comings... The Constitution, the Bill -of- Rights, and the Presidential office mean nothing without the people. To not mention the People and their Rights is to disavow their singular and collective importance.
A new Presidential oath is needed just like the people need a new government... a Cenocracy. The future must not continue from its present footing or else more disharmony will ensue as the population increases with little change in the standard of Equality that ensures a more even redistribution and redefinition of all wealth to enhance everyone's life.
Unfortunately, over the centuries, a government by way of an Aristocracy showed itself to be less than the "best" of all citizens. (Nor were they able to exhibit what Plato argued in the Republic: the best government would be led by a minority of the most highly qualified persons— an aristocracy of “philosopher-kings”... Britannica citation from "Democracy" article.) They were (and are) often less intelligent, less compassionate, less wise, less generous, less insightful and (sometimes) generally exhibit opposite characteristics which have created needless privations and abuses amongst various populations. The same is true today because those who obtain a leadership position are those who have learned to play one sort of political game over another, supported by a governing system that is enabled to undermine the collective Will of the people... as is the interminable case in the U.S. and U.K... and many other places as well.
No less, if we were to permit members of the military to be the governing leadership of the Nation, the people would find themselves in the midst of an organization which is run like a Socialist-Communism that conceals its existence as a welfare program because it is not self-sufficient and must be continually supported by taxes. In fact, a short list of the military way of life clearly exhibits its non-democratic nature:
While there are various arguments against the notion of the military as a Socialism, Communism, welfare program (to which we could add businesses and religions because of tax subsidies and bail-outs, the most prominent one appears to be the reliance of an opinion that the practice of a Socialism (or welfare, or Communism) is that such descriptions involve a type of specific economic practice. In other words, the Military is not organized as a traditionally branded Socialist or Communist form of economic system (as opposed to a Capitalist-Democracy), and therefore is not and can not be a Socialist or Communist (or welfare) practice. Such a logic is like describing someone having to be in love because the are loving, and if they are not in love they therefore can not be loving. The argumentation being used to refute the claims that the military is the practice of a Socialist-Communist (welfare) system are just as convoluted as those which claim the U.S. epitomizes the practice of Democracy and therefore means not only the nation is great, but because of an assumed virtue, has to be and must be great... where as in actuality, the social structure is imploding and exhibits parallels to the beginning stages of ancient Rome's demise.
Let it be plainly noted that our description of the Military as a taxes-paid-for practice of a Socialistically-Communistic welfare model is in pointing out the Humanitarian Aspects of Socialism and not its economic dynamics which needs to go through a serious reassessment based on the knowledge we have today regarding the evolved globally inter-dependent social realities. The dichotomy which arises between an idea of basic Socialist economic practice labeled "State ownership of the means of production" and the idea of a basic Capitalist economic practice labeled "private ownership of the means of production"... overlooks the fact that so-called private ownership commonly involves the situation in which actual ownership is more on the order of a long-term leasing program (due to required fees, taxes, insurance, etc...); which makes the assumed "private ownership" as much an illusion as is the practice of democracy.
A person "owns" a car, a house, a business, etc., so long as they continue paying registration fees, license renewal fees, house payments, insurance, utilities, taxes, filing fees, etc..., or else they can very well be forbidden to drive "their" paid-for vehicle on the road, face fore-closure on "their" house, lose "their" business, etc... In other words, the STATE already owns many of the presumed "privately owned" items a person has. In other words, most people are on a long-term lease program... including a person's so-called "privately owned" land which can be confiscated by the STATE under a provision called "right of eminent domain for public use"... In other words, Capitalism is a system of opportunism for the STATE to take whatever it wants whenever it wants, so long as there is a law entitling it to do so. And where no law exists a few can get together and draft a law and the people are not enabled to stop it. Far too many arguments for or against either Socialism or Capitalism are the result of narrowly defined criteria so that compliance with an observed rationale has to jump through a specific set of arbitrarily placed artificial hoops... typically subjected to a time-constraint.
Yet, in citing comparisons between the military, welfare, socialism and Communism, it must be emphasized that no disparagement is intended. It is merely an effort to establish a greater level of perceptual truth so that we are not burdened by the wares of illusion which suspend social development because it is preoccupied with living in the realm of an accepted delusion that We The People need to wake up from and not create a functionality of dependence on various forms of contrived distractions which act as different types of drunkenness which cause us to embrace personalized forms of fairytale narratives. It goes without saying that most of those who perform military service do so honorably, yet this is not to say that all those receiving honorable discharges served honorably or those that did not receive an honorable discharge actually served dishonorably... because military superiors can and do make faulty judgments.
As part of our "program" to promote the idea for needing a New Government (a Cenocracy), we assert the need for establishing a "Peoples Legislative Branch" in Congress to participated as a fully-fledged Checks-and-Balances provision to ensure that the Will of the people will become the law of the land. The "PLB" will be made of one man, one woman, and one worker... randomly chosen from a list of self-elected citizens whose wish to be placed on the to-be-chosen-from-list of candidates. The process by which such individual citizens are chosen and their full Congressional duties can be worked out. Respectively, the "PLB" can call for the public to provide a reassessment of any and all laws, including the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and change it according to the collective will if so desired.
The need for establishing an Actual or fully-fledged democracy is to enable the whole of the public to practice making collective decisions which will eventually entail what sort of government is best for the Nation and humanity the whole. In other words, the establishment of creating an Actual Democracy will be a step forward in our historical direction instead of wallowing in the mud as we presently are.
If we want to step forward into a New Dawn, a New Age, a New Awakening of Consciousness, we must accept the responsibility of foraging ahead past the foliage of the present governing jungle being falsely claimed as a democracy. It is an expedition into the unknown because the Actual Democracy to which we speak of has never been tried on the scale of a global population which exists today, and is marked for an increase in the days ahead... accompanied by diminishing resources which will need for us to have an established means of collectively dealing with the upcoming reality of increased privations, instead of reacting like an unruly dog-eat-dog mob. It is time for the entire public to stand up, be individually counted, and not accept any deviation from its right to self-rule. A place of honor that is presently subjected to business, government and religious formulas of minimization, disenfranchisement, and other forms of dismissiveness which are intended to prevent us from our rightful place as heirs to a full democracy... and not begrudgingly accept the scraps tossed to us by a select few... during a moment of their economic satiation at the expense of the public's needs.
Because the interest of these few is in fulfilling their own greed, they think to falsely impress upon us that a true practice of democracy is to permit everyone the free access to participation, except that "accessibility" and "opportunity" are words describing a labyrinthine gauntlet like a gambling casino set up to reap the lion's share of the winnings because it is a system architectured in this manner by permitting only those types of social activities (games) which ensure that the majority of people can be taken advantage of due to exceptionally high odds fixed against the public. In other words, their call for "privatization" is just another way of describing a method which permits increased instances of individualized exploitation of the public protected by the government with laws meant to serve its self-surviving interests, and let the public be damned if it doesn't like it.
For example, when seeking legal assistance to settle a dispute in small claims courts, the courts-system gains by collecting filing fees, and yet even though a person may win a judgment in their behalf, the courts washes its hands of any further involvement and expects the winner of the case to set about collecting any reimbursement; except that the loser can simply deny to acquiesce to any judgment. In other words, there is no follow-up law which forces a losing part of a court judgment to pay or provide and compensation. Thus, the government wins by virtue of collecting fees for its "assistance", but will not assist in making sure its judgment is fulfilled... because it has fulfilled its bureaucratic obligation, leaving the people to fight it out amongst themselves, thus deliberately setting the people up to create yet another possible litigation so the courts (government) can get even more money. The people can either submit to the one-side will of the government, or retaliate in a fashion which permits the government to step in and asset itself to be obeyed by collecting fines or incarcerating those who don't agree with its single-minded one-sidedness that is ludicrously called "law" and is supposed to be interpreted as some god-sanctioned righteousness. It is a double-standard of government being widely practiced. No less, if one seeks assistance through an agency such as the Better Business Bureau, it wants to "help" by collecting fees from both sides to carry out an arbitration, but again, even if one person wins, they other is under no obligation to provide any reimbursement even if they agreed to do so while in arbitration. And this is but a very small part of the hypocrisy evident in the U.S. brand of so-called democracy.
Needless to say, there are many social issues which need to be addressed but we feel can only be adequately addressed by establishing a New Government... a Cenocracy.

Recent Comments "Jim Butcher's Dresden Files: Down Town #5"
I read this long ago, but Harry Dresden is constantly trying to find the bad guys and escape from them at the same time. Strange and usual creatures attack him and his friends, but Harry doesn't falter and fights them no matter what form they may take. Lots of mayhem and sleuthing. Loved this book so much!!
By Barbara Ehrentreu | On Creative Replay
A side of Marcone we've never seen before, this is quite well done. Much like Vegeta's character progression in Dragonball Z. But I'm sure there'll be more surprises along the way as the series continues.P.S. - Props to the artists, the graphic art continues to be amazing!

Hypocrisy in Australian-Turkish chest puffing
Justin Glyn
25 March 2019
6 Comments
The stoush between Erdogan (who said New Zealanders and Australians visiting Turkey would leave it 'in coffins ') and Morrison (all options to erase this insult were 'on the table') amounts to less than meets the eye. But it speaks volumes about what a toxic brew hypocrisy and the prospect of a forthcoming election can produce.

The casual service industry is broken

David Leyonhjelm recently thanked men from South Asian backgrounds for delivering his pizza, groceries and online purchases; for rolling up their sleeves for jobs others refused. This gesture is seriously problematic. The casual service industry is broken and exploitative and needs to be carefully regulated and constantly audited.

Witnessing the sense of relief from Australian-African activists at the outcome of the Victorian state election, I was not sure why I had a sense of déjà vu. Then I realised this collective exhale reminded me vividly of the sentiment from the LGBTQ community after the marriage equality survey results were announced.

Far-right extremists are savvy political actors. They know openly discussing their beliefs risks running afoul of anti-discrimination laws. Because of this, they have mastered how to speak in the negative and convey meaning through allusion.

Oh, for a return to the Howard years

28 August 2018

We have gotten so used to a revolving door of political leaders that the prospect of a leadership challenge each time things get a little hot has become normalised. I never thought I would say this, but as an Aboriginal feminist with hard-left personal politics, last week I almost found myself viewing the Howard years in a favourable light.

Tear down Australia's racist wallpaper

Fraser Anning's speech was heavily criticised, though few who did so bear credibility. Turnbull, Dutton and Tudge can hardly be taken seriously when they invoke multiculturalism. This is how racism works: it displaces focus from material problems to imagined threats.

Media complicit in normalising fascism

For too long, the media has been complicit in maintaining the conditions which allow the likes of Cottrell and Hanson to become 'figures'. They fuel history wars, demonise migrants, target Aboriginal activists, objectify and ridicule women while ensuring at the end of the day, the Murdochs and Packers of the world still have hefty pay cheques.

Either they are flat-out wrong, unable to read crime reports or understand what the police and other agencies are telling them (which leaves in question their ability to accurately and intelligently govern), or some apparatchik in the strategy back-rooms has decided it is a good way to garner votes with a 'tough-on-crime' campaign.

Through last week's Sunday Night report on Channel 7, we were treated to another round of fear mongering. Never mind that just last year police admitted that the so-called 'Apex Gang' did not exist. As an Aboriginal woman, I'm tired of being told by politicians and newspapers which other people of colour I'm supposed to scared of.

There are two laws for how to get out of a hole: the first is to acknowledge you are in one. The second is to stop digging. I suspect Peter Dutton won't care too much for this advice. He is clearly enjoying his job, playing the populist card with great aplomb, including recently in his advocacy for white South African farmers.

Here we have a quick demonstration of a new political method. It's not designed to advance any particular policy position. The point is trolling: the simple art of using rhetoric and political acts to provoke a reaction. Suddenly a lot makes sense. Tony Abbott makes sense. Donald Trump makes sense. So much of social media makes sense.

Attacks on 'lenient' judges harm society

Alarm at supposed youth gangs in Australia is not new. But the current response to claimed Sudanese gangs has a fresh and disturbing aspect: the attack by politicians and their media allies on judges and magistrates for lenient sentences and the granting of bail. Such attacks have harmful consequences.

Almost everyone in the country lives with a mask on. No one dares to speak his mind or tell the truth. The totalitarian government is censoring at every corner of the streets; heavily armed police is guarding all the train stations, subways or above the ground. People are looking at each other with angry eyes. There is resentment in too many people’s lives. Not just a return to the atmosphere of the Cultural Revolution, the CCP has made the whole country a prison.
Lady Tianyi Liu is too bored; she has nowhere to express her boredom but write an erotic novel Occupy to produce some gay pornography. On 31 October, Liu was sentenced 10 years to jail by the People’s Court of Wuhu for making and selling “obscene material” for profit.
In the same week, China’s top cyber authority have wiped almost 10,000 accounts from various social media sites, accusing them of posting vulgar and “politically harmful information”.
There is an old saying in China, “The magistrates are free to burn down houses, while the common people are forbidden even to light lamps”. While corrupt CCP officials like Wang Qishan accused of corruption and sex scandals by Miles Kwok, backed by concrete evidence, is not even questioned by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, persecuting a novelist with different expression of life, in the eyes of China’s so-called rule of law, is like smashing a little ant to death.
Controversy has broken out at the Golden Horse awards on Saturday when Fu Yue, who won the best documentary award, said in her acceptance speech that she hoped Taiwan would be recognised as “independent”.
Fu, whose documentary Our Youth in Taiwan was about the island’s 2014 Sunflower Movement, said that “I hope one day our country will be recognised and treated as a truly independent entity. This is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese.”
In a normal society of Taiwan, Ms Fu Yue has the right to speak her minds, but her remarks were immediately turned down by China’s social media, together with criticism of nearly all actors and actresses amid the audience. And live Broadcast of Golden Horse Awards was then interrupted by Chinese government censorship instructions.
Following Fu’s remarks, shots of actress and jury chair Gong Li, who is from mainland China, showed her looking livid, while Taiwan-born director Ang Lee, head of this year’s executive committee, grimaced. Gong later refused to join Lee onstage to present the award for best feature film, a move many interpreted as a protest. Variety reported.
“Refusing to give the award was probably the strongest counterattack Gong Li could make at the time. She seemed to be saying, ‘As jury chair, I draw a clear line between us,’” said one post on China’s WeChat social media platform, echoing a common refrain.
As a quick reaction to Fu’s independent remarks, Chinese most noted actress Fan Bingbing updated her Weibo timeline by re-tweeting a pro-China post from a state account, making her first mark on the social network since she published a letter of apology for tax evasion in early October.
Fan shared the post on Saturday that was first published by The Communist Youth League of China, saying “China cannot miss out on any inch,” together with a map of China that includes Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Miles Kwok, god of war against the CCP, has said that all private entrepreneurs in China are like prostitutes under the pander of a brothel. (He is referring to the CCP as the pander). And all actors and actresses in China are even inferior to prostitutes under CCP’s rule.
China has one of the most booming TV drama industries in the world, with dozens of new dramas being released every month, drawing in millions of viewers through the country’s most popular online video streaming platforms, including Tencent Video, iQiyi, Sohu, Youku, LeTV, 360kan, Sogou Video, along with Baidu’s and Weibo’s videos.
Once again last week the CCP authorities criticized Hunan TV station or Mango TV of producing “too much entertaining programs”, ordering the TV station to give the golden times in the evening to propaganda programs that “bring about a clear stream to the audience”.
Earlier this year, the CCP Central Leading Group for Inspection Work inspected Mango TV and found out the problem of “excessive entertainment.” The local Hunan provincial government was alerted and quick to act by imposing strict measures for “improvement”.
“With a good understanding of the government’s policy”, Mango TV produced a series called “Xi’s words are close to the minds of the people”, with anchors detailing on the “slogans” and “great thoughts” of President Xi Jinping during the golden period after dinner. But according to statistics, the TV station lost nearly 80% of its audience with the propaganda series.
Miles Kwok says the top CCP officials only want and care for their own items of entertainment, which are diverse, colorful and out of normal person’s expectations. They have made the Central TV station their own imperial palace and the beautiful girls there their concubines. Local government officials have followed suit with their local entertainers. But they don’t allow the young viewers to entertain themselves with some funny things of their own when they are warned to be cautious with politics and ideology. This is a total disgrace of the Chinese people.
Earlier, according to Reuters, China’s censors have a new target in a widespread clamp-down on popular culture: the country’s nascent hip-hop scene, which resonated with Chinese youth last year on hugely popular television show “Rap of China.”
Hip hop artists Wang Hao, known as “PG One” and Zhou Yan, known as “GAI” – the two winners of the show – have been sanctioned for bad behavior or content at odds with Communist Party values. GAI was pulled from hit show “The Singer”.
The crackdown on hip-hop, still very much a new genre in China, reflects a broader squeeze on popular culture as the country’s stability-focused leadership looks to rein in potential platforms for youthful dissent, Reuters reported.
Beijing is eager to use popular culture to shape public opinion, including co-opting rap artists ahead of its five-yearly congress last year. With state support comes the insistence that Party values must take center stage in the artists’ work.
The official Xinhua news agency wrote that PG One “does not deserve the stage,” and that “we should say ‘no’ to whoever provides a platform for low-taste content.” Other official media and companies quickly followed suit; the rapper’s tracks were soon pulled from most online sites.
In the beautiful land of the Middle Kingdom, a flock of abnormal people was under the rule of crazy minds. How deplorable that is! And who would save them from the sadness and sufferings?
Let’s wait for the Press Briefing by the god of war Miles Kwok tomorrow at 10:00am.
Everything is just beginning.

We will be outside the Austin on Thursday 17th of April from 7.00am - 8.30am, followed by a hot beverage and debrief at a nearby cafe. Please RSVP below if you plan on attending.

Turning Tragedy into Triumph
Helping Lawyers & Clients Transition from Litigation to Life
When a person suffers an injury, it can have devastating consequences on their life, their family and their financial situation. The ability to earn a living can be lost. Sky high medical bills can accumulate in the blink of an eye and credit can be ruined as a result. These same issues can cause the rapid depletion of a personal injury recovery post settlement or verdict. Healthcare liens can be asserted against the settlement monies which have to be resolved compliantly. Injury victims can lose crucial public benefits as a result of the settlement. Traditional money management models and products aren’t designed for injury victims and frequently result in mismanagement or financial loss.
“Meaghan’s story” is an excellent example of an individual successfully transitioning from litigation into life after Meaghan Jones* was rendered quadriplegic as a result of an automobile accident. Prior to the accident, Meghan had just begun her journey into a career in the arts. She was regularly performing as a hostess/singer at a local comedy club and was pursuing a full-time career in singing and acting. Right before the accident, she had been placed on a short list for acceptance to Julliard, one of the most prestigious performing arts schools in the country.
The Many Facets of Recovery
Our company first became involved with Meaghan as she neared the close of the litigation resulting from her accident. Her dedicated trial attorneys requested assistance as the settlement created some unique concerns that needed to be addressed. Issues like public benefits preservation and healthcare lien resolution. Synergy’s Settlement Asset Management Special Needs Trust was the perfect financial/public benefit solution in her case. Not only is the trust set up in a fashion that protects needs-based benefits, it also provides a combination of income and growth that will help with her immediate living expenses as well as long-term needs.
Meaghan continues to work closely with our team since the resolution of her case. Never one to shy from a challenge, she has enjoyed learning about finance and investing as well as being involved in the planning process for her future. Additionally, our lien resolution department has been working with Meghan and her trial attorneys on resolving the outstanding Medicaid lien asserted at the close of litigation. This significant part of maximizing her settlement is not only providing sound financial advice, but also ensuring that all outstanding healthcare liens are reduced and resolved as well. This comprehensive approach has been helpful in achieving these goals and we consider ourselves lucky to work with clients like Meaghan every day as they transition from litigation into life.
After an injury, rehabilitation is only one facet of the road to recovery. Ensuring the client’s financial future and ongoing medical care is secured can be as important to their vital mental and emotional recovery, as doctors and therapists are to their physical condition. Like qualified and experienced trial lawyers are essential to achieving an equitable verdict, so consulting with settlement specialists is essential to the long-term success of any personal injury litigation.

GLOBAL CLIMATE IMPACTS OF A POTENTIAL VOLCANIC ERUPTION OF MOUNT AGUNG...
Posted by David Pike 30sc on October 05, 2017

An example of a stratovolcano eruption (note: not Mt. Agung). On July 13, 2015, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 took a close up of Mount Raung's summit caldera (on the Indonesian island of Java). Visible is afternoon cloud cover and an eruption plume. Image courtesy of NASA.
Recent weeks have seen an increase in the number of earthquakes happening below Mount Agung, a 9,944ft (3,031m) high volcano in eastern Bali, Indonesia. Authorities have evacuated nearly 50,000 people in the vicinity of the volcano in light of a potential eruption. In addition to concern for people’s lives and infrastructure, the tourism industry fears the potential for disrupted flight plans...
Mount Agung erupted last in 1963, killing over 1,000 people. As is common with large explosive eruptions, it also injected significant amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere (at least 16-18km above the surface). There, sulfur dioxide combined with water to form sulfuric acid aerosols. These aerosols reflect incoming solar radiation, causing cooling of the Earth’s climate. In fact, volcanic eruptions have been the most important external driver of interannual to decadal variability in global mean surface temperature for at least the past millennium1.
The cooling of global mean temperature from the 1963 eruption amounted to about 0.2 to 0.3°C, although it is difficult to precisely quantify from the noisy observational record where temperature variations unrelated to the volcanic eruption can occur simultaneously2. After such eruptions, global temperature eventually recovers to pre-eruption levels, but both the peak cooling and the recovery time depend on the magnitude and evolution of the eruption; that is, the amount of sulfur dioxide that is emitted and the duration of the eruption.
The second half of the 20th century has seen only two other large eruptions of comparable magnitude: El Chichón in 1982, and Pinatubo in 1991. As with the 1963 Agung eruption, all left significant imprints on climate, most prominently in global temperature but also in global ocean heat content and sea level3, the carbon cycle4, precipitation and streamflow5.
Scientists have been analyzing the precious data that emerged from these rare events for decades. For example, these eruptions serve as test beds for climate models and their ability to simulate the response to energy balance perturbations such as those arising from the reduced incoming solar radiation after volcanic eruptions6. However, it has been over 26 years since the last large eruption and the observing systems in place at that time were relatively primitive. Now, there are a number of new observing systems in place (most notably satellites such as the NASA A-Train and ARGO floats that measure ocean conditions at depth) that have never been tested during such an eruption. These systems could provide critical new measurements to improve our understanding of volcanic impacts on climate and the Earth system, which in turn will serve as an important test of climate models.
Coincidently, the three major eruptions since 1950 were contemporaneous with the warm phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), called El Niño events. During these natural events, large amounts of energy are redistributed from the tropical Pacific Ocean around the world, typically leading to a bump in global temperature of about +0.1 to 0.2°C.
While it remains debated whether volcanic eruptions themselves are able to trigger El Niño events, scientists recognized the tendency for volcanic cooling to be balanced by a warming El Niño event in the last about 60 years. Using climate models, such confounding effects have been estimated and removed7,8, revealing that when such effects are taken into account, climate models are significantly better at simulating the global temperature response to eruptions than was previously thought8.
So what should we expect global temperature to do if Mount Agung erupts again within the coming months? While the general forecasting of volcanic eruptions has improved greatly over recent decades – saving many lives like on Bali today – we still cannot predict when exactly an eruption will occur, what its strength will be, and how long it will last. These are all critical factors that determine the response of temperature and other climate aspects to a potential eruption and thus we cannot currently make reliable climate forecasts associated with it. We can think through possible scenarios, though.
The NOAA Climate Prediction Center in its latest ENSO forecast advisory (2nd October 2017) gave a 55-60% chance for the development of a La Niña during this coming winter. La Niña is the counterpart to El Niño and typically causes global mean temperature to be lower than it would be if ENSO conditions were neutral.
One scenario to think through could thus be a major eruption occurring during a La Niña this coming winter. Using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble9 (CESM) we can estimate, at least with a climate model, how much the volcanic cooling might be amplified through the coincidental occurrence of a La Niña. The CESM simulations consist of 40 historical simulations, all of which include a representation of the three volcanic eruptions as they occurred in 1963, 1982, and 1991. While imperfect, the CESM does a decent job of simulating the global mean temperature response to recent volcanic eruptions8. We then subsample the 40 historical simulations of the CESM according to whether the eruptions occurred during an El Niño or a La Niña.
Here we use the model information from all three late 20th Century eruptions even though Pinatubo and El Chichón are obviously located in different parts of the world, and erupted with somewhat different strength than Agung. However, they are all located in the tropics close to the Equator, which allows the sulfur dioxide injected into the stratosphere to spread easily across the hemisphere, thus maximizing its impact on global climate. Research has shown that the location and season of an eruption can also influence the characteristics of its climate impact, although decisively less than the eruption strength and duration10,11.
As expected, the CESM suggests that an eruption comparable in magnitude to the 1963 Mount Agung eruption occurring during a La Niña would lead to significantly more cooling than if ENSO neutral conditions coincided with it (Figure 1). Similarly, such an eruption would cool significantly less if it happened during an El Niño. The CESM on average suggests almost 0.3°C cooling for an eruption during a La Niña and less than 0.1°C during an El Niño.
The model also suggests that for an eruption of this strength, global temperature should return to pre-eruption levels within about 5 years, irrespective of which ENSO state prevails during the eruption (Figure 1).
Figure 1: (Left) Composite global mean surface temperature anomaly from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM) during the three volcanic eruptions Agung 1963, El Chichón 1982, and Pinatubo 1991. Anomalies are relative to the 5-year mean preceding the eruption. The CESM simulations have 40 members, yielding 120 simulations of the 3 eruptions. Once the 120 simulations are subsampled according to ENSO state during the eruption, they reveal how El Niños dampen and La Niñas exacerbate the volcanic cooling. Time series are filtered with a 1-2-1 filter, the shading shows 5-95% uncertainty range, the lines are the ensemble mean, and the blue and red bars indicate when the ‘El Niño’ and ‘La Niña’ cases differ significantly from the ‘All’ cases. (Right) Scenarios of annual mean global temperature evolution if an Agung­-like eruption occurred in 2017, constructed by adding the ensemble of temperature anomalies from the left panel to random ensemble members from CESM in 2017. Observations are from the Berkley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) dataset.
These cooling estimates need to be kept in mind when we turn to other comparisons of climate models with reality. For example, in the heated debate over whether climate models are overestimating the global warming response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations, such nuances become important. CMIP5 and the last IPCC assessment were based on simulations that were forced, among other things, with observed volcanic eruptions up until 2005. At the time, that was all that was available and climate models did not therefore include volcanic eruptions after 2005. In reality, however, a number of smaller eruptions did occur after 2005 and thus caused some expected discrepancy with the model simulations12.
To address this issue, scientists are now producing climate projections that include hypothetical future volcanic eruptions, which enables us to answer more quantitatively the question of whether we should expect the effect of volcanic eruptions on climate to be different in a warmer future compared to the past13,14.
Current forecasts, whether statistical or dynamical, as to how warm the years 2017 and 2018 will be, would clearly be affected by a new eruption of Mount Agung (at least if it is similar in strength and duration to the three largest late 20th century eruptions). As illustrated in Figure 1, global temperatures within the next two years could easily drop as low as what they were in 2012 at the end of the infamous "global warming slowdown". Further, given the recovery time of global temperature after an eruption, some discrepancies with CMIP5 model projections until the beginning of the 2020s might also be expected.
This example also shows that global temperature, albeit popular, is not the most robust quantity to measure changes in Earth’s climate. Even absent a strong external forcing, global temperature can vary substantially from year to year, making it difficult to separate the signal from the noise in case of a volcanic eruption or increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Instead, scientists propose to look at quantities such as global sea level or ocean heat content to take the pulse of our planet15. Those quantities integrate the response of the climate system over very large volumes, thus beating down the noise relative to the signal.

COMING SOON: SOME GREAT ACTING BUT LAME MOVIES
The Toronto International Film Festival, has, as it always does, given the first reliable indication of which films and actors will be in contention for honors at awards time.
Its reputation as a showcase for potential winners remains intact but this year several of the highly anticipated and touted movies failed to arouse much interest.
George Clooney's Suburbicon, Alexander Payne's Downsizing, Aaron Sorkin's Molly's Game and Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's The Current War all suffered from muddled scripts and unsatisfactory storylines.
Many performances were better than the movies they were in and
Emma Stone with Billie Jean King
it has so far been a year for outstanding acting, particularly from the women. Jennifer Lawrence turns in a remarkable tour de force in Darren Aronofsky's mad house-of-horrors extravaganza; Emma Stone is excellent as former tennis champ Billie Jean King in the delightful Battle of the Sexes; Sally Hawkins deserves a nomination for her role as a deaf mute cleaner in Guillermo del Toro's Beauty and the Beast-style fairy story The Shape of Water and Frances McDormad is terrific as a mother seeking her daughter's killer in Martin McDonagh's outrageously funny, sad, shocking and riveting Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, the winner of the People's Choice Award.
Jennifer Lawrence in mother!
Then there's Judi Dench in Victoria and Abdul, Jessica Chastain in Molly's Game and Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird.
On the male side, Gary Oldman gives a towering performance as Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hours; Liam Neeson overcomes a saggy script as Deep Throat in Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House; and Steve Carell is excellent as Bobby Riggs in Battle of the Sexes.
So expect some wonderful performances although some are in pretty lame movies.

BATTLE OF THS SEXES REPLAYED ON SCREEN
Emma Stone and Billie Jean King
In 1973 Billie Jean King, 29, was the top women's tennis player in the world and Bobby Riggs, 55, was a former champion, having won both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
While King was campaigning for women's equality Riggs was insisting women's place was in the kitchen and the bedroom.
Their on-court confrontation in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome was dubbed the Battle of the Sexes and became a social debate that rang around the world. It was watched by 90 million television viewers.
Talking Battle of the Sexes with Emma Stone
Now a new film, Battle of the Sexes, recreates that epic match with Oscar winner Emma Stone playing King and Steve Carell as the bombastic Riggs.
Billie Jean King, now 73, was on hand as a consultant and was with Stone at the Toronto film festival where the film had its premiere. Riggs died in 1995 aged 77.
Stone, who in the movie looks uncannily like the way King looked back then but in real life is nothing like her, says: "The match was a true historical event and obviously Billie Jean is an icon for
equality and LGBTQ rights and she's effected so much change in the world so it's really wonderful to tell this story about someone whose shoulders we stand on.
"But on the other hand it's really disheartening that a lot of the themes in the film are still an ongoing struggle today. There's still a massive amount of inequality and lack of equal pay across all industries."
For the record, King won the match 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

NEWLY SINGLE ANGELINA JOLIE: 'I AM JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH MY DAYS'
​If she didn't have a movie to promote it is highly unlikely Angelina Jolie would be sitting in a hotel suite talking ---albeit reluctantly---about her personal problems and her life since separating and filing for divorce from Brad Pitt last September.
But she is a show business veteran and the movie she directed, the Cambodian-set drama First They Killed My Father, needs publicity. So she is submitting to a long weekend of interviews and photographs while admitting: "This is the first time I have been doing this for a long time. It’s not easy. I am a little shy at this time, because I am not as strong inside as I have been in the past."
Angelina directing on the set in Cambodia
The past year, with its emotional and physical problems, has clearly taken its toll on the 44-year-old actress who is looking thin and gaunt.
"It's been difficult," she acknowledges. "I don't enjoy being single. It's not something I wanted. There's just nothing nice about it. It's just hard.
"Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it all together, but really in fact I am just trying to get through my days.
"Emotionally it’s been a very difficult year and I have had some other health issues. So my health is something that I have to try to monitor ."
with Angelina at the Four Seasons hotel
Four years ago she caused a worldwide stir by announcing she had undergone a preventative double mastectomy after learning she had an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer. Her mother had breast cancer and died of ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56 while her grandmother had ovarian cancer and died aged 45.
Two years later she had her ovaries removed and last year, in addition to hypertension, she developed Bell's palsy, causing one side of her face to droop. She recovered from that through acupuncture.
"So much in life you just focus on how much worse it could be," she says. "And I am so happy I don’t have cancer, and I am so happy that I have had the surgeries and hopefully that will prevent me from getting cancer. And if I get it, it will be delayed a few years and chemo will be delayed a few years and the exchange for that peace of mind is quite good. I feel sometimes yes, that my body has taken a hit with all of the things that I had to do, but I try to laugh as much as possible .
"We tend to get so stressed that our children feel our stress and they need to feel our joy and have joy and I think for everything that we go through, just living every day, and while you are healthy and even if you are going through chemo, find the ability to live and love and laugh."
She paused and smiled. "It may sound like a postcard, but it’s true."
Her six children clearly feature prominently in her thoughts as well as her conversation and she is applying for sole custody of them while negotiating the terms of her divorce from Pitt.
All six---Maddox, 16; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh, 11; and the nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne---were with her in Cambodia for the four-months she spent directing First They Killed My Father, based on Loung Ung's 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung's parents and two of her siblings perished along with an estimated two million other Cambodians.
She has been a Cambodian citizen for a decade and owns a house in the country near the Thai border, so the time they spent there was of special significance to her and Maddox, who was born there and whom she adopted when he was three months old. "I had met Loung and I asked her how she would feel, as a Cambodian orphan, if I adopted a Cambodian orphan. She was very supportive and had she not been my life would have been very different.
"So she has known Mad his whole life and Mad has known of Loung’s story his whole life, and I told him, 'One day son you will be ready and you will tell me when it’s time to go deeply into your country. But I need your help and you have to do it with me and you have to work and you have to be there every day and you can’t say no and that you are tired.' And one day he said, 'I am ready.'
"I really wanted Maddox to learn about Cambodian history, so I felt that this movie was a journey that we could take. And he went really deeply into the research, into the daily work and into the edit, and also having somebody younger in there to say, 'you are losing my attention,' or 'that is too complicated,' was really helpful."
He is credited as an executive producer, Pax did still photography and the other four were on set every day and were playmates of the child actors. "Seventy per cent percent of Cambodians are under 30, and so they will be the future of the country. And if they watch this film and they don’t want what happened to repeated and if they want to learn from it and move forward then they will be the ones to take the country forward."
She talks swiftly and quietly with mainly good humour. The only time she seems to become testy is when I ask her about the controversy which surrounded her casting methods for the movie. (It was reported that her team gave the impoverished youngsters money and then pretended to take it away from them, awarding roles to the children who looked the most upset.)
”I have explained it and you can look it up," she says sharply. "It was a mischaracterisation and it didn’t happen in any way that wasn’t absolutely with the thought of what is best for the child, the family and the situation."
First they Killed My Father is the fourth movie she has directed after In The Land of Blood and Honey, Unbroken and By the Sea and at the moment she has no plans either for acting, directing or both.
She and the children recently moved into an 11,000 square feet mansion once owned by Cecil B de Mille and for now she is concentrating on domesticity.
"I am actually spending most of my days just taking care of the children. I will eventually balance more and do more work, but I haven't been able to because of family issues.
"The children have been amazing," she says. "It’s been so moving to see how much they have helped each other, stood together, the big brothers helping the little kids and all of them helping me.
"They have really come into their own during this time and they are finding themselves and their voices. I know that they will have each other for life and it gives me great peace to know the day I pass away that they will have each other and they will take care of each other."
All six are taking flying lessons and their mother is spending time in the kitchen. "I am going to cooking classes," she says. "I am not sure how good I am at it. Cooking is one of those things that when you are settled in your life and you take the time and you can enjoy food and cooking but somehow I am just very impatient and I am a little bit erratic, so it’s very hard to stand in the kitchen.
"But I am getting into it now. I am really trying, because I feel like if I cook, the kids all hang out and they just love it but they often take over and tell me that they can do it better and they can all cook really well." She laughs.
Since finishing the movie she went to London as a guest lecturer at the London School of Economics, talking to the students taking the post-graduate course Women, Peace and Security about her experiences and what motivated her work as a UN special envoy.
"It's an extraordinary school, the students are so brilliant and part of the reason I wanted to teach was that I wanted to learn, too. I really wanted to hear from the generation coming up what questions they have, what their goals are and what they are finding at their age.
"I've only taken one big class so far and I'm really looking forward to going back. I'm very excited about the programme because there aren't enough programmes where you can get a Masters in this subject. and there need to be more."
If and when she returns to filmmaking the chances are it will again be as a director rather than an actor. "I get quite a lot from directing I don't get from acting," she says. "When you are an actor you emote, you have your character and you want to help the story but you're not able to sculpt the final story and pull all the pieces together so you are not telling the story, you are tell your character's part of the story.
"But to be able to oversee everything, even from the music that goes into the edit and make sure that all the pieces come together to express the story that really matters to you is something that feels very, very different. "Of course it takes much more out of you and you commit to something that is going to take a year and a half of your life whereas as an actor you maybe do two months and you think 'I like it, I'll have some fun.' But as a director you have to say, 'I love it, it has to take over my life and has to really matter to me. It has to be something that I am going to be totally immersed in.'"
In her teens and twenties Angelina Jolie was a wild child who developed a reputation for outrageous off-camera antics. Married twice, to Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1999 for playing a girl with borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-mutilation and her love of knives and she and Thornton wore each other's dried blood in pendants around their necks and publicly bragged about their wild sex.
She met Brad Pitt in 2004 on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston although she has maintained they didn't become romantically involved until after he and Aniston split up.
She has devoted the past 15 years of her life to motherhood, 12 of them with Brad Pitt. But her life has changed dramatically during the past year and now she is thinking about changing with it.
"I think now I need to rediscover a little bit of the old me," she says. "I think we lose our way a bit and we get quite overwhelmed, and I have had a lot happen in my life, from certain people passing to health issues to raising the children and a lot of things.
"And it’s been a very good time to absorb a lot and kind of develop and grow. But maybe it’s also now that my kids are growing up that I am starting to realise my own sense of play and my sense of joy have been put on hold for a while. And maybe them hitting their teens is going to bring out a little more fun in mom." She laughs.
"So maybe I am going back. It may be time."

PLENTY OF RED CARPETS IN MATT DAMON'S FUTURE
Matt Damon will be spending a lot of his time on red carpets in this year's run-up to the awards shows.
The unassuming actor is starring in two movies that so far have the best chances of Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, Downsizing and his pal George Clooney's Suburbicon.
Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig in Downsizing
In both he does what he does best---plays the Everyman caught up in unusual situations and dealing with unexpected circumstances.
But because he's good, it doesn't mean the movies are.
The bizarre Downsizing, co-written and directed by Alexander Payne, imagines what might happen if, as a solution to over-population, scientists discover how to shrink humans to 5 inches tall and propose a 200-year global transition from big to small. People soon realize how much further money goes in a miniaturized world, and with the promise of a better life Damon's character abandons his stressed life in Omaha in order to get small and move to a new downsized community — a choice that triggers life-changing adventures.
With Damon for Jason Bourne interview
"It's such a silly premise but I think that's kind of the fun of the movie," says Matt. "It's this totally ridiculous idea but if you accept that we can shrink ourselves down to 5 inches and just go with it, the movie's this beautiful satire.
"It's completely original and the one thing I can say about it is nobody's ever seen anything like it."
In the 1950s-set crime comedy-drama Suburbicon, with Clooney directing his first movie since the disastrous Monuments Men, Matt Damon stars as Gardner Lodge, a buttoned-down suburban dad who gets involved with insurance fraud and murder after a violent home invasion.
"But I am just really proud of both of these movies," says Matt. "They are very, very different from one another, but I am really proud of the fact that they both got made in the Hollywood studio system, because they are really challenging movies."
After Venice Matt is heading for Telluride and then Toronto, where I am due to meet up with him to chat some more about both movies.
More to come!

Buy to Let Fixed Rate Mortgage Deals for Limited Companies At All Time High
Housing-Market / Buy to Let Apr 23, 2018 - 03:05 PM GMT
By: MoneyFacts
Last year, the tax relief's for buy-to-let (BTL) landlords were cut, meaning that they had to start assessing their options – and becoming a limited company was one of them. With more demand for this type of company, research from moneyfacts.co.uk shows that providers have stepped into the breach and are now offering more fixed products to limited companies than ever before.
Charlotte Nelson, Finance Expert at moneyfacts.co.uk, said:
“The figures from moneyfacts.co.uk show that the number of fixed rates available to limited companies has almost tripled in the space of just two years. Reaching 235 in April, this is the highest number on moneyfacts.co.uk’s records.
“The reality of last year’s tax changes hit landlords hard, as they were unable to claim tax relief. However, with things working slightly differently for limited companies, many landlords have started to shift their focus from individual ownership to this type of private company.
“Providers who are still eager for buy-to-let business have put their best foot forward and are now offering more products than ever to meet this extra demand. Yet, despite there being more products on the market, under a quarter of the BTL market offers this option.
“Borrowers considering this type of mortgage should be aware that they could find themselves on a more expensive deal compared to the rest of the BTL market. For example, the average two-year fixed rate BTL mortgage, for those applying as a limited company, stands at 4.29% today. Whereas the average two-year fixed rate for the rest of the market is significantly less at 3.01%.
“With all the extra legwork that becoming a limited company entails, and how widely the costs can vary depending on circumstances, any borrowers considering it should consult a financial adviser and do the sums before committing to this option.”

What’s The Worst That Could Happen?: 2012
What’s The Worst That Could Happen?
The running thoughts of Matthew Janes

Fear and Loathing in the 2012 Election
Once again it is time to rant about the cesspool that is American politics. I am sure to lose sleep for the next month worrying about what may happen. As of today, FiveThirtyEight has things looking better than they could be, but the direction has been unpleasant since the debate on Wednesday.
I, of course, support Obama and the Democrats. They are moderately acceptable, whereas I have a passionate hatred of the Republicans. And yes, that level of partisanship leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I am too much of a radical with no hope of understanding the average American voter. Admittedly I have a hard time relaxing and not worrying under normal circumstances. But my level of loathing the opposing side is not that uncommon in America these days, given what I see in the news. I cannot say that is anything new, my personal participation in American politics only goes back ten years, but to see the negative effects this has had on American today, you have to look no further than the deadlock in Congress over the last two years. Despite this, the best advice I can give is to fight harder and crush the other side.
My desires for American politics are many. I want a reduction in the income inequality that has been dramatically increasing the last several decades in America. Increase investment in our infrastructure, education and scientific research. Improve the disaster that is the American health care system, though I think Obamacare is a step in the right direction; I would prefer something with the simplicity of a single-payer system. I want to reform intellectual property law and protect net neutrality. We need stronger competition law and financial reform. Reduce corporate welfare. End the drug war. Repeal Citizens United and actively work to get money out of politics. Advance women's and gay rights. Increase protection for whistle-blowers. Allow an easier path for immigration. Abolish the TSA. Decrease the size of the armed forces. Close Guantanamo, abide by the Geneva Convention, and provide similar basic protections of human rights. Make far, far stronger environmental protections. And yes, what is most on people's minds these days, lower the unemployment rate, improve economic growth and reduce the national debt.
That is only a brief outline of what I want in America. On many of those issues, the Democrats are significantly better than the Republicans. With many of them, neither side pays any attention. One might even be able to convince me that the Republicans are better for a few of those. I would like to see better arguments and empirical evidence for what policies will accomplish them.
Yet before I could get to arguments, it would be difficult to bring myself to listen to the Republican Party. I admit that this is problematic. Unfortunately their pandering to anti-science, young-earth creationists and other religious bigots, the racists and homophobes, those who would drag women's rights back forty years, and all those other disgusting dregs of America leaves a hideous taste in my mouth. Beyond the general greed, stupidity and shortsightedness I see in both parties, it is the regressive discrimination tainting the Republican Party that is the root source of my partisan vitriol. Beyond that I see the Republicans as liars and hypocrites who would happily lock down the legislature in order to prevent anything positive from happening to this country that might make the next election harm them. They are actively working to disenfranchise voters. I do not feel they can be trusted.
At some of these extremes, I might be showing shades of the irrational exhibited on other side of the fence by people who listen to Rush Limbaugh. Many of those right-wingers have fears similar to mine, as much trouble as I have understanding them. And so I worry that I have simply been riled up by political theater, driven to hate the other side for the sake of my vote and money. I am not saying that I would vote Republican, but what I am saying is that there are other fights that I have become distracted from. We should actually look at why we are horribly hyper-partisan and fight desperately over some issues while ignoring so many others. Why there is relatively little middle ground on the issues we do fight over. I do not know if we are actually more divided and partisan than we have been in the past, but I do know that we should have higher standards.
There are a number of theories for what might be dividing us so: the Big Sort, the Filter Bubble, the corruption of money in politics, distortions in our electoral process caused by gerrymandering, the Electoral College, and first-past-the-post voting systems. With some of the more direct political issues listed above, we could fix them with relatively simple laws and would not even require constitutional amendments. Despite that, the state of the American political system does not give me much optimism that I will live to see any of those issues resolved. I can hope that some exogenous societal or technological change can help advance the system. In the meantime, I will be donating money, making phone calls and possibly knocking on doors. Good luck to us.

Wolfram Alpha's Social Network Analysis
A couple of weeks ago I ran across this new feature of Wolfram Alpha designed to analyze your Facebook activity. I think this is an excellent example of how to summarize and elegantly display some of the mass of social information being captured over the net. We are starting to get enough data in the social sciences that hopefully the soft sciences can be made a bit harder. We're a long ways off from what I want to do with that, but are making some progress. That is one of the reasons I liked Klout, despite the rather unfortunate taste it leaves in some people's mouths. It takes a massively complex set of data and tries to reduce it down to something easily measurable so that people can act on it.
The new Wolfram Alpha project does a good job of that. It is on a very small scale, but I am able to look at my own analysis and learn some useful information. I can see at a glance the various friend groups I'm a part of, where my friends come from, who I'm interacting with over Facebook, what time of day this interaction is occurring, broad statistics of the religions and relationship statuses of my friends, and so forth. I find it very informative.
We still have got a long long ways to go. Get Wolfram Alpha's Facebook analysis expanded to all the social networks Klout covers, and cross-reference all of that data. Have location aware services such as Google Latitude and Foursquare tied in and watch the daily flow of people. Add more economic measurements and get social network systems monitoring how money flows through society. It would be great if someone could find a way to convince people to make public, or least public after being anonymized, data from sources such as Mint.com. Of course, I didn't use Mint.com or any such system until I started writing this article. Getting enough people to plug financial measurements into social networking software for a better understanding of economics is a ways off, but perhaps that's an open market ripe for invention.
I'd give a lot to have better economic theories backed by data to inform our politicians. True, politicians don't often feel the need to back their actions with data, but there's such a massive amount of public ignorance that any tool to help would be of benefit. One study that comes to mind was asking Americans what their desired level of wealth inequality in society was. The results showed that Americans greatly underestimated wealth inequality in the US, and their desired wealth distribution was similar to what Sweden has. People, myself included, tend to have a very poor idea of the construction of society, despite the massive amount of data out there. We still need better systems for working with and displaying this data.
I want, perhaps not a Newtonian revolution that reduces the messiness of the social sciences to clean lines and equations, humans are too complex for that to be possible, but I at least want something better than we have now. If not ways to predict the future, at least better ways of visualizing what is going on around us. Now, I obviously don't think that having better data visualization will erase human ignorance, but it has to help. Making it easier for everyday people to better see what is going on can't hurt. It feels like there's a bunch of analysis being done inside companies to improve marketing or make financial predictions, and not much progress in creating broad, useful scientific theories. Perhaps I'm just not up to date on what is being learned, ignorantly dreaming of revolutionary theories, but I take comfort in things like Wolfram Alpha doing a bit to peel back the curtain.

There Went The Summer
September already. I survived the summer, just got back from Burning Man and pushing forward with work. I'd like to think that being done with Burning Man would mean I'd suddenly have a surplus of free time, but then again, my weekends will now often be devoted to Stanford football games. Or playing Skyrim, but that won't be much of a change from the last few months since I moved on from EU3.
Burning Man was excellent this year. After the ticket debacle, I saw the camp that I've been a part of in some form or another for several years left in a much reduced state. Several of our more regular members didn't return, many of the remaining splintered into different camps, and we were left with ten to twelve of us holding enough infrastructure built up over the years to fit fifty people. Fortunately we found a way out of our dilemma by joining up with another camp, Camp Charlie, and that worked out tremendously.
Camp Charlie is a group primarily from LA who apparently watched too many Charlie the Unicorn videos. This year, with our camp fragment added, Charlie numbered somewhere between eighty and a hundred people. They, or 'we' now I should say, have a spiffy art car, and our subsection provided the back end of the camp with dome, shade, kitchen and such. All told, I spent the last week meeting many wonderful people and having a great time. It was also nice to avoid being in charge of much more than spending a night cooking for a hundred people.
Hell, I've now survived two burns with Cori and am still in one piece. Oh yeah! That's another significant happening in my life in the last few months. I'm officially living with my girlfriend, signed onto a lease and everything. At four months now, but I'll consider that an accomplishment.
On the work side of my life, over the last week, while I and half our engineering team were on the playa, Bloodhound pushed out the new website that has been in production for months. Today was my first day back into the thick of coding and bug fixing and there is, as always, plenty to do, but it's great to see the new site out. After our company spent a good share of the summer working on the new website and our new exhibitor focused Retrieve application that made its debut a month ago, it is wonderful seeing the results out there and live. Now to see how that pays off in the next few months.

Back in Existence
After finally transferring this blog away from GoDaddy in SOPA/PIPA distaste, I managed to forget about it and let it sit in DNS limbo for two months. Fortunately, now it's back! Now to just write something mildly substantive...

Europa Universalis 3
My posts here have definitely fallen off the last four months. Part of that has been work at Bloodhound keeping me busy. Things there are going quite well, we're growing as fast as we can and there should be some press releases shortly. However, away from work an almost embarrassing amount of my free time since Thanksgiving has been devoted to playing Europa Universalis 3, specifically the latest expansion, Divine Wind. I can't remember the last time I was this into a game and I can't recommend it highly enough unless you'd like to save a few hundred hours of time.
I have been a fan of both strategy games and alternate history for a very long time, and EU3 is an excellent merger of the two. In many ways it is similar to the Civilization series, but is restricted to occur between the years 1399 and 1820. Due to this it can afford to have more special, specific rules and still not diverge too wildly from reality. For example, it has hard coded rules for Papal politics, the Holy Roman Empire, Scottish resistance to England, the Reformation, etc. You wouldn't be able to write something like that into a game of Civilization, where when a game starts at 4000 BCE the historical divergences would be so great that to include rules written specifically for things that occurred over the last few hundred years would leave me tearing my hair out. Admittedly, I'd love to have a system smart enough that it could automatically generate gameplay options for divergent political/religious/cultural systems, but that is a ways beyond current game design and artificial intelligence. As it is, having these specific rules written in for the setting adds a great feeling of immersion and connection to history.
Perhaps a more significant difference that distinguishes EU3 from Civ is that it has a far greater amount detail. There is enough micromanagement to keep the perfectionist in me endlessly trying to reshape world history. There are 300 plus playable countries and 1700 plus provinces making up the world. You can pick as a starting date any day over the course of the game, and the starting point is modeled with a fair deal of accuracy to match history, with all the attending countries, governments, diplomacy, wars, cultures, religions, royal marriages, and such that existed at that point in time. I still haven't finished a game yet, despite having spent more than a month on a single game. I know at some point I'll snap out of it and get bored of it, but that hasn't happened yet.
If I had to give it a criticism, aside from a few minor gameplay tweaks, it would be that I would like it to go into even more detail. It does a tremendous amount already, but I wish I could go deeper. I would like to have it do things like model demographics and spit out tables and graphs to compare against the actual historical record. Games like EU3 and Civilization never give you an easy readout of your nation's total population, or try to reduce game units to 'tons of grain' or other more tangible measurements, and I find this frustrating. I assume it is because it would be hard to ensure that the game didn't radically diverge from what would be reasonable and break the suspension of disbelief, but EU3 comes so much closer that I think with a bit more effort it could pull it off.
Maybe just because I read Guns, Germs and Steel at a young age, I would prefer if the game would better model agriculture and disease. In the game, New World societies are handicapped with a low tech level as they were in reality, but I would like to see that handicap modeled in more detail with a lack of domestic animals and weakness to Old World diseases being some of the cause of the handicap. Then you could better model the Columbian Exchange, and see things such as how earlier or later colonization could lead to a different rate of introduction of crops, and see how those spread around the world and affect population levels and trading.
Similarly, I would like better economic models, to be able to see where traded items go instead of just having them make you money. In EU3 a province makes a trade good which gets you a certain amount of money, and your traders compete at a center of trade to make you a certain amount of money, and goods can give global bonuses if you have enough market share, but there's not much connection beyond that. I'd love to see supply and demand and see how the goods are flowing around the globe. This would better reflect historical occurrences such as how the breakdown of the Silk Road was an impetus for Europeans to seek overseas routes to the Far East.
Somewhat connected with trading and economics, I would prefer if the modeling of roads, rivers, canals and other transportation were done with more realism, with easy to see maps of how long it takes to get from Point A to Point B by what means. Have rivers reduce transportation time, and canals actually connect rivers, and have that tie in with the trading system.
Beyond that, I'd love to see more detail on the family trees of ruling families... and there if I continue along this path, I'll be down a rabbit hole and I could spend as much time thinking about what to add to the game as I do playing it. As it is, it does a better job of providing a tremendous amount of detail in a simulation/strategy game and still making it addictively playable. It may be the best strategy game I have played.
Though I am looking forward to the engine on the new Sim City game which is apparently doing an agent based simulation of every single human/vehicle in an entire city!

To be an individualist and libertarian is to understand that no one, anywhere, should ever be aggressed against by anyone, and that the state is the principal form of institutionalized aggression in our world.— Anthony Gregory
"Political tags, such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth, are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire."
-- Robert A. Heinlein

Plastics: Possible Impacts on Children’sHealth
Written By BiharWatch on Tuesday, January 13, 2009 | 7:04 AM
Phthalates and Bisphenol A (BPA), can act as “endocrine disruptors” in animal.Similar hormonal like activity in human systems is possible.
Health effects attributed to endocrine disrupting compounds include a range of reproductive problems (reduced fertility, male and female reproductive tract abnormalities, and skewed male/female sex ratios, loss of fetus, menstrual problems changes in hormone concentrations; early puberty; brain and behavior problems; thyroid hormone and gland changes; impaired immune functions; and various cancers)
These chemicals can leach from plastic containers into foods and beverages causing exposure from dietary ingestion. In addition, children may be exposed through inhalation from these chemicals in dust and through the skin from dermal transfer.
Detectable concentrations of these chemicals have been found in blood, urine, breast milk, and amniotic fluid in the general population. There are only a few human studies focusing on in utero or childhood exposures, so most of our knowledge of potential health effects stems from published animal studies.
Phthalates
Phthalates are man-made chemicals used as a “plasticizer” in a variety of industrial and commonly used products. These chemicals are anti-androgenic and can adversely
impact androgen sensitive tissues during specific windows of development.
Animal Studies (all are high dose exposures in utero) - significant testicular toxicity in utero and in early development (testicular dysgenesis syndrome)
- increased incidence of male reproductive tract abnormalities in offspring of prenatally exposed rats including hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and testicular tumors
- decreased birth weight after prenatal exposure
- kidney and liver malignant tumors (not thought to be relevant to human
exposures) Human Studies
- prenatal phthalate exposure has been associated with a decreased
anogenital distance (marker of androgenization), reduced penile
size, and incomplete testicular descent
- phthalate exposure through breast milk has been associated with increased LH, decreased free testosterone and increased serum human binding globulin in 3 month
old male infants
- early childhood exposure to phthalates has been associated with increased rhinitis, eczema, asthma, wheezing
- several studies relate phthalate exposure with abnormal sperm morphology/sperm DNA damage in adult males
Bisphenol A
Bisphenol A is a man made chemical used in hard, polycarbonate plastics. BPA acts as a
pro-estrogenic substance in the body. It has chemical properties similar to estradiol and can impact biological systems in very low doses.
Animal Studies
- neurotoxic, stimulates estrogen receptors in brain, prenatal exposures lead to changes in behavior including hyperactivity, increased aggression, impaired
learning
- prenatal exposure is associated with early puberty and increased mammary tumors in offspring, increased risk of prostate hypertrophy
- prenatal exposure associated with increased adipocytes and increased body weight in offspring
- adult exposure associated with modulation of helper T1 and T2 cells which in turn adversely affects antibody production
Human Studies
- extensive evidence that humans are exposed at concentrations similar
or higher than doses used in several animal studies that document adverse health effects
- no epidemiologic studies published examining human health effects.
Sources of Phthalate and Bisphenol A Exposures
There isn’t a disclosure requirement or comprehensive list to aid consumers in
identifying plastic containers with Phthalate or Bisphenol A. However, Recycling
Codes can be a clue to phthalate or BPA containing products Phthalates
Vinyl (Polyvinyl Chloride – PVC) – PVC tubing, clear food and non-food packaging,
medical tubing, wire and cable insulation, film and sheet, construction products such as pipes, fittings, siding, floor tiles, carpet backing, plastic toys and other flexible plastics.
Phthalates can also be found in several cosmetics and personal care products such as lotion, aftershave, and perfumes/cologne.
Bisphenol A
#7 is considered the “other category” This can include hard, polycarbonate plastics
such as those used in water bottles for hiking/camping, or baby bottles and sippy cups.
Bisphenol A is also used in can linings and products with thin plastic film coatings such as yogurt containers.
Tips on How to Avoid Exposure
Phthalates
• look for recycling code and avoid use of
#3 when possible
• do not microwave food/beverages inplastic
• do not microwave or heat plastic cling wraps
• use alternatives to plastic packagingwhen possible
• buy phthalate-free toys or those approvedby the European Union (the EU has
placed a ban on using certain types of phthalates in children’s toys) (any handy
website to refer to?)
Bisphenol A
• look for recycling code and avoid use of#7 (may or may not contain Bisphenol Awhen possible
• if using hard polycarbonate plastics (nalgene/baby bottles/sippy cups), take precautions. Do not use for warm/hot liquids, discard old scratched bottles
• use safe alternatives such as glass or poly ethylene plastic
• choose canned foods from makers who don’t use BPA (i.e. Eden foods)
• try to buy soups/milk/milk products incardboard cartons

UAE, S Korea to develop green-powered grid
Abu Dhabi, September 16, 2012
Denmark-based Global Green Growth Institute is teaming up with Masdar Institute and South Korea’s Research Institute for Industrial Science and Technology to design a micro-grid operating on 100 per cent renewable energy.
The project is supported by approximately $1 million from GGGI and POSCO, the world’s fourth largest steel producer.
The announcement of this collaborative UAE-South Korea research project, which is led by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Directorate for Energy & Climate Change and coordinated by the GGGI, was made during the project launch event, which was held at Shangri-La Hotel in Abu Dhabi.
During the event, the joint project team between Masdar Institute (MI) and Research Institute for Industrial Science and Technology (RIST) revealed a conceptual design for an island-based renewable micro-grid.
The conceptual design consists of a control system, energy storage, and a high efficiency DC distribution system. It is designed to incorporate renewable energy sources such as solar PV, small wind power and biofuel production from waste and algae. The micro-grid system can be linked to local seawater desalination and electric powered boats for island access.
The Public Private Partnership project is coordinated by GGGI and will tap the expertise of Masdar Institute in the design and simulation of micro-grids with renewable energy, and the RIST team’s established expertise in commercializing technologies demonstrated by the project on Jeju Island, South Korea.
MI proposed an initial concept for the project to GGGI on October 2010 and the GGGI UAE Country team provided MI an essential link to an industrial Partner within GGGI’s partnership network – RIST.
The 100 per cent renewable energy micro-grid project features new research collaboration potential between the UAE and South Korea. Korea is expanding smart grid technology rapidly and already hosts a successful demonstrations project on Jeju Island.
The project island in the UAE will become a ‘sister’ island, featuring advanced micro-grid and ‘smart renewable’ technologies.
Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE’s special envoy for Energy and Climate Change and CEO of Masdar, said: “This project is another powerful example of the leading role Abu Dhabi and the UAE are playing in clean energy innovation. Masdar has funded development projects on small islands that can potentially benefit from micro-grids, and we are interested in their potential role in supporting renewable energy deployment in rural areas.”
Dr Fred Moavenzadeh, president of Masdar Institute, said: “The first UAE-South Korea collaborative research project under the GGGI program reflects the common interest between the two countries to partner with each another on clean energy ventures.”
“It will benefit from the synergy between Masdar Institute and RIST, which already has a track record in implementing a similar project in Korea. We believe the micro-grid project will bear testimony to our expertise in furthering research and innovation in sustainability while developing the UAE’s human capital as directed by the country’s leadership.”
Dr Hee Don Chun, executive vice president of RIST, said: The UAE project will benefit from the outcomes of research already conducted on Jeju Island and we are confident the expertise from Masdar Institute will further stimulate innovation in micro-grids which is optimized in Mena region environment. In addition, RIST will seek further opportunities for collaboration with MI in terms of green technology research based on each institute’s core competence.”
Dr Scott Kennedy, dean for Research, Masdar Institute, said: “Micro-grids are gaining increasing popularity as a key enabler of smart grid infrastructure and an important technology in expanding electricity access to areas with weak or non-existent power infrastructure.
“Such grids are essentially small, low to medium voltage power systems that can operate in isolation or connected to a larger transmission system. Featuring advanced control systems that allow them to operate in grid-connected or isolated mode, they can also include up to 100 per cent renewable energy, therefore providing zero-carbon power.”
The joint team will develop a UAE tailored micro-grid model and an action plan for a subsequent implementation project until March, 2013. The developed micro-grid model will be highlighted during the World Future Energy Forum in January 2013 in Abu Dhabi. – TradeArabia News Service

Court Rules TSA 'Above the Law', Can't Be Sued - Truth And Action
Court Rules TSA ‘Above the Law’, Can’t Be Sued
At some point in your life, you’ve probably held contempt for the TSA. Well, the situation is about to get even worse.
Despite the claimed necessity of the TSA, it’s easy to dislike the organization, They’re rude, invasive, and sometimes violent. They’re the reason why people miss their flights — and if you mention that you’re running late, they’re likely to work even slower. You’ll also get a lecture.
If that’s not bad enough, TSA agents have also been caught stealing and smuggling cocaine while on the job.
So it’s easy to root against the organization in a court of law — as any of the above crimes are easy fodder for lawsuits.
But don’t get your hopes up. One court thinks they’re simply too important to be subject to the same laws as the rest of us.
See the fascinating ruling on the next page:

The primary purpose of our Constitution is to LIMIT the federal government. And that means that no court can declare any part of the government to be above the law.

Physicians Seeking National Interest Waiver (NIW)
Legislation enacted in 1999 makes it easier for certain foreign physicians seeking permanent residence in the second employment-based preference to qualify for National Interest Waiver (NIW). Under the 1999 legislation, the USCIS must grant a National Interest Waiver (NIW) if:
The physician agrees to work full time in a field designated by the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) as a health professional shortage area or in a Veterans Administration (VA) hospital, and
a federal agency or a state department of public health has determined that the physician's work is in the public interest.
Five-Year Aggregated Service: The physician, however, is not eligible for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status until such time as he or she has worked full time as a physician in a shortage area or VA hospital for an aggregated five years. Time in J-1 status cannot be counted towards the five-year period.
The USCIS rules clarify that the physician must agree to practice full-time in a HHS-designated Primary Medical Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) or a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSAs). Alternatively, a physician must serve at a Veterans Affairs health facility. The rules also specify that only physicians who will practice in the following fields of medicine are eligible for waivers under the 1999 law: family/general medicine, pediatrics, general internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry.
If you have any further questions regarding National Interest Waiver (NIW), please contact us. If you are interested in the services of National Interest Waiver (NIW) by North America Immigration Law Group, please refer to the processing flow of National Interest Waiver (NIW) petition.

The park was closed for two years due to delayed bidding processes
Addis Abeba River Basins & Green Areas Agency has begun the renovation of Ambassador Park at a cost of 42 million Br.
The construction of Ambassador Park, which lies on 9,393Sqm in the Arada District close to Ambassador Theatre along Ras Desta Damtew Street, began five weeks ago.
The project is expected to be completed in September 2019 and will be administered by the Arada district. Naihet Plc is engaged for the construction of the project and will include free Wi-Fi service, a cafe and a playground.
"The current number of parks and recreational areas are not enough for the residents of the city," said Abebe Kebede, public relations officer and media relation team head of the City Communication Bureau. "The city administration also plans to build parks on two areas whose lease contracts with investors have been revoked."
For the past two years, the park remained closed as bid offers submitted by contractors were considered too high, according to Adebabay Sendek, the Agency's communications director.
"The new park will fulfill the standards of a park and give better service to the public," he told Fortune.
Experts believe that rebuilding the park will have a positive impact on the tourism industry and the parks would help residents of the city enjoy their free time.
"Ambassador Park's location is very convenient, but there remains much to be done. Parks like Bihere Tsige and Sheger Park are more natural, for they have a variety of flowers, trees and shrubs," said Zerihun Mekonen, a lecturer at Lion Ethiopia Tourism and Hotel College. "The number of parks in the town is not enough for the residents, and some of the current parks are barely accessible."
Bihere Tsige Park was established in the 1960s and is known as the Semien Park of the city and holds some endemic animals.
A 132-year-old city, Addis Abeba has 20 parks, 15 of which are open to the public. On November 24, 2018, the City opened the 70-year old Anbessa Gibi Park to visitors after a three-year renovation effort.
The City Administration also plans to convert two properties, previously leased to investors but reclaimed by the city after allegations of failure to develop, to parks, according to Abeba. One parcel is part of the now-canceled expansion project for Sheraton Addis Hotel, while another is located in Piassa, across from the city municipality office.

Tale of Three Johns
Posted on January 14, 2019 by walthe310	
It was the best of Johns (Kelly)
It was the worst of Johns (Bolton)
Then there was the boss Don John (Trump)
A triumvirate of evil if ever there was
John Revoltin’ Bolton urged an attack on Iran
Gas lines here we come
Don John needs a war to distract attention
And unite the people behind him
He said so himself
May be the 20-25% of time
He is telling the truth
Trump must go

- James, transplant recipient
You’ll likely have highs and lows as you move through the months and years after transplant. During this time, there are things you can do to help your recovery and healing.

Costs after transplant may include copays for medicines or doctors’ appointments. Sometimes, people have to pay for transportation to the transplant center or temporary housing near the transplant center. Learn more about the costs you may have after transplant and what resources are available to help.
Contacting your donor
Many patients wonder about their donor and want to connect after having an unrelated donor transplant. This is a very personal choice for both you and your donor. Learn more about communicating with your donor.
If transplant doesn’t work
Sometimes transplant does not work. Your body may not accept the donated cells, or the disease may return. Learn more about these potential complications and other treatment options that may be available if transplant doesn’t work.

Additional Links: The Balancing Act
Where are you currently at in your career path and why did you decide to pursue this career path?
I’m currently in my second year of medical school. I always had the idea that I wanted to work in health care, namely because my mom is a nurse. I originally wanted to do pharmacy because I loved chemistry, but I soon convinced myself that it wouldn’t give me enough variety. After some online searching, I realized the breadth of health care that medicine covered and started envisioning myself as a physician. My dad’s voice in the back of my head telling me to pursue medicine also helped. I declared pre-med my freshman year in college and never changed.
If you could go back and have a chat with your naïve college freshman self, what would you tell her?
All things work for the good of those who love God. He has your entire life written out already. He knows what you’re going to accomplish and what you will fail at. So there’s no reason for you to overly stress and worry about things that are out of your control, because they’re in His control. Just focus on fulfilling your purpose and furthering God’s kingdom, and everything will fall into place as it should, not necessarily as you would have it. Listen to your mother—what’s meant to be will be.
What advice would you give to someone looking to pursue a similar path as yours?
This field isn’t for the weak minded. You have to strengthen your mind if you’re certain this is the path for you. You may face discouragement from those around you, and even from yourself, so you have to have the resilience to keep pushing despite that. Constantly remind yourself that you will be a doctor; envision it, engrain it, so no one can tell you otherwise. Have mentors (those older than you on the same path) that you can call that can tell you the same thing. Surround yourself with people who will only lift you up. At the same time, if you realize that medicine isn’t the calling for you, don’t force it, because if you’re in it for the wrong reasons, you’ll be miserable.
What is your favorite thing about your medical school?
My favorite thing is having friends going through the same struggle with you, so you don’t have to explain yourself. When I say I’m tired, they understand. When I say I’m too busy, there are no extra questions. When I need motivation, they know exactly what to say. We’re all on the same page. It’s refreshing. And when it’s time to celebrate, we know what time it is! Another thing I really like is the autonomy you have over your day. Yes, there’s lots of material to cover, but you can decide exactly when and how you want to handle it.
What did you do during the summer before you started medical school?
Sleep, eat, shower, repeat —with some friends sprinkled in there too. Definitely nothing school related! I used that summer get closer to God and develop a healthy habit that I wanted to continue in school, which was running. No amount of studying could have prepared me for what was to come lol. Also, keep in mind that I started med school right after undergrad.
What extra-curricular activities are you involved in at your school?
I’ll preface this by saying that I’ve always been a busy-body. I’m more productive when I have more things going on in my life. My largest and most rewarding time commitment is serving as president of out Student National Medical Association. I also serve as one of 5 student coordinators for a student-run clinic for the homeless and uninsured. Once a week I tutor/mentor elementary age children at a type of after school program in the community. Lastly, I’ve served a short time on the inaugural e-board of MCG’s new Public Health interest group.
Thank you so much for taking the time to share some of yourself with us Ijeoma! Your advice is very much appreciated as well! I totally agree with the importance of resilience on this career path. Continue to be great!

The paradisiacal perils of entrepreneurship

Taking stock of our car-loving culture	
The horses stand sullenly in the barn where they have dwelt, uninterrupted, for two years. Has it really been that long since my wife and I hopped into their saddles and sped away down the street and around the lake, the soft summer wind peeling the frowns from our faces?
The “horses” – that’s what we call our twin, hybrid two-wheelers with the fancy side bags for boxed lunches and bottles of wine. We bought them from a local outfit six years ago when we became convinced that global warming would doom the infernal combustion engine to a proper extinction. Humanity, we thought, would finally see the error of its fossil-fuel ways. Everyone would soon be riding bikes. We were just ahead of the curve in southeastern New Brunswick.
Ah yes, how young we were.
Today, the oil and gas industry is pumping away harder than ever. Production in the tar sands of Alberta, where bitumen is king, has never been higher. Now, the only fear policy makers and politicians nurse is whether they can get the stuff to market before competition drives the price down to commercially unsustainable levels.
That’s certainly what Canada’s finance minister, Joe Oliver, fears.
Speaking in Ottawa recently, he said weaning the nation from its dependence on American buyers of its black gold is, “an obvious strategic imperative.” Moreover, he added, “the Canadian economy has been bolstered by resource revenue and it’s important that we continue to see that revenue sustained and grow. . .(It’s an) asset that Canadians consider absolutely fundamental to their identity.”
I’m a Canadian, but I’m not sure I will ever perceive non-renewable reserves of oil and gas as innate to my sense of self. Aren’t they more or less necessary evils, the consumption of which we would all do well to curtail?
Yves Bourgeois of the Urban and Community Studies Institute at the University of New Brunswick might agree. “A lot of people are interested in public or shared transportation because for low-income people it’s often the only means of transportation, he told the Saint John Telegraph-Journal recently. “Decision-makers in municipal or provincial governments are often told they need to fund public transportation because it helps low-income people. . .in New Brunswick, there’s actually a compelling economic argument to fund more shared transportation.”
Still, we remain a defiantly car-loving culture.
According to the Institute, this province boasts (if that is the word) the third-highest rate of automobile ownership in the country – 1.55 cars per home. The national average is 1.47. Reports the T-J: “They also put five per cent more kilometres on their private vehicles than the Canadian average.”
Is there a causal relationship between this and another disturbing trend in New Brunswick?
“A report released by the Canadian Public Health Association says that 30 per cent of the adult population is obese in Atlantic Canada,” the CBC reported in March. “In New Brunswick, the highest rates of obesity are in the northwest, where 27.4 per cent of adults are obese and in the Acadian Peninsula, where 28.8 per cent are obese.”
Said Stephane Robichaud of the New Brunswick Health Council: “We see that we have a higher rate than the rest of the country of people dying before the age of 75 for treatable or preventable causes.”
In fact, my decision to park the car and zip around on bikes was inspired, in part, by the fact that I was turning 50, that dreaded threshold one crosses when one can no longer kid oneself about maintaining youthful vitality without expending an ounce of effort.
Still, as the first, fresh days of summer arrive, it’s not too late to take stock of our present lot. My wife and I are planning new excursions, new adventures in cycling thanks to our sturdy horses. For now, as the weather begins to cooperate, the Nissan will stay in the driveway, and once again, we will be in the wind

Arnold Schwarzenegger is Better as an Ex-Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn’t the most popular or effective governor of California. He was elected on the promise of reform, and didn’t really accomplish much of note. However, now outside of politics and unhindered by the office, he can say whatever he wants.
Today. the former governor of California and mega-movie star took to the internet to teach Donald Trump how to condemn hatred. In a video on the website ATTN:, Schwarzenegger began, “There are not two sides to bigotry, and there are not two sides to hatred. And if you choose to march with a flag that symbolizes the slaughter of millions of people, there are not two sides to that.”
Schwarzenegger’s video was a response to Trump’s claim that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the Charlottesville incident, in which white supremacists, who carried Nazi and Confederate flags, clashed with counterprotesters.
He spoke directly to Trump, saying, “As president of this great country, you have a moral responsibility to send an unequivocal message that you won’t stand for hate and racism.”
Many have sharply renounced Trump’s comments on Charlottesville, so Schwarzenegger helped write a more fitting speech. He said, “As president of the United States and as a Republican, I reject the support of white supremacists. The country that defeated Hitler’s armies is no place for Nazi flags. The party of Lincoln won’t stand with those who carry the battle flag of the failed Confederacy.”
He ended the video by saying that people must stand up to hatred and urged people to donate to their favorite anti-hate group.

HATE CRIME: Trial for Black Woman Who Killed White Boy with Blow Torch Begins

According to ClashDaily.com’s sleuth, Donald Joy– “Mona Nelson killed 12yr. old Jonathan Foster with a blowtorch. Nancy Grace dropped the story as soon as she realized it was a black woman murdering a little white boy. The media have avoided the story like the plague, never once looking into whether it was a “hate crime.” The original local news report has been removed. Suspect has sought and received legal counsel from local leadership of the New Black Panther Party. No story here, folks. Move along …”
HOUSTON (KTRK) — The trial begins today for the woman accused of kidnapping and murdering a boy.
Mona Nelson is charged with capital murder. Prosecutors say she kidnapped 12-year-old Jonathan Foster on Christmas Eve of 2010. His burned remains were found in a ditch soon after, but detectives could never come up with a motive.
Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. Nelson has asked for a judge instead of a jury to decide the verdict.

Below is the full horror story via The Daily Mail…
Mona Nelson, the woman accused of murdering Texas boy Jonathan Foster, spoke for the first time since being arrest – proclaiming her innocence.
Nelson, 44, told reporters that she would never do anything to harm a child, and that she has five grandchildren of her own
‘I’m not a monster… I love kids,’ she told a local TV station from her prison cell.
Although Nelson is adamant that she would not harm any child, it is not a view shared by police, who believe the 12-year-old Foster may not be her only victim.
The boy was reported missing from his home on Christmas Eve, after his mother claims she received a strange call at her workplace from a gruff-sounding woman.
Jonathan’s mother, Angela Davis, initially told police that he was with a babysitter. But she later admitted that he was home alone.
His burned body was discovered on Tuesday in a roadside ditch in Houston, not far from where he lived.
Nelson told to local KTRK TV that a member of Jonathan’s family gave her $20 to dump a plastic container on Christmas Eve.
She claimed she was drunk on vodka and didn’t know what was inside the container.
Murdered: The badly burned body of Jonathan Foster was found dumped in a roadside ditch in Houston
She said she chose a random Houston ditch to dump the container in.
But police revealed that Jonathan’s burned body was not discovered in a plastic container.
Nelson insisted: ‘I’m not a monster. I have five grandkids and I love kids.’
She admitted having a cutting torch, a welding instrument that police say she used to burn the body, but she said she needed it for her job as a welder.
When asked if she used it on Jonathan, she said: ‘I would never do that.’
Police allege that Nelson’s truck was spotted on surveillance footage dumping something in the ditch where the body was found.
In addition, investigators say they’ve discovered evidence at Nelson’s apartment that allegedly links her to the crime, including burned carpet and twine similar to that used to Jonathan’s hands.
Houston Police Department Homicide Detective Mike Miller called Nelson a ‘cold, soulless murderer who showed an absolute lack of remorse in taking the life of Jonathan Foster’.”
He called the boy’s death ‘an absolute tragedy that can’t be put into words’.

There are some simple fundamental truths about recruitment:
The most effective method of recruitment is word of mouth from current volunteers
People don’t volunteer unless they are asked
It is far more effective to retain a satisfied volunteer than to recruit a new one
One volunteer, who leaves after a poor experience, will do more damage than the good done by ten excellent recruitment campaigns.
There are six stages to the recruitment and selection process:
Develop volunteer roles
The first step in recruitment is to develop volunteer roles. Consider the following issues:
Clarifying what it is the volunteer will be expected to achieve
Identifying the boundaries of the volunteer role
Identifying and preparing supervisors for the role
Developing effective communication processes around the role
Establishing a suitable place of work for the volunteer
Identifying and obtaining necessary resources to enable the volunteer to fulfil the role
Ensuring relevant work is available for the volunteers to do
Developing suitable support mechanisms for the volunteers and the role
Identifying and implementing appropriate supervision
Write the volunteer job description
Once the volunteer roles have been identified, you need to develop volunteer position descriptions. Volunteer position descriptions are essential in defining the role of the volunteer in the organisation. They provide a clear process of communicating to the volunteer what the expectations and responsibilities of the role are and set the parameters and boundaries in which the volunteer is expected to work, in order to maximise their skills, knowledge and abilities.
As a guide, position descriptions should include the following elements:
Title of the role: what is the actual name of the position? (e.g. volunteer lifeguard, interpretive guide, receptionist)
The need for the role: what is the purpose of this role? Why does this job need to be done?
Time commitment: how much time and over what periods is the volunteer required to undertake this position?
Reporting/supervision: who will directly support the volunteer and who will the volunteer be accountable to? Who will the volunteer report to? Who will the volunteer work with?
Details of duties/activities: what are the specific tasks, functions and key areas of responsibility of the role?
Impact of the role: why does this role exist and how will it contribute to realizing the organisational mission and/or values?
Selection criteria: what skills, knowledge abilities or qualities are required or desirable to undertake this position? Do they need a special qualification, licence, suitability notice to undertake the role?
Benefits of the role: what skills can the volunteer gain from undertaking this role?
Training/education opportunities: ‘Professional Development Opportunities’. What opportunities are available to increase the volunteer skills, knowledge and abilities through training opportunities?
Considerations specific to the role: does the role require volunteers to be working on their own? What will the working environment be like?
Potential pathways: what opportunities does this role give for potential mobility, growth, transferability and leadership?
Develop your message and advertise
Once you have your job descriptions you can develop your message. You need to decide what you want to tell the potential volunteer about the organisation and what will encourage people to become involved. In your message you should try to address any fears that potential volunteers may have.
You can then broadcast your message through many means, including:
Online (through sites such as Volunteering Qld)
Newsletters - your organisation’s and others
Newspapers - local community newspapers can be very effective in targeting potential applicants from the local community and can also often be very cost effective
Social media and new media (e.g. Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Myspace)
Word of mouth
Community billboards
Community announcements (radio and television)
Magazines
Local employment centres
Advertising
Remember to have a process for volunteers to apply and ensure you nominate a contact person who is responsible for dealing with initial enquiries.
Interviewing volunteers
Interviewing should not only be viewed as a process to ascertain the suitability of a potential volunteer or as a job matching exercise, but should also maximise the opportunity to explore the potential and capacity of the applicant to ensure they have a meaningful experience of volunteering.
Welcoming
The first step of the interview is to ensure the potential volunteer feels comfortable and to build rapport. Do not proceed until the volunteer is comfortable.
Asking
The second step of the interview is to gain information from the potential volunteer and give them the chance to tell of their interests and their story. Some questions you may wish to consider are:
What is your reason/motivation for wanting to volunteer?
Understanding the reasons why people want to volunteer is useful in identifying and maintaining volunteers’ motivation and making an appropriate work match.
What are the things you like to do or are confident/comfortable doing?
Here you try to explore the current skills, knowledge, interests and potential of the volunteer.
What are the things you would like to do or have an interest in learning?
Too often interviewers only focus on current skills and abilities, without realising the enthusiasm and commitment of volunteers to learn new skills and abilities. If you wish to focus on capacity and potential, this question is critical.
What are the things you do not want to do and are clearly off limits?
Here you can identify what volunteers don’t like, or don't want to do, but may feel too awkward to raise.
Do you have any special needs or requirements in doing this work?
This is an important question in determining whether the volunteer requires additional support. It is important any questions regarding this topic focus only on requirements that relate to the specific volunteer job and are not general in nature. To do otherwise could be discriminatory.
Supplying
During this step of the interview, you should provide the volunteer with information regarding the organisation and the volunteer jobs.
Parting
The final stage of the interview is to ensure that both the individual volunteer and the organisation have had the opportunity to gather information and address any questions. At this time you need to summarise any decisions that have been reached and inform the potential volunteer of what will happen next, for example a reference check or setting an orientation date. The end of the interview also provides an opportunity to thank the potential volunteer for their time.
Tips
Make sure you allocate an appropriate amount of time for the interview conversation
Read the potential volunteer’s application prior to the interview
Find a comfortable place free of interruptions for your conversation
Provide information about the organisation
Clearly and honestly define the requirements, expectations and benefits of the volunteer position/s
Treat potential volunteers with respect and assess their capacity on an individual and objective basis
When asking questions of the potential volunteer always try to ask open ended questions that encourages the applicant to provide information. Open ended questions usually start with what, how, where, when, why or who
Remember the 70/30 rule where the potential volunteer should do seventy percent of the talking during the interview
Listen to what the potential volunteer is saying and what they are not saying
Explore what the potential volunteer would like to contribute to the organisation
Encourage the potential volunteer to discuss their experiences
Selection
Selection involves some process of matching the person to the role. While an organisation seeks volunteers to meet its needs, volunteers similarly seek an organisation which meets their needs. Matching therefore involves focusing on a win-win outcome for the organisation and the volunteer. The organisation must be able to look at themselves, the roles they have to offer and the way those jobs and the organisation are promoted through the volunteer’s eyes. Organisations need to be able to tell potential volunteers when the work they have available does not and never will approach the goals the volunteer has identified for themselves in volunteering.
Organisations have a responsibility to their clients and to potential volunteers to select the right people for particular roles. This may relate to legislative or organisational requirements but certainly relates to best practice volunteer management. It is essential that those responsible for selecting volunteers recognise the need to be able to say no to a volunteer’s request to work in a role for which they are not appropriate, and to reject some volunteers’ requests to work with the organisation in any capacity.
Screening
Finally, the organisation needs to consider appropriate screening mechanisms.
Screening covers the processes used to verify the background, qualifications, skills and experience of individuals prior to their appointment to a volunteer position. Screening is an important part of an organisation’s risk management strategy. It complements, but by no means reduces, the need for good practice in the recruitment, selection, training, supervision and support of volunteers and paid workers. Effective screening is especially important in those organisations where there is involvement with children or any other vulnerable group.
Screening may involve reference, police, driving record, blue card, yellow card or other checks as deemed necessary for the particular role or organisation. Screening promotes and maintains internal security. Any screening undertaken by an organisation must be done within state and federal legal requirements.

Stolen Plane Incident Raises More Questions About Airport Security
July 18, 2012 at 5:40 pm
Filed Under:Brian Hedglin, Centennial Airport, Colorado Springs, Denver International Airport, Mike Boyd, Robert Olislagers, SkyWest, St. George Municipal Airport, utah
A sign outside the Centennial Airport (credit: CBS)
DENVER (CBS4) – Right now individual airports, not the federal government, are in charge of policing their perimeters. That it didn’t stop a Colorado pilot from getting onto the grounds of the St. George Municipal Airport in Utah.
Police say Brian Hedglin was on the run after stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death in Colorado Springs on Friday. He was found dead on a plane Tuesday morning.
Many people in the aviation industry started considering the actual security of the facilities as a whole. At most airports the fence is merely a perimeter, but that’s exactly how Hedglin got access to the plane.
Investigators in St. George believe Hedglin got into a jet first by using a rug to cover razor wire on a fence. But airport managers at similarly small facilities say that doesn’t concern them.
“Incidents like this can happen at virtually any airport, but that’s why you have layered security,” said Robert Olislagers, Centennial Airport Executive Director.
Olislagers says the failed takeoff proves the system works.
Hedglin was able to get into the SkyWest plane’s cockpit and got the plane moving, but in doing so the experienced pilot damaged the plane’s wing, likely rendering it unsuitable to fly. Olislagers says the failure shows airport security is actually working.
“There’s always a way to get to the airplane, but there’s not a way to take it or complete a mission,” he said.
“To a trained terrorist most airports have the security of a laundromat,” aviation consultant Mike Boyd said.
Boyd says what happened shows a glaring hole in airport security.
“A real terrorist is not going through the screening to try to bust that. A real terrorist is going to do what this guy did — go through the back door,” Boyd said.
At Denver International Airport federal patrols monitor the inside of the airport perimeter. Private security and help from Denver police patrol the outside. That’s true at almost every airport in the country. Critics say federal patrols should focus on the fence and not the passengers.
“The problem is we don’t have airport security, we have airport screening. We have pointy object patrol,” Boyd said.
Airport managers sharply disagree. They say the industry needs to pay more attention to the licensing process for pilots. They say monitoring the mental health of pilots is critical for airline security.

November 6, 2018
November has arrived, bringing with it the season of feasts, festivities, and holiday cheer.
It also brings with it the dreary task of voting…
On November 6, 2018, the ballots will be counted, and we, the people, will have determined who rules the house — Democratic, Republican, or otherwise.
With this, Trump’s position as POTUS will be either reinforced or challenged.
That’s not what I’m here to talk about though. Politics, at this point, is a noise in the market that obscures what we should or shouldn’t be trading.
Does politics affect the market? Of course. But it’s still noise, and I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of hearing it.
Quite frankly, I’m glad it’s time to get out and vote so we can move on.
But, don’t wait until Tuesday to tune out the political noise. It’s important that you align yourself with a profit-generating system NOW to brace yourself for the resulting flux in the post-Election Day economy.
Harry has been calling it for a while now that this may be “the Big One.”
David Stockman has claimed that the Mother of All Yield Shocks is imminent.
Even Adam O’Dell has warned subscribers about some data that doesn’t bode well for the future…
The point is this: Prepare now for what’s to come. And I assure you, it is coming. And here at Dent Research, we’ve dedicated our lives to helping you not only prepare, but to profit as well.
Now, in light of this year’s upcoming Election Day, and as a lover of literature, I leave you with some food for thought.
While William Ralph Emerson may have only been an architect, and second cousin to the famous Ralph Waldo Emerson, I believe his poem to be good, and it rings true in today’s turbulent times…
A Nation’s Strength
By William Ralph Emerson
What makes a nation’s pillars high
And its foundations strong?
What makes it mighty to defy
The foes that round it throng?
It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand
Go down in battle shock;
Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,
Not on abiding rock.
Is it the sword? Ask the red dust
Of empires passed away;
The blood has turned their stones to rust,
Their glory to decay.
And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown
Has seemed to nations sweet;
But God has struck its luster down
In ashes at his feet.
Not gold but only men can make
A people great and strong;
Men who for truth and honor’s sake
Stand fast and suffer long.
Brave men who work while others sleep,
Who dare while others fly…
They build a nation’s pillars deep
And lift them to the sky.
Here’s What You Missed…

Abstract
Background: To date, there is mixed evidence on the safety and effectiveness of tiotropium. Our objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of regimens containing tiotropium versus other medication regimens for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in real-world clinical settings.
Methods: We conducted a cohort study on two separate cohorts with a diagnosis of COPD in the VA healthcare system. Patients with a COPD diagnosis prescribed tiotropium and patients in a historic cohort prior to the introduction of tiotropium were selected for comparison using propensity scores, with the base case including scores from 0.1 to 0.4. Outcomes identified during follow-up were all-cause mortality, COPD exacerbations, and COPD hospitalizations. Exposure to COPD medication regimens was defined in a time-varying manner and Cox proportional hazards regression were employed to evaluate outcomes.
Results: For 42,090 patients in the base case, the regimen of tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists was associated with 40% reduced risk of death (HR=0.60 [95% CI 0.45, 0.79]) compared to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. This combination was associated with reduced rates of COPD exacerbations (HR=0.84 [0.73, 0.97]) and COPD hospitalizations (HR=0.78 [0.62, 0.98]). Tiotropium in combination with two other medications was associated with increased risk of mortality, exacerbations and hospitalizations.
Conclusions: When used with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, tiotropium use was associated with a decreased risk of mortality compared to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. However, this result was not consistent in other medication regimens that included tiotropium.
Introduction
Patients and providers are often confronted by treatment alternatives with limited information by which to make decisions. One prominent gap in clinical information is lack of direct comparisons between treatments, as much of the evidence in clinical practice guidelines come directly from placebo control trials rather than head-to-head comparisons. Patients enrolled in trials, which employ rigid inclusion and exclusion criteria, often lead to selected populations who may be different from those ultimately using the medication.1,2 Thus, in order to complement results from placebo control trials, comparative effectiveness studies of treatment interventions are increasingly conducted to inform decision-making for more general populations.3
For the most part, guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are based on results of short-term clinical trials using intermediate endpoints and consensus of COPD experts.4,5 Importantly, the recent focus of COPD clinical trials has been on overall mortality.6,7 These trials have contributed evidence on longer-term effects of COPD medications; however, they often fail to provide evidence on comparative effectiveness of medication regimens because they focus on monotherapy. An exception is the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study that focused on combination inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, yet concerns about the generalizability of the sample remains.8
Tiotropium is the most recent addition to the treatment options available for patients with COPD. Several short-term clinical trials9-12 and trials of longer than 12 months13,14 have shown tiotropium improves lung function, symptoms and quality of life, while a six-month trial in the VA healthcare system showed tiotropium was associated with reduced COPD exacerbations.15 The recently completed Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) study showed tiotropium was associated with a reduced rate of exacerbations and COPD hospitalizations and improvement in respiratory-related quality of life.16
While evidence is growing on the efficacy of tiotropium, controversy exists with respect to overall safety. A recent meta-analysis showed an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality,17 while this meta-analysis and others have not found a significant increase in overall mortality associated with tiotropium use.18,19 As noted above, clinical trial populations may be quite different from those treated in clinical practice and the primary aim of these studies is not to evaluate the overall safety of the medication. Therefore, examining outcomes outside of clinical trials is important.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of regimens containing tiotropium versus other medication regimens for COPD. Because of medication policies in place for the use of tiotropium in the VA healthcare system, we sought to compare outcomes among a group of patients switched from to a regimen that either included (1) tiotropium or (2) inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists.
Methods
We conducted a cohort study in patients with COPD using national Veterans Affairs (VA) inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and mortality data. Tiotropium was not available prior to February 2004, and there were initial restrictions on use when introduced. For these reasons, both contemporary and historic controls were used to identify patients with characteristics similar to those treated with tiotropium. Initial restrictions required patients to see a pulmonologist and have ‘failed’ treatment with other COPD medications. Failure was indicated by an exacerbation that resulted in a hospitalization or at least two outpatient exacerbations in the last 12 months.
Subsequently, these restrictions were modified such that a visit to a pulmonologist was no longer required and failure could include significant symptoms. Because of the use restrictions and the fact tiotropium was not used as first-line treatment for patients with COPD in the VA, we compared tiotropium to other medication regimens following a regimen change.
Cohort
Patients were identified for inclusion during two periods. During the first period, patients were identified for inclusion as historic controls in order to identify patients who possessed similar characteristics to those switched to tiotropium in a more contemporary cohort. In this way, we took advantage of the fact that tiotropium was not a treatment option during identification of the historic cohort and it is not used as first-line treatment for COPD in the VA.
To be included patients had to have a COPD diagnosis (ICD-9 491.x, 492.x, 496) during a twelve month period on at least two outpatient encounters or a single inpatient discharge diagnosis and be at least 45 years of age. Patients had to have received COPD medications from the VA and switched to a regimen that included either tiotropium or inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. Patients who died less than 30 days following their medication switch and those with an asthma diagnosis were excluded. Patients from the first cohort (historic cohort) were identified between October 1, 2002 and September 30, 2003. Patients from the second cohort were identified between October 1, 2004 and March 31, 2006 (contemporary cohort).
Follow-Up Period
We defined the index date based on the date of switch to an eligible regimen. Patients were followed for up to 547 days. Patients were followed until they died, had not filled a prescription for 180 days, or 547 days, which ever occurred first.
Outcomes
During follow-up, we measured three outcomes: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) COPD exacerbations; and (3) COPD hospitalizations. Events occurring within 30 days following index date were not included. Because a medication switch may have been related to an event or an indicator of symptoms that may have preceded this event, we did not want to attribute those events to exposure to the medications during the switch. Therefore, each patient was given a 30 day immortal period following the switch. Because this period was equal for all patients, it does not introduce immortal time bias into the analysis.20-22
Deaths were identified using the VA Vital Status file, which captures approximately 98% of deaths.23 Exacerbations were identified based on ICD-9 codes related to COPD present in combination with one of the following: (1) hospitalization; (2) emergency department visit; or (3) outpatient visit with either an oral steroid or antibiotic dispensing within five days of the visit.24,25 The first hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of COPD during follow-up was used to identify COPD-related hospitalizations.
Exposure
Medication exposure was measured as a time-varying covariate during follow-up. Exposure was measured as the presence of a prescription for a respiratory medication in the 180 day period prior to each day of the follow-up period. Specifically, an individual’s medication exposure was redefined each time there was an event during follow-up and the individual remained at risk. Exposure was defined using the 180-day period prior to the day of the event. We identified use of: inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), ipratropium bromide (IPRA), long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), short-acting beta-agonists (SABA), theophylline (THEO) and tiotropium (TIO). For each exposure day we defined medication regimens based on the combination of medication used during that period. Time-varying exposure allowed for different medication regimens to be attributed to the same individual.
Short-acting beta-agonists were not included in regimen definitions because of their nearly universal use by patients in the cohort. There were 32 possible medication regimens for exposure during follow-up, which includes exposure to only short-acting beta-agonists or no respiratory medication. Because of relatively small amounts of exposure in some regimens, we collapsed regimens with less than 1% of exposure time during follow-up. This resulted in 17 medication regimens included in the analysis.
Covariates
We defined covariates from the 12 months preceding the index date. Demographic characteristics, healthcare utilization and co-existing conditions were determined from inpatient and outpatient data. For healthcare utilization, we measured COPD-related and non-COPD healthcare. We measured use of respiratory and other medications that preceded the medication switch. Other important covariates included distance to the nearest VA hospital and level of prescription medication co-payment.26
Propensity Score
We calculated propensity scores to balance groups on baseline characteristics in an effort to reduce concerns related to confounding by indication and other biases that may exist.27-33 Using baseline characteristics as covariates, we estimated the likelihood of switching to tiotropium only in the contemporary cohort because tiotropium was not available in the historic cohort and the probability of switching to tiotropium was zero. The propensity score model was fit for the initial medication (i.e. switch to ICS+LABA or switch to tiotropium) and then applied to both cohorts for each individual. Because of differences in the distribution of propensity scores between groups, only those with a propensity score between 0.1 and 0.4 were included.
Analysis
Analyses were done separately for each outcome. We used Cox Proportional Hazards models, controlling for propensity score, to examine the association between medication regimen exposure and risk of event. We used inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting beta-agonist group from the period in which tiotropium was not available (historic controls) as the reference group. We conducted several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact on study results. First, we used non-tiotropium patients from both historic and contemporary cohorts. Second, only non-tiotropium patients from the contemporary cohort were used as controls. Third, the timeframe for identifying exposure was reduced to 90 days from 180 days in the base case. Fourth, follow-up was stopped after 365 days to evaluate results over a one-year period. Fifth, patients were censored when they had a medication change from their index medication regimen. Sixth, we controlled for baseline cardiovascular medication use in regression models. Seventh, patients with a hospitalization during baseline were excluded in an attempt to focus on a more homogeneous patient population. Eighth, treatments were compared among patients with propensity scores from 0.4 to 0.7. Analyses were conducted with Stata/MP 10.0 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX USA) and SAS 9.2 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC USA).
Results
We identified 135,422 patients for inclusion, of which 42,090 were included in the base case. There were 38,850 patients that switched to a regimen that included inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists in the historic cohort, while 3,240 switched to a regimen that included tiotropium. The average age in both groups was around 70 years and nearly 98% were male (Table 1). Those that switched to tiotropium had more COPD exacerbations at baseline and had a slightly larger percentage with 3 or more outpatient visits in the preceding 12 months.
During follow-up there were more than 17.1 million person-days of medication exposure. The most commonly used regimen was inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists plus ipratropium (Table 2). This regimen was used during slightly more than 50% of exposure days and was used by 76% of patients at some point during follow-up. The reference regimen of inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists was used by 20.5% of the cohort over nearly one million person-days of exposure. Of the tiotropium regimens, the most frequently used regimen was tiotropium in combination with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists which was used in 2.4% of the exposure days and by 6.4% of the overall group. The second most commonly used regimen with tiotropium was tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists plus ipratropium (1.7% of exposure days).
For each outcome, the crude rate was higher in the tiotropium exposed group than in the non-tiotropium groups. The crude mortality rate was 14.6 per 100 person-years in the tiotropium group and 11.7 per 100 person-years in the non-tiotropium group (Table 3). The difference equates to a rate ratio of 1.25 for those switched to a tiotropium regimen relative to those not switched to tiotropium. Similar rate ratios were seen for exacerbation and hospitalization rates between groups. When accounting for differences in propensity score between treatment regimens, it was clear there was heterogeneity in the association between the outcomes and regimens that contained tiotropium. The adjusted hazard ratio for combination tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists showed a 40% reduction in mortality risk (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45, 0.79) compared to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists (Table 4). This was in contrast to tiotropium in combination with two other respiratory medications, excluding inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists, (e.g. TIO+IPRA+ICS, TIO+LABA+IPRA, TIO+THEO+IPRA, etc.) where there was an increased risk of mortality (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06, 1.81). The most common combinations in this group were tiotropium plus ipratropium plus inhaled corticosteroids and tiotropium plus ipratropium plus long-acting beta-agonists which contributed 84% of the exposure days in this group. The combination of tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists plus ipratropium was associated with a 36% increase in risk of death compared to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists.
For the most part, findings for exacerbations and hospitalizations were similar to mortality. For example, tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists was consistently associated with a reduced risk of events. For exacerbations there was a 16% reduction in risk (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79, 0.97) while there was a 22% reduction (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62, 0.89) for COPD-related hospitalizations. The exception to the consistent results was regimens that included tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists plus ipratropium where there was no significant association between exacerbations and hospitalizations compared to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists.
The reduced risk associated with tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists was consistently seen in each sensitivity analysis for all three outcomes (Figure 1). Only in the analysis in which patients with baseline hospitalizations were excluded did we not find a significant protective effect for combination tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists across each outcome. The sensitivity analysis in which patients were censored at the point of a medication switch resulted in a change in the direction of the association observed with tiotropium plus two other medications and tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists plus ipratropium. In this analysis, these regimens were associated with a protective effect for mortality relative to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists while in the base case and all of the other sensitivity analyses they were associated with an increased risk of mortality.
Discussion
This study contributes evidence on the safety and comparative effectiveness of tiotropium for treatment of COPD for patient populations that have not previously been examined, using "real world" data. In this analysis, we found regimens that included tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists in combination were associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, COPD exacerbations and COPD hospitalizations compared to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. Other three combination regimens that included tiotropium and the four combination regimen that included tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists plus ipratropium were associated with increased mortality risk.
Results from our study are similar to those reported from UPLIFT. This was a four year, multinational, randomized controlled trial that compared tiotropium to placebo while allowing the use of other COPD medications during the study period.34 Nearly 6,000 patients were enrolled and the results showed reduced rates of exacerbations (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81, 0.91) and improvements in respiratory-related quality of life. The reduced rate of exacerbations was similar to the 16% reduction we observed in this analysis for the combination of tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. In UPLIFT tiotropium was associated with an 11% reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79, 1.02), which was not statistically significant, when the four-year + 30 day period was used, while tiotropium was associated with a 13% reduction in mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79, 0.99) when the analysis was limited to the four year study period. The effect in UPLIFT are substantially lower than the decreased risk of mortality we observed in patients on tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. Importantly our comparison of tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists relative to inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists is probably most similar to the comparisons in UPLIFT given that nearly three out of four patients reported using inhaled corticosteroids (74%) or long-acting beta-agonists (72%) during the study period. The regimens with ipratropium evaluated in our analysis were not included in UPLIFT as use of short-acting anticholinergics was prohibited except if deemed medically necessary to treat an acute exacerbation.
Our study suggests there is heterogeneity in the effects observed for treatment regimens that included tiotropium. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, our reference group was combination inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. The addition of tiotropium to medication regimens that are less effective than inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists may not improve overall outcomes. Second, medications used in combination with tiotropium may be associated with increased risks and therefore regimens that included these medications and tiotropium may be associated with an elevated risk compared to the reference group (e.g., concurrent use of short-acting anticholinergics). Finally, use of more medications may be indicative of more severe disease and even though we controlled for markers of disease severity differences may remain between groups.
While our findings did not show harm associated with tiotropium in several regimens, it does not alleviate all potential concerns regarding tiotropium safety. This is particularly true if risks reported for ipratropium represent a class effect for anticholinergic medications. If this is the case, our study design is not optimal for identifying risks associated with tiotropium, while we identify new tiotropium users many patients had previously used ipratropium which may limit our ability in identifying adverse effects of anticholinergics.35 The same is true for UPLIFT, where nearly 50% of patients enrolled used anticholinergics prior to beginning the study. Thus, there is still need to evaluate tiotropium safety in patient populations who are treatment naïve to anticholinergic medications.
One important consideration in interpreting these results is whether we have adequately controlled for severity differences. As Strom describes, a weakness of comparative effectiveness studies using observational data is that, absent randomization, we cannot be certain there were not other differences between groups, unmeasured and uncontrolled, creating a selection bias.36 Our study suffers from an inability to differentiate severity using a clinical marker of disease. In addition, the VA instituted criteria for use of tiotropium in patients with COPD that restricted use of the medication. Because of concerns about confounding by indication, we felt it was important to find a comparable group of patients in order to minimize differences in disease severity and further adjust for differences using propensity scores. Therefore, we selected a cohort from a period when tiotropium was not available and where combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists were used as the highest step in COPD treatment. Estimation of the propensity to use tiotropium showed nearly one-third of tiotropium users we identified were different from those who switched to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. As a result, we limited our cohort to those with similar propensity scores so groups of patients with similar baseline characteristics were compared. Limiting our sample to this group strengthens the internal validity of the findings, but at the expense of generalizability, as the findings may not apply to all users of tiotropium and are most applicable to males given that 98% of the population was male.
While taking advantage of a timeframe in which tiotropium was not available may help balance groups, it also introduces limitations associated with historic controls. Historic controls can raise concerns about secular trends impacting findings, which may be particularly true when a mortality benefit is found in a more recent cohort as advances in medical technology may contribute to these differences. However, the time period in which the groups are identified is only two years apart which may limit some of the secular concerns. Importantly, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which we used controls from both periods as well as controls from only the current period and the results were consistent across groups. The control group from the same period that the tiotropium users were selected from had similar baseline characteristics to the tiotropium patients when the sample was restricted by propensity score. Other limitations of the analysis are that we are unable to capture out of system use; however we do not expect out of system use to be differential between exposure groups would bias results toward the null. We are also unable to measure other important covariates like smoking status which may lead to unmeasured confounding in the analysis.
The strength of the present study is that, compared with a randomized trial, we evaluated effects of exposure to respiratory-related drugs in real-life clinical practice. Many combinations of medications were reported that have not previously been investigated. However, a subset of comparisons was of primary relevance, specifically the referent combination (inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists) compared to tiotropium plus inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta-agonists. Unlike placebo controlled trials, this study provides evidence as to the comparative effectiveness of treatments in COPD which are important for patients and providers when making treatment decisions in an effort to tailor therapies that are likely to optimize outcomes. Our findings show, when used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, tiotropium was associated with a decreased risk of mortality, COPD exacerbations, and COPD hospitalizations compared to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Importantly, there is the need for additional information on the comparative effectiveness of COPD treatment regimens so that patients and providers can make informed treatment decisions by weighing the harms and benefits of each of the medications and medication regimens from direct comparisons.

Introduction
When comparing grid connected, diesel powered and solar water pumps different parameters have to be taken into account.
For the decision which energy source the water pumping system should run on, externalities, which are mainly of ecological nature (see this energypedia article), are almost never taken into account. Therefore ecological benefits are commonly not decision-relevant for farmers. The reason could be that external effects and environmental consequences of groundwater pumping are harder to observe than private economic costs and benefits. Even though monetization of external costs could be a valuable step, farmers in developing countries – where by far the highest share of irrigated area is located [1] – do very often not have the freedom to care about environmental arguments which is a plausible reaction when struggling with the non-availability of sufficient food.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Grid Connected Systems
Disadvantages
Economic Aspects
Under economic aspects the grid connected solution is an alternative which can be taken into account only under the precondition that a grid connection is already available before the water pumping project is planned. If that is not the case, like in large parts of the world, then the grid connected water pumping system won’t be feasible. In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 600 million people across almost 50 countries have no access to electricity and in India this number is around 300 million [2]. Also in remote areas in rich countries like the US, an extension of the power supply is either too expensive or not feasible because of natural conditions. Meah et al. [3] state that the cost of extending a distribution line run from 10,000 USD to 16,000 USD per km. This is clearly too much to pay for a farmer or any other end-user especially considering that not only the building costs have to be covered but also the maintenance of the line has to be ensured. People who benefit from remote water pumping could not pay for these costs either [4].
In addition to the costs of setting up and maintaining a distribution line, comes the problem of an unreliable grid in many countries. In western and southern India for instance – the country with the largest irrigated area (39 million hectares) [5] – the government has subsidized electricity for irrigation purposes. It is available at very low (one or two cents per kWh) to no cost and therefore provided irregularly during off-peak periods. This provision of heavily subsidized electricity leads to groundwater over-pumping [6][7]. The off-peak periods are usually during night time, when it is dangerous and unproductive to be outside on the fields. The irregular access to energy forces the farmers to grow low value crops that can tolerate infrequent water supplies keeping them financially dependent on the subsidy. Besides, the utilities make no money in this distorted market and have no incentive to approve electric water pumping applications leading to a pent-up demand. Also no incentive to increase the efficiency of electric pumps is given with the effect that electric pumps show an efficiency range of 15-20%. This is highly wasteful knowing that 75% efficiency is attainable [7].
Environmental and Social Aspects
From an environmental point of view, grid driven water pumps can only be sustainable, if the electricity is produced with as little as possible emissions because the emissions of various gasses emitted by combustion of fossil energy sources like coal is related to climate change as well as health hazards [8]. Staying with the example of India, this is not the case. The largest share of electricity production is covered by coal (60%) and only 15% by hydropower [9]. In the International Energy Outlook 2016, coal has also worldwide the largest share of electricity production (40% in 2012). In the report’s reference projection it won’t be until 2040 that renewable generation surpasses coal as the source of electricity generation with the highest share [10].
Advantages
On the other hand grid connection allows for the possibility to sell excess energy produced by stand-alone systems back to the grid. This is a very effective method to minimise water pumping and use energy efficiently. Combining a solar pump with grid connection would be an ideal concept to counteract groundwater over-exploitation [6]. The precondition of an already existing grid connection is of important because of the above mentioned high costs of extending the distribution line.
Conclusion
In conclusion it can be stated that grid connected water pumps are only a suitable option if first, a grid connection already exists at the water pumping installation side, second, the electricity supply via the grid is stable and third the energy supplying the grid is mainly if not entirely produced out of renewables. As outlined these conditions won’t be met either easily or soon and therefore alternative systems of power generation are needed.
Comparison of Solar Powered and Diesel Powered Water Pumping Systems
Stand-alone systems like solar and diesel can improve rural electrification [8] and in the following these two systems are compared.
The only difference between a diesel and a solar powered system is the source of energy that is utilized. Diesel pumping systems use an electric generator and a PV system includes solar panels. The other system components stay the same: pump, controller/inverter, power cables, draw down pipes and accessories [3]. For that reason the source of power generation is decisive when comparing both options.
The following table gives an overview of advantages and disadvantages of both, solar powered and diesel driven systems. Except for the disadvantage of noise and air pollution from diesel pumps, the other factors are of certain economic nature.
Type
Advantages
Disadvantages
PV pump Unattended operation High investment costs
Low maintenance costs Water storage is required (cloudy periods, night)
Long lifetime (low average yearly costs) Repair often requires skilled technicians
Diesel pump Fast and easy installation Fuel supplies erratic and expensive (high operational costs)
Low investment costs
High maintenance costs
Short life expectancy
Noise and air pollution
Source: Author based on Abu-Aligah (2011)[11]
It becomes clear that the advantages of the PV pump are the disadvantages of the diesel pump and vice versa. Diesel pumps require low initial investment costs but have high operation and maintenance costs. The investment costs of solar pumps are high but these pumps do not require a lot of maintenance and operational costs are zero as PV runs on solar.
Private Economic Costs
The private economic costs (external costs and benefits are not included) of solar water pumping systems can compete with diesel powered systems when the solar system is adequately designed and operational and maintenance costs are considered [12]. According to Al-Smairan (2012) [4] the total life cycle cost of a solar pumping system is almost three times less than the life cycle cost of a diesel pumping system. The life cycle costs include investment costs, operation and maintenance costs along the system’s life time. And Chandel et al. (2015) [13] state that “The overall upfront cost, operation and maintenance cost, and replacement of a diesel pump are 2–4 times higher than a solar photovoltaic (PV) pump”.
The decisive cost factor of a solar water pumping system remains the high investment cost of the panels [4] even though the price of solar panels is declining in recent years [4][14]. Apart from pump or controller failures solar modules normally only need cleaning, which can be done by unskilled labour. This keeps the maintenance costs low or even for free [11][3]. Diesel based systems on the other hand require fuel and despite short-term fluctuations fuel prices are increasing in the long term [11] and so do operational costs for diesel pumps. Also maintenance costs of diesel engines are significantly bigger resulting in the fact that solar water pumping systems are cheaper in the long run [4].
Reliability and Efficiency
According to Abu-Aligah (2011) [11] solar powered systems are more reliable than diesel engines, which is evident in field where thousands of rusting diesel engines lie unused. The reliability of solar systems requires sunlight and a solar water pump is hence not working during cloudy and foggy days [15].
Abu-Aligah (2011) [11] provides two solutions to counteract this problem:
First, batteries can be coupled to the system. These systems are called battery-coupled systems. The electricity produced during daylight hours charges the batteries and the pump can be used whenever water is needed. The downside of this solution is that the efficiency of the overall system can be reduced. The voltage supplied by the PV panels during maximum sunlight conditions can be higher by one to four volts than the voltage supplied by the batteries and because the operating voltage is determined by the batteries, the system’s efficiency is reduced in this situation. An appropriate pump controller which boosts the battery voltage supplied to the pump can minimize this reduced efficiency.
Second, water storage possibilities can be attached to the system. These systems are direct-coupled and they are designed to only pump during the day. Water can be stored in tanks which can be elevated in order to gravity-feed the irrigation system. During sunny days the storage tanks are filled with water which can then be used during the night or cloudy days. The capacity of the water storage depends on climate and pattern of water usage. Drawbacks of this solution are evaporation losses, if the storage tanks are open, the additional costs of the water tanks and the possibility that the water in the tanks might freeze during cold weather. Nevertheless most PV pumping systems use this solution of storing water in tanks or reservoirs.
The amount of water pumped with a direct-coupled solar pumping system totally depends on the amount of sunlight and the type of pump. The efficiency of a solar pump is not steady and changes throughout the day with the intensity of the sun and the angle the sunlight hits the PV panels. During low-light periods (in the morning and late afternoon) the efficiency can drop by 25% or more and during cloudy days the pump efficiency will be even less. Under optimum sunlight conditions (on sunny days during midday) the solar powered pump works near 100% of efficiency [11]. Diesel powered pumps on the other hand can work continuously at certain efficiency if the diesel fuel supply is ensured. In most circumstances an efficiency of 70% to 80% should be achievable for diesel pumps [16].
Environmental and Human Health Impacts
When comparing the environmental impact of a PV and a diesel powered pumping system, one has to take into account a product’s whole life cycle – from production to recycling. The Life Cycle Assessment by Armanuos et al. (2016) [17] shows that PV pumping systems have a way smaller negative impact on natural resources depletion, human health, climate change and ecosystem quality that diesel powered ones. Nevertheless solar powered irrigation systems do still have a negative impact on these four categories.
The negative impacts of solar systems depend on the kind of solar panels that are used and on the recycling infrastructure. Silicon based photovoltaic solar panels have a very much higher negative environmental impact than organic ones. Organic solar photovoltaic (OPV) panels are on the other hand less efficient and have a shorter life time than silicon PVs. The potential of increasing the ecological advantage of solar pumping systems compared to diesel powered pumping systems even further lies in increasing the efficiency and lifetime of OPVs and in the implementing of full-scale silicon recycling processes, which are right now not existing [18].
Summary
When comparing solar pumps with other sources of energy one has to keep several factors in mind. Depending on for instance the location but also e.g. market distortions like subsidies on electricity and diesel which would decrease the costs of these options, the following advantages and disadvantages of SPIS can be summarised.
Advantages of Solar Powered Irrigation Systems (SPIS)
In remote areas with high solar radiation solar pumps have proven to be cost effective and a dependable method for water pumping [4][19]. At the end of remote supply chains grid connection is not available and an extension of the power supply system would be too expensive. The world’s poorest might also not be able to afford diesel as world demand increases and so do fuel prices [11][4]. In addition the mere availability of fuel could already be a problem in remote areas. In addition of providing water, SPIS also increase rural electrification rates in general which is a major challenge in large parts of the world [2].
To reduce the dependency on fossil fuels or coal based electricity is also beneficiary in less remote areas. First, for environmental and health reasons as solar panels are less environmental unfriendly and do not create noise and create air pollution [13].
The cost effectiveness of SPIS is given when considering the whole (and longer) life span of the solar pumping system with a higher reliability than diesel based ones [4][13][12].
High solar radiation and the need to irrigate crops very often go together which can be derived from the fact that developing countries have the highest share in irrigated areas [1].
Disadvantages of Solar Powered Irrigation Systems (SPIS)
Solar radiation strongly depends on the latitude and climate [4]. There are ways (battery, water tank) to counteract the problem of reduced efficiency when insulation decreases but they come with reduced system efficiency and higher costs [11].
The increasing costs of the system are a problem when considering the already high investment costs which are very often the relevant obstacle of investing in SPIS [11][4][19].
Conclusion
Solar powered irrigation systems show several advantages over electric and diesel based systems as outlined above and their utilisation is a valuablestep towards more sustainability in irrigation practices. Nevertheless, the problem ofgroundwater depletion cannot be overcome by SPIS. As outlined in this energypedia article, groundwater preserving water pumping obligatory requires regulation, enforcement of the rules and monitoring.

Description:
"Sufis, Shi‘ites and Shahs: The Great Shrines of Iran 1500-1650" - Dr. Sheila Canby, Curator of Islamic Collections at the British Museum, will discuss the Ardabil Shrine, the dynastic heart of the Safavid Dynasty, and two other major shrines, the Shrine of Imam Riza in Mashhad and the Shrine of Fatimeh Ma`sumeh in Qum. The gifts and renovations of the Safavid shahs to the shrines bear witness to the important role of these shrines in establishing Shiism as the state religion of Iran and the Safavid shahs as its protectors. This lecture is presented in partnership with His Highness Prince Aga Khan Shia Imami Ismaili Council for Northern Texas.

The Georgia Guidestones may be the most enigmatic monument in the US: huge slabs of granite, inscribed with directions for rebuilding civilization after the apocalypse. Only one man knows who created them—and he’s not talking.

The strangest monument in America looms over a barren knoll in northeastern Georgia. Five massive slabs of polished granite rise out of the earth in a star pattern. The rocks are each 16 feet tall, with four of them weighing more than 20 tons apiece. Together they support a 25,000-pound capstone. Approaching the edifice, it’s hard not to think immediately of England’s Stonehenge or possibly the ominous monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey . Built in 1980, these pale gray rocks are quietly awaiting the end of the world as we know it.
Called the Georgia Guidestones, the monument is a mystery—nobody knows exactly who commissioned it or why. The only clues to its origin are on a nearby plaque on the ground—which gives the dimensions and explains a series of intricate notches and holes that correspond to the movements of the sun and stars—and the "guides" themselves, directives carved into the rocks. These instructions appear in eight languages ranging from English to Swahili and reflect a peculiar New Age ideology. Some are vaguely eugenic (GUIDE REPRODUCTION WISELY—IMPROVING FITNESS AND DIVERSITY); others prescribe standard-issue hippie mysticism (PRIZE TRUTH—BEAUTY—LOVE—SEEKING HARMONY WITH THE INFINITE).
What’s most widely agreed upon—based on the evidence available—is that the Guidestones are meant to instruct the dazed survivors of some impending apocalypse as they attempt to reconstitute civilization. Not everyone is comfortable with this notion. A few days before I visited, the stones had been splattered with polyurethane and spray-painted with graffiti, including slogans like "Death to the new world order." This defacement was the first serious act of vandalism in the Guidestones’ history, but it was hardly the first objection to their existence. In fact, for more than three decades this uncanny structure in the heart of the Bible Belt has been generating responses that range from enchantment to horror. Supporters (notable among them Yoko Ono) have praised the messages as a stirring call to rational thinking, akin to Thomas Paine’s The Age of Reason . Opponents have attacked them as the Ten Commandments of the Antichrist.
Whoever the anonymous architects of the Guidestones were, they knew what they were doing: The monument is a highly engineered structure that flawlessly tracks the sun. It also manages to engender endless fascination, thanks to a carefully orchestrated aura of mystery. And the stones have attracted plenty of devotees to defend against folks who would like them destroyed. Clearly, whoever had the monument placed here understood one thing very well: People prize what they don’t understand at least as much as what they do.
The story of the Georgia Guidestones began on a Friday afternoon in June 1979, when an elegant gray-haired gentleman showed up in Elbert County, made his way to the offices of Elberton Granite Finishing, and introduced himself as Robert C. Christian. He claimed to represent "a small group of loyal Americans" who had been planning the installation of an unusually large and complex stone monument. Christian had come to Elberton—the county seat and the granite capital of the world—because he believed its quarries produced the finest stone on the planet.
Joe Fendley, Elberton Granite’s president, nodded absently, distracted by the rush to complete his weekly payroll. But when Christian began to describe the monument he had in mind, Fendley stopped what he was doing. Not only was the man asking for stones larger than any that had been quarried in the county, he also wanted them cut, finished, and assembled into some kind of enormous astronomical instrument.
What in the world would it be for? Fendley asked. Christian explained that the structure he had in mind would serve as a compass, calendar, and clock. It would also need to be engraved with a set of guides written in eight of the world’s major languages. And it had to be capable of withstanding the most catastrophic events, so that the shattered remnants of humanity would be able to use those guides to reestablish a better civilization than the one that was about to destroy itself.
MONUMENTAL PRECISION
Built to survive the apocalypse, the Georgia Guidestones are not merely instructions for the future—the massive granite slabs also function as a clock, calendar, and compass.
The monument sits at the highest point in Elbert County and is oriented to track the sun’s east-west migration year-round.

Fendley is now deceased, but shortly after the Guidestones went up, an Atlanta television reporter asked what he was thinking when he first heard Christian’s plan. "I was thinking, ‘I got a nut in here now. How am I going get him out?’" Fendley said. He attempted to discourage the man by quoting him a price several times higher than for any project commissioned there before. The job would require special tools, heavy equipment, and paid consultants, Fendley explained. But Christian merely nodded and asked how long it would take. Fendley didn’t rightly know—six months, at least. He wouldn’t be able to even consider such an undertaking, he added, until he knew it could be paid for. When Christian asked whether there was a banker in town he considered trustworthy, Fendley saw his chance to unload the strange man and sent him to look for Wyatt Martin, president of the Granite City Bank.
The tall and courtly Martin—the only man in Elberton besides Fendley known to have met R. C. Christian face-to-face—is now 78. "Fendley called me and said, ‘A kook over here wants some kind of crazy monument,’" Martin says. "But when this fella showed up he was wearing a very nice, expensive suit, which made me take him a little more seriously. And he was well-spoken, obviously an educated person." Martin was naturally taken aback when the man told him straight out that R. C. Christian was a pseudonym. He added that his group had been planning this secretly for 20 years and wanted to remain anonymous forever. "And when he told me what it was he and this group wanted to do, I just about fell over," Martin says. "I told him, ‘I believe you’d be just as well off to take the money and throw it out in the street into the gutters.’ He just sort of looked at me and shook his head, like he felt kinda sorry for me, and said, ‘You don’t understand.’"
Martin led Christian down the street to the town square, where the city had commissioned a towering Bicentennial Memorial Fountain, which included a ring of 13 granite panels, each roughly 2 by 3 feet, signifying the original colonies. "I told him that was about the biggest project ever undertaken around here, and it was nothing compared to what he was talking about," Martin says. "That didn’t seem to bother him at all." Promising to return on Monday, the man went off to charter a plane and spend the weekend scouting locations from the air. "By then I half believed him," Martin says.
When Christian came back to the bank Monday, Martin explained that he could not proceed unless he could verify the man’s true identity and "get some assurance you can pay for this thing." Eventually, the two negotiated an agreement: Christian would reveal his real name on the condition that Martin promise to serve as his sole intermediary, sign a confidentiality agreement pledging never to disclose the information to another living soul, and agree to destroy all documents and records related to the project when it was finished. "He said he was going to send the money from different banks across the country," Martin says, "because he wanted to make sure it couldn’t be traced. He made it clear that he was very serious about secrecy."
Before leaving town, Christian met again with Fendley and presented the contractor with a shoe box containing a wooden model of the monument he wanted, plus 10 or so pages of detailed specifications. Fendley accepted the model and instructions but remained skeptical until Martin phoned the following Friday to say he had just received a $10,000 deposit. After that, Fendley stopped questioning and started working. "My daddy loved a challenge," says Fendley’s daughter, Melissa Fendley Caruso, "and he said this was the most challenging project in the history of Elbert County."

Construction of the Guidestones got under way later that summer. Fendley’s company lovingly documented the progress of the work in hundreds of photographs. Jackhammers were used to gouge 114 feet into the rock at Pyramid Quarry, searching for hunks of granite big enough to yield the final stones. Fendley and his crew held their breath when the first 28-ton slab was lifted to the surface, wondering if their derricks would buckle under the weight. A special burner (essentially a narrowly focused rocket motor used to cut and finish large blocks of granite) was trucked to Elberton to clean and size the stones, and a pair of master stonecutters was hired to smooth them.
Fendley and Martin helped Christian find a suitable site for the Guidestones in Elbert County: a flat-topped hill rising above the pastures of the Double 7 Farms, with vistas in all directions. For $5,000, owner Wayne Mullinex signed over a 5-acre plot. In addition to the payment, Christian granted lifetime cattle-grazing rights to Mullinex and his children, and Mullinex’s construction company got to lay the foundation for the Guidestones.
With the purchase of the land, the Guidestones’ future was set. Christian said good-bye to Fendley at the granite company office, adding, "You’ll never see me again." Christian then turned and walked out the door—without so much as a handshake.
From then on, Christian communicated solely through Martin, writing a few weeks later to ask that ownership of the land and monument be transferred to Elbert County, which still holds it. Christian reasoned that civic pride would protect it over time. "All of Mr. Christian’s correspondence came from different cities around the country," Martin says. "He never sent anything from the same place twice."

The astrological specifications for the Guidestones were so complex that Fendley had to retain the services of an astronomer from the University of Georgia to help implement the design. The four outer stones were to be oriented based on the limits of the sun’s yearly migration. The center column needed two precisely calibrated features: a hole through which the North Star would be visible at all times, and a slot that was to align with the position of the rising sun during the solstices and equinoxes. The principal component of the capstone was a 7\8-inch aperture through which a beam of sunlight would pass at noon each day, shining on the center stone to indicate the day of the year.
The main feature of the monument, though, would be the 10 dictates carved into both faces of the outer stones, in eight languages: English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, and Swahili. A mission statement of sorts (LET THESE BE GUIDESTONES TO AN AGE OF REASON) was also to be engraved on the sides of the capstone in Egyptian hieroglyphics, classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian cuneiform. The United Nations provided some of the translations (including those for the dead languages), which were stenciled onto the stones and etched with a sandblaster.
By early 1980, a bulldozer was scraping the Double 7 hilltop to bedrock, where five granite slabs serving as a foundation were laid out in a paddle-wheel design. A 100-foot-tall crane was used to lift the stones into place. Each of the outer rocks was 16 feet 4 inches high, 6 feet 6 inches wide, and 1 foot 7 inches thick. The center column was the same (except only half the width), and the capstone measured 9 feet 8 inches long, 6 feet 6 inches wide, and 1 foot 7 inches thick. Including the foundation stones, the monument’s total weight was almost 240,000 pounds. Covered with sheets of black plastic in preparation for an unveiling on the vernal equinox, the Guidestones towered over the cattle that continued to graze beneath it at the approach of winter’s end.
The monument ignited controversy before it was even finished. The first rumor began among members of the Elberton Granite Association, jealous of the attention being showered on one of their own: Fendley was behind the whole thing, they said, aided by his friend Martin, the banker. The gossip became so poisonous that the two men agreed to take a lie detector test at the Elberton Civic Center. The scandal withered when The Elberton Star reported that they had both passed convincingly, but the publicity brought a new wave of complaints. As word of what was being inscribed spread, Martin recalls, even people he considered friends asked him why he was doing the devil’s work. A local minister, James Travenstead, predicted that "occult groups" would flock to the Guidestones, warning that "someday a sacrifice will take place here." Those inclined to agree were hardly discouraged by Charlie Clamp, the sandblaster charged with carving each of the 4,000-plus characters on the stones: During the hundreds of hours he spent etching the guides, Clamp said, he had been constantly distracted by "strange music and disjointed voices."
The team that built the Guidestones didn’t know who was financing the project—just that it was the biggest monument in county history. Local banker Wyatt Martin inspects the English lettering with sandblaster Charlie Clamp before the 1980 unveiling.

The unveiling on March 22, 1980, was a community celebration. Congressmember Doug Barnard, whose district contained Elberton, addressed a crowd of 400 that flowed down the hillside and included television news crews from Atlanta. Soon Joe Fendley was the most famous Elbertonian since Daniel Tucker, the 18th-century minister memorialized in the folk song "Old Dan Tucker." Bounded by the Savannah and Broad rivers but miles from the nearest interstate—"as rural as rural can be," in the words of current Star publisher Gary Jones—Elberton was suddenly a tourist destination, with visitors from all over the world showing up to see the Guidestones. "We’d have people from Japan and China and India and everywhere wanting to go up and see the monument," Martin says. And Fendley’s boast that he had "put Elberton on the map" was affirmed literally in spring 2005, when National Geographic Traveler listed the Guidestones as a feature in its Geotourism MapGuide to Appalachia.
But many who read what was written on the stones were unsettled. Guide number one was, of course, the real stopper: MAINTAIN HUMANITY UNDER 500,000,000 IN PERPETUAL BALANCE WITH NATURE. There were already 4.5 billion people on the planet, meaning eight out of nine had to go (today it would be closer to 12 out of 13). This instruction was echoed and expanded by tenet number two: GUIDE REPRODUCTION WISELY—IMPROVING FITNESS AND DIVERSITY. It didn’t take a great deal of imagination to draw an analogy to the practices of, among others, the Nazis. Guide number three instructed readers to unite humanity with a living new language. This sent a shiver up the spine of local ministers who knew that the Book of Revelations warned of a common tongue and a one-world government as the accomplishments of the Antichrist. Guide number four—RULE PASSION—FAITH—TRADITION—AND ALL THINGS WITH TEMPERED REASON—was similarly threatening to Christians committed to the primacy of faith over all. The last six guides were homiletic by comparison. PROTECT PEOPLE AND NATIONS WITH FAIR LAWS AND JUST COURTS. LET ALL NATIONS RULE INTERNALLY RESOLVING EXTERNAL DISPUTES IN A WORLD COURT. AVOID PETTY LAWS AND USELESS OFFICIALS. BALANCE PERSONAL RIGHTS WITH SOCIAL DUTIES. PRIZE TRUTH—BEAUTY—LOVE—SEEKING HARMONY WITH THE INFINITE. BE NOT A CANCER ON THE EARTH—LEAVE ROOM FOR NATURE—LEAVE ROOM FOR NATURE.
Even as locals debated the relative merits of these commandments, the dire predictions of Travenstead seemed to be coming true. Within a few months, a coven of witches from Atlanta adopted the Guidestones as their home away from home, making weekend pilgrimages to Elberton to stage various pagan rites ("dancing and chanting and all that kind of thing," Martin says) and at least one warlock-witch marriage ceremony. No humans were sacrificed on the altar of the stones, but there are rumors that several chickens were beheaded. A 1981 article in the monthly magazine UFO Report cited Naunie Batchelder (identified in the story as "a noted Atlanta psychic") as predicting that the true purpose of the guides would be revealed "within the next 30 years." Viewed from directly overhead, the Guidestones formed an X, the piece in UFO Report observed, making for a perfect landing site.
Visitors kept coming, but after several failed investigations into the identity of R. C. Christian, the media lost interest. Curiosity flared again briefly in 1993, when Yoko Ono contributed a track called "Georgia Stone" to a tribute album for avant-garde composer John Cage, with Ono chanting the 10th and final guide nearly verbatim: "Be not a cancer on Earth—leave room for nature—leave room for nature." A decade later, however, when comedienne Roseanne Barr tried to work a bit on the Guidestones into her comeback tour, nobody seemed to care.
Christian kept in touch with Martin, writing the banker so regularly that they became pen pals. Occasionally, Christian would call from a pay phone at the Atlanta airport to say he was in the area, and the two would rendezvous for dinner in the college town of Athens, a 40-mile drive west of Elberton. By this time, Martin no longer questioned Christian’s secrecy. The older man had successfully deflected Martin’s curiosity when the two first met, by quoting Henry James’ observations of Stonehenge: "You may put a hundred questions to these rough-hewn giants as they bend in grim contemplation of their fallen companions, but your curiosity falls dead in the vast sunny stillness that enshrouds them." Christian "never would tell me a thing about this group he belonged to," Martin says. The banker received his last letter from Christian right around the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and assumes the man—who would have been in his mid-eighties—has since passed away.

The mysterious story of R. C. Christian and the absence of information about the true meaning of the Guidestones was bound to become an irresistible draw for conspiracy theorists and "investigators" of all kinds. Not surprisingly, three decades later there is no shortage of observers rushing to fill the void with all sorts of explanations.
Among them is an activist named Mark Dice, author of a book called The Resistance Manifesto . In 2005, Dice (who was using a pseudonym of his own—"John Conner"—appropriated from the Terminator franchise’s main character) began to demand that the Guidestones be "smashed into a million pieces." He claims that the monument has "a deep Satanic origin," a stance that has earned him plenty of coverage, both in print and on the Web. According to Dice, Christian was a high-ranking member of "a Luciferian secret society" at the forefront of the New World Order. "The elite are planning to develop successful life-extension technology in the next few decades that will nearly stop the aging process," Dice says, "and they fear that with the current population of Earth so high, the masses will be using resources that the elite want for themselves. The Guidestones are the New World Order’s Ten Commandments. They’re also a way for the elite to get a laugh at the expense of the uninformed masses, as their agenda stands as clear as day and the zombies don’t even notice it."
Ironically, Dice’s message has mainly produced greater publicity for the Guidestones. This, in turn, has brought fresh visitors to the monument and made Elbert County officials even less inclined to remove the area’s only major tourist attraction.
Phyllis Brooks, who runs the Elbert County Chamber of Commerce, pronounced herself aghast last November when the Guidestones were attacked by vandals for the first time ever. While Dice denies any involvement in the assault, he seems to have inspired it: Spray-painted on the stones were messages like "Jesus will beat u satanist" and "No one world government." Other defacements asserted that the Council on Foreign Relations is "ran by the devil," that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job, and that President Obama is a Muslim. The vandals also splashed the Guidestones with polyurethane, which is much more difficult to remove than paint. Despite the graffiti’s alignment with his views, Dice says he disapproves of the acts. "A lot of people were glad such a thing happened and saw it as standing up against the New World Order," Dice says, "while others who are unhappy with the stones saw the actions as counterproductive and inappropriate."
Martin winces every time he hears Dice’s "Luciferian secret society" take on the Guidestones. But while he disagrees, he also admits that he doesn’t know for sure. "All I can tell you is that Mr. Christian always seemed a very decent and sincere fella to me."

Dice, of course, is far from the only person with a theory about the Guidestones. Jay Weidner, a former Seattle radio commentator turned erudite conspiracy hunter, has heavily invested time and energy into one of the most popular hypotheses. He argues that Christian and his associates were Rosicrucians, followers of the Order of the Rosy Cross, a secret society of mystics that originated in late medieval Germany and claim understanding of esoteric truths about nature, the universe, and the spiritual realm that have been concealed from ordinary people. Weidner considers the name R. C. Christian an homage to the legendary 14th-century founder of the Rosicrucians, a man first identified as Frater C.R.C. and later as Christian Rosenkreuz. Secrecy, Weidner notes, has been a hallmark of the Rosicrucians, a group that announced itself to the world in the early 17th century with a pair of anonymous manifestos that created a huge stir across Europe, despite the fact that no one was ever able to identify a single member. While the guides on the Georgia stones fly in the face of orthodox Christian eschatology, they conform quite well to the tenets of Rosicrucianism, which stress reason and endorse a harmonic relationship with nature.
Weidner also has a theory about the purpose of the Guidestones. An authority on the hermetic and alchemical traditions that spawned the Rosicrucians, he believes that for generations the group has been passing down knowledge of a solar cycle that climaxes every 13,000 years. During this culmination, outsize coronal mass ejections are supposed to devastate Earth. Meanwhile, the shadowy organization behind the Guidestones is now orchestrating a "planetary chaos," Weidner believes, that began with the recent collapse of the US financial system and will result eventually in major disruptions of oil and food supplies, mass riots, and ethnic wars worldwide, all leading up to the Big Event on December 21, 2012. "They want to get the population down," Weidner says, "and this is what they think will do it. The Guidestones are there to instruct the survivors."
On hearing Weidner’s ideas, Martin shakes his head and says it’s "the sort of thing that makes me want to tell people everything I know." Martin has long since retired from banking and no longer lives in Elberton, yet he’s still the Guidestones’ official—and only—secret-keeper. "But I can’t tell," the old man quickly adds. "I made a promise." Martin also made a promise to destroy all the records of his dealings with Christian, though he hasn’t kept that one—at least not yet. In the back of his garage is a large plastic bin (actually, the hard-sided case of an IBM computer he bought back in 1983) stuffed with every document connected to the Guidestones that ever came into his possession, including the letters from Christian.
For years Martin thought he might write a book, but now he knows he probably won’t. What he also won’t do is allow me to look through the papers. When I ask whether he’s prepared to take what he knows to his grave, Martin replies that Christian would want him to do just that: "All along, he said that who he was and where he came from had to be kept a secret. He said mysteries work that way. If you want to keep people interested, you can let them know only so much." The rest is enshrouded in the vast sunny stillness. The original article appeared here.

Scott Gives Welcoming Introduction to Putnam

Outgoing Florida Governor Rick Scott is on the campaign trail in his bid to unseat Democratic Senator Bill Nelson, the only Democratic statewide elected lawmaker. Adam Putnam, currently Florida’s Agricultural Commissioner, is on his own campaign to succeed Governor Scott. Both appeared alongside in the Villages, and Governor Scott’s welcoming introduction could be seen an endorsement.
Speaking of Putnam to the audience in the Fenney Recreation Center, Scott told the crowd that “He’s got a job as ag commissioner and he’s focused on how to make sure we bring our citrus industry back, make sure we continue to grow jobs in agriculture and all of those things. He’s got unbelievable relationships in D.C. but also he was been part of all the things we’ve done. We worked together in the Cabinet. He’s been part of the 1.5 million jobs.

Canada’s Chief Dental Officer on fluoride
Source: KOOTENAY NEWS ADVERTISER | September 3rd, 2008
Location: Canada, British Columbia
As the Chief Dental Officer for Canada, I would like to highlight some of the many benefits of water fluoridation.
Water fluoridation is the process of adjusting the level of fluoride in the water to provide dental health benefits. Many governments and health organizations, including Health Canada, the Canadian Public Health Association, the Canadian Dental Association, the Canadian Medical Association and the World Health Organization endorse the fluoridation of drinking water to prevent tooth decay. Community water fluoridation has been identified by U.S. Centers for Disease Control as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
Canada has one of the best systems in the world to ensure water quality. Health Canada supports water fluoridation as a public health measure to prevent dental decay. Dental disease is the number one chronic disease among children and adolescents in North America; fluoridation can therefore be an important public health measure.
An expert panel was formed to provide Health Canada with advice and recommendations on the current state of relevant science with respect to the fluoridation of water. The report from the panel reinforces Health Canada’s position that water fluoridation is important from a public health perspective and that our position on water fluoridation is sound. The report’s recommendations are based on the latest science.
In undertaking the study, we consulted with a number of experts including scientists from the Universities of British Columbia, Toronto, Iowa; scientists from many areas of Health Canada; and also received input from the Canadian Dental Association, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and public health experts from Canada and the U.S.
The safety and efficacy of water fluoridation has been frequently studied and continues to be supported by current science. Canadian and international studies agree that water that was fluoridated at optimum levels does not cause adverse health effects. For example, an adult male would need to consume at least 15, 000 litres of water that is fluoridated at optimum levels continuously in one sitting to get an acute toxic (lethal) dose of fluoride.
There is also no evidence to suggest that children should avoid drinking fluoridated water at the accepted levels in Canadian drinking water supplies.
The big advantage of water fluoridation is that it benefits all residents in a community, regardless of age, socioeconomic status, education, or employment. Health Canada continues to support water fluoridation as a safe, cost effective public health measure, and encourages Canadians to review respected and credible sources of information to reach their own conclusions about water fluoridation.

Flashback: Joel Osteen Says God “Approves” of Those Who Engage in Sodomy

Apostate preacher Joel Osteen continues to play the pied piper, leading blind down the road of destruction in America. In an interview with the Huffington Post, he said that God "absolutely" approves of every person, including those who practice sodomy.
In promoting his new book Break Out! 5 Keys to Go Beyond Your Barriers and Live an Extraordinary Life, the charlatan of Lakewood Church in Houston told the Huffington Post about what he thought of those who engage in sodomy.
During the interview, Josh Zepps of HuffPo Live quoted Osteen's book, "It doesn't matter who likes you or who doesn't like you, all that matters is God likes you. He accepts you, he approves of you."

He then asked Osteen if that reference included those who engage in sodomy.
"Absolutely," Osteen insisted, "I believe that God has breathed his life into every single person. We're all on a journey. Nobody's perfect."
He went on to attempt to mesh sodomy with other sins.
"The Bible said a sin is pride, a sin is selfish ambition. We tend to pick out these certain things," Osteen said. "But I believe every person is made in the image of God, and you have accept them as they are, on their journey. I'm not here to be preaching hate, pushing people down. I'm not here telling people what they're doing wrong."
I agree. The Bible does point out these things as sin, but we don't leave those off, just because at a particular moment we may be speaking to someone who engages in the sin of sodomy. We hold God's standard high on all of these things.
In fact, sodomy is referred to as an abomination, but did you also know other sins are listed as abominations?
Lying lips (Prov. 12:22)
Wicked thoughts (Prov. 15:26)
Pride (Prov. 16:5)
Unequal weights and measures (Prov. 20:10)
Sometimes our prayers are (Prov. 28:9)
Sometimes our worship is (Deut. 17:3-4)
Child sacrifice and divination (Deut. 18:10-12)
Our trinkets (crosses, rabbit's foot, etc.) (Deut. 27:15)
Even our words (Prov. 16:6)
This is why even when we deal with the issue of sodomy, even calling it an abomination, we should remember that other sins are referenced in the same way. However, God never says he accepts any of us when we are practicing these things. In fact, He rejects us, and we have ample evidence from the Scriptures that he did so to those in the Old Testament (cf. 1 Cor. 10). The Scriptures even teach us that He is "angry with the wicked every day" (Psalm 7:11) and "visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate" Him (Exodus 20:5).
Now, understand that in 2012, Osteen did say that engaging in sodomy is a sin. He told Fox News' Chris Wallace, "I believe the scripture says that being gay is a sin. But, you know, every time I say that, Chris … people say, well, you are a gay hater and you're a gay basher," Osteen told Wallace during the interview. "I'm not. I don't – I don't dislike anybody. Gays are some of the nicest, kindest, most loving people in the world. But my faith is based on what I believe the scripture says, and that's the way I read the scripture."
There is some of this I agree with. Simply because we view sodomy as sin, does not mean we don't have any compassion to tell those in sin the truth. That does not mean we hate them. It's actually an act of love, in the same manner that when my children are doing wrong, it's my job as a parent to correct them, and even discipline them, so that they learn what is right for their own good. However, to then tell those engaged in sin that God "approves" of them or "accepts" them while they practice their wickedness is a lie from the father of lies.
Sodom was destroyed for a plethora of sins, but the predominant one that was focused on in Genesis 19 was the sin of sodomy (the men of the city wanted to "know" (rape) the angels that came to Lot's house), from which we get the name. God turned it literally into Hell and utterly destroyed the city and the people.
Osteen is doing no favors for those who engage in sodomy. One would be better off to listen to the words of Jesus. In speaking of false prophets, Jesus said:
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Matthew 7:15-23
Quickly, Jesus points out that false prophets are known by their fruits. Look at the fruit of Osteen. Is it really doing the will of the Father or making people comfortable in their sin (telling them that God accepts them in their sin, but never calling them to repent of that sin). Does it look like Jesus accepts people who call Him Lord, but don't obey? Who preach, but don't obey? Who cast out devils, but don't obey? Who do wonderful works, but don't obey? No. He says for them to depart from Him because they work iniquity. In the vernacular, Jesus tells them to "Get lost" because they practice lawlessness, or sin (1 John 3:4).
For anyone who practices sodomy, or any sin for that matter, the command of God is for you to repent of your sin and put your faith in the Son of God, who demonstrated His love for sinners by giving His life to set them free from their sin.

U.S. hopes to continue talks with North Korea: Pompeo
Written by Maga First News on March 15, 2019

March 15, 2019
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The United States is hopeful that it can continue to hold denuclearization talks with North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday following reports that a top Pyongyang official had said the country may suspend negotiations.
Pompeo, speaking at a news conference, also said he had every expectation that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would live up to his commitment not to resume nuclear and missile testing.
“We’re hopeful that we can continue to have conversations, negotiations,” the top U.S. diplomat told reporters, adding that North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui had left open the possibility of continued talks in the reported remarks.
“It’s the administration’s desire that we continue to have conversations around this,” Pompeo added.
U.S. officials have said they remain open to talks after the second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump collapsed last month with no deal, but have given no specifics.

Biometric data belonging to millions of Americans may or may not be at risk—it is frankly unclear—based on a BuzzFeed report published Tuesday. At least two experts are concerned anyway, according to the site.
The full story, well-sourced and exhaustively reported, details how code developed by a Russian company found its way into fingerprint-recognition software reportedly used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the TSA PreCheck program, as well as some 18,000 other American law enforcement agencies including the New York City Police Department.

According to BuzzFeed, a French company called Sagem Sécurité, later renamed Morpho, supplied the software but “deliberately concealed” that a portion of the code was purchased from a Russian firm called Papillon AO. Sagem Sécurité reportedly paid the equivalent of about $6 million upfront to use the code in its own fingerprint-analysis program, in addition to some recurring annual fees.
Per BuzzFeed, Papillon has boasted in marketing materials about collaborating on product development with various Kremlin agencies, including the Ministry of Defense and the Federal Security Service, Russia’s chief security agency, also known as the FSB. BuzzFeed states that the association raises “concerns that Russian hackers could gain backdoor access to sensitive biometric information on millions of Americans, or even compromise wider national security and law enforcement computer systems.”
While a former policy director for the National Security Agency told BuzzFeed that knowledge of the company’s secret Russian-made code would have made him “nervous,” and a former Morpho employee said it would have left him “a little bit” concerned, none of the sources appear to claim the actual code itself contains a backdoor. BuzzFeed suggests that none of the cybersecurity experts it consulted had examined the code—had they, we’d likely know whether any proof of this speculative backdoor actually exists—and neither of the two sources named as whistleblowers were personally involved in implementing the code or the sale of it to the FBI, the report says.

No other details regarding a potential backdoor appear in the article; Papillon denies that a backdoor exists; and the FBI notes, generally speaking, that the security behind any software it purchases is scrutinized prior to being rolled out. Moreover, the contract reviewed by BuzzFeed is also said to contain a statement that, to the best of Papillon’s knowledge, the code it licensed to Morpho does not contain any backdoor or trojan-like capabilities.
The report is contextualized with references to the cyberattacks that targeted top Democrats during the 2016 election—which US intelligence has attributed with high confidence to the Russian government—as well as a more recent controversy involving Moscow-based Kaspersky Labs, software from which federal agencies are no longer allowed to use, per a Department of Homeland Security mandate and, later, legislation signed by President Donald Trump. (Kaspersky is suing the Trump administration over the ban.)
The code BuzzFeed’s article centers around was sold roughly a decade ago, according to an unsigned copy of a licensing agreement between Morpho and Papillon obtained by BuzzFeed. And with regard to Kaspersky, the fact that the company shuttled data back and forth was a known function of its antivirus software, not a backdoor, and the company isn’t being credibly accused of having compromising “Kremlin-ties” as much as it is getting hacked.

A key clause in the contract stipulates that the companies agreed “not to disclose [the contract] by any means,” BuzzFeed reports. Whether foreign companies are disclosing the origins of their source code when selling software to the US government is, by itself, probably a big deal.
One of the whistleblowers cited by the website is party to an antitrust lawsuit against Morpho’s former parent company, Sofran—Morpho is now owned by a US firm and has been renamed Idemia, just to keep things confusing—which alleges that Sofran and Papillon had secretly agreed not to compete for contracts in certain countries including, apparently, the United States. A federal judge dismissed the case this year on technicalities, and it is currently on appeal.
The FBI declined to respond to BuzzFeed’s specific inquiries about the biometric software—which is not surprising—but otherwise noted: “As is typical for all commercial software that we operate, appropriate security reviews were completed prior to operational deployment.”

Eminem mentioned a whole bunch of people on his surprise album and here’s the list
Admin | September 2, 2018 | Uncategorized | No Comments
On Friday Eminem dropped a new surprise album called Kamikaze.
The album was executive produced by Dr. Dre and the rapper himself and features Jessie Reyez among others.
The Detroit artist mentions a number of rappers and seemingly comes after those who criticised his previously released album, Revival that received a mixed reception from critics when it was released in 2017.

Wolf of Whale Street	
Leo DiCaprio gives $50K to help Adrian Grenier find the “Loneliest Whale”
By Ted Alvarez on Mar 11, 2015
Get your daily dose of good news from Grist Subscribe to The Beacon
The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has just donated $50,000 to ensure that Adrian Grenier gets to Kickstart his latest environmental passion project: 52: The Search for the Loneliest Whale. This documentary from Grenier and Josh Zeman will attempt to “re-find” a particular, very emo whale, which was first discovered by the U.S. Navy over 20 years ago. Said sad whale sings at a frequency no other whale can hear (52 hertz), so he’s the loneliest whale in the entire Pacific, which I guess is pretty dang bleak. (Unless he’s a loner by nature, in which case he finally has some goddamned peace and quiet. You never know.)
Grenier got involved “when a documentary producing partner called and asked if [he] wanted to participate.” That is perhaps less dramatic than what we’d hoped for, so allow us to submit this alternate brotacular origin story. It probably happened over many beers.

LEO: I love you, man!
ADRIAN: No, we love the ENVIRONMENT, man!
LEO: Totally.
ADRIAN: I also love The Wolf of Wall Street. You totally should’ve won.
LEO: Oh, thanks man. Entourage was pretty tight, for TV.
ADRIAN: … Um, thanks. Say, would you want to help me re-find this whale with literally no entourage? Y’know, since you love oceans and shit. Whales are all up in there. Just need about 50 Gs.
LEO: Sounds dope. [Digs under yacht captain’s seat cushion.] Here you go.
ADRIAN: OMG! Thanks, bro. Have another Church Key beer, on me. It’s kinda weird, I know, but someone made a phone call and asked if I wanted to participate and … you can see my problem. I’m just too passionate.
LEO: I totally know what you mean, dudebro.
ADRIAN: [Cheers.] So I guess now I can call you The Wolf of WHALE Street!
LEO: What did you just call me?
ADRIAN: The Wolf of Whale … like, because of the animal … the movie … we just talked —
LEO: I’m just fucking with you. I love you, man! [Chugs.]

What comes to mind when you think of Donald Trump? Homophobe? Sexist? Hatemonger? Far-Right? Unfortunately, Brazilian politician Jair Bolsonaro is all of those things — and like Trump, he might actually make it to the presidency.
Who is Jair Bolsonaro?
Bolsonaro started his political career in 1988. Prior to that, he served in the Brazilian Army as a parachutist. Though he started his career as part of the Christian Democratic Party, he’s currently aligned with the Social Christian Party (or Partido Social Cristão, also known as the PSC).
The PSC was originally a centrist party, but in 2013, it took a hard-right turn. The PSC wooed Bolsonaro from the Progressistas party — which, despite its name, is a center-right party — in 2016.
Bolsonaro is also a popular politician. He was first elected city councillor in Brazil’s capital city, Rio de Janeiro. In 1990, he was elected to be the federal congressman from Rio, serving four consecutive terms.
What does Jair Bolsonaro believe?
Bolsonaro is hard right. He’s an open anti-communist. He also openly defends the Brazilian militarist regime that took power in 1964. He’s come out against any form of same-sex unions, particularly marriage. Bolsonaro has also fought against affirmative action-like policies and the decriminalization of drugs.
Democracy returned to Brazil in 1985, though in 1993, he praised the military regime that previously ruled the country. He’s also praised Peru’s president Alberto Fujimori for using military intervention against the judicial and legislative branches of that country’s government. Bolsonaro has argued for the death penalty and military intervention into the Brazilian government.
Sexist and homophobic comments by Jair Bolsonaro
Like Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro has made his fair share of ignorant, controversial comments. In 2015, he was fined 10,000 reais (or about $2,500) for saying he would never rape female politician Maria do Rosario, because she wasn’t “worth it” because “she is very ugly.”
In his stump speech, he said he’d “rather have a dead son over a gay son.” And he’s also said “fundamentalist homosexual groups are trying to take over society… want to reach our children in order to turn them into gay adults to satisfy [homosexuals’] sexuality in the future.” Bolsonaro has also said gay couples’ right to adoption is like pedophilia and claimed homosexuality is a result of drug use.
Like Trump, whenever Jair Bolsonaro says something repulsive, his popularity rises.
Unfortunately, just like when Trump says something awful and his supporters rally around him, the same thing happens with Bolsonaro. In April he trailed Brazil’s former president Lula by 15%; now that Lula has left the race, Bolsonaro has the majority of the votes. He’s particularly popular among evangelicals, and identifies with other far-right candidates from around the world. He’s blamed his critics for attempting to “stifle him” like French far-right politician Marine Le Pen. Le Pen lost her election this year to Emmanuel Macron.
And like Trump, Bolsonaro’s toxic views have led the media to not take him seriously — which Bolsonaro could use for his advantage. Sadly, Trump’s election has shown itself not to be a fluke. Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has also been compared to Trump due to his outspoken nature and also won his country’s presidency.
Will Jair Bolsonaro follow in Donald Trump’s and Rodrigo Duterte’s steps? We hope not — but fear he will.

Important Information About Your Drinking Water from the Horsham Water & Sewer Authority
Posted Date:
9/15/2014
Horsham Water and Sewer Authority Takes 2 Wells Out of Service Due to Detection of Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) Above Provisional Health Advisory Level.
Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Horsham Water and Sewer Authority (The Authority) monitors the quality of water from each of the groundwater wells used to provide your water. We sample as required for substances for which the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have set primary drinking water standards. As we recently reported to you in our annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR), all of the Authority’s in-service wells produce water into the system that meets the primary drinking water standards.
In addition to routine sampling, the 1996 amendments to the SDWA require that once every five years, the EPA issue a new list of unregulated contaminants to be monitored by public water systems (PWSs). The Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) provides EPA and other interested parties with scientifically valid data on the possible occurrence of non-regulated contaminants in drinking water. These data serve as a primary source of occurrence and exposure information that the agency then uses to develop future regulatory decisions.
On July 30, 2014, the Authority received the first set of results from samples collected for new compounds under the latest round of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3). One of the substances detected was Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS). While further evaluations of this contaminant are performed, EPA has established a Provisional Health Advisory (PHA) level for PFOS of 0.2 micrograms per liter (µg/L). One microgram per liter is equivalent to one part per billion (ppb).
PHA levels serve as guidance designed to assist federal, state and local officials in evaluating threats to public water supplies. Health advisories serve as guidance only and are not enforceable. You can visit EPA’s website for more information about PHA levels at the following webpage: http://water.epa.gov/drink/standards/hascience.cfm
The provisional health advisories for PFOS and PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) can be found at: http://water.epa.gov/action/advisories/drinking/upload/2009_01_15_criteria_drinking_pha-PFOA_PFOS.pdf
Two of the Authority supply wells, Well No. 26 and Well No. 40 were recently found to have PFOS above the PHA level (detected at 0.7 ppb and 1.0 ppb respectively). PFOS was also detected in other Authority wells but not above the PHA level. After consulting with DEP, the Authority decided to take Well Nos. 26 and 40 off-line.
PFOS has also been detected at elevated levels in groundwater on the former firefighting training area of the Willow Grove Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base (“NASJRB” or the “Base”). The Authority’s water source closest to the firefighting training area is Well No. 26. After coordinating with both EPA and the Authority, the Navy collected additional samples at Well Nos. 26 and 40 last week in order to confirm the PFOS levels detected in July 2014.
It is possible that the presence of PFOS in the groundwater is related to historic activities at the Base. The Navy and EPA are working to sample multiple locations both on and off the Base. The impact to the groundwater associated with prior Base operations is part of an ongoing cleanup effort for which regular public meetings through the NASJRB Restoration Advisory Board are held.
What is being done?
The Authority has voluntarily taken both Well No. 26 and Well No. 40 off-line. The Authority is consulting with state and federal agencies regarding potential sources of contamination. We will keep in regular contact with DEP, EPA, and the Navy to discuss the situation and evaluate possible response actions, including treatment options for these wells.
The Authority has other sources of water which are not affected, and also has the ability to purchase water from neighboring suppliers. The Authority will continually monitor supply and demand in order to determine the possible need for future water conservation measures.
What should you do?
Since the two wells that were impacted by PFOS were taken off-line, you do not need to take any action at your home, office, or school. You do not need to boil your water or provide treatment at your tap. If you have specific health concerns, you should contact your healthcare professional.
What does this mean?
PFOS is one of several perfluorinated compounds that are used, or were once used, in a variety of commercial and consumer products, such as fire-fighting foam, stain and water repellants, paper products, the lining of microwave popcorn bags, floor wax, and non-stick cookware.
PFOS is persistent in the environment and it is estimated by health officials that perfluorinated compounds such as PFOS and PFOA are present in the blood of most people in the United States. In laboratory animals, PFOS can cause developmental, reproductive, and other adverse effects. Studies of exposure to PFOS and adverse health outcomes in humans are inconclusive. EPA is in the process of seeking comments on health effects assessments for PFOS and PFOA. For more information regarding PFOS, you can visit the following EPA webpages:
http://water.epa.gov/drink/standards/upload/Peer-Review-of-Health-Effects-Documents-for-PFOA-and-PFOS-Factsheet-February-2014.pdf
http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-04/documents/factsheet_contaminant_pfos_pfoa_march2014.pdf
Please share this information with other people who also receive water from Horsham Water and Sewer Authority who may not have received this notice directly (for example, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools and businesses). You can do this by posting this notice in a public place or distributing copies by hand or mail.
This notice is being sent to you by the Horsham Water and Sewer Authority.
For more information, please contact Tina O’Rourke, Business Manager at 215-672-8011.

Do Immigrants Receive Public Benefits
"Do Immigrants Receive Public Benefits?
Eric Pavri has been an immigration lawyer for eight years and is currently the Director of Family Immigration Services at Catholic Charities of Central Colorado. In a Facebook post, he provides answers to this question. The following paragraphs are almost word for word from his post, formatted for readability:
Only a U.S. citizen or a Lawful Permanent Resident (green card holder) can receive almost all types of public benefit – including Medicaid, Medicare, SSI disability, Social Security payments for seniors, TANF, and food stamps.
The irony: most undocumented immigrants work under made-up Social Security numbers and so receive a paycheck from which Social Security, federal income taxes, and state income taxes are withheld, and of course they pay the same local sales and property taxes as anyone else through retail purchases, pass-through costs of apartment leases, etc. Same of course goes for the 800,000 current DACA recipients, who are authorized to legally work in the U.S. But none of those employees, despite paying IN to the system, will ever receive those public benefits listed above, that are paid for by the money withheld from their paychecks. So they are propping up our federal and state government entitlement programs because they pay in but won’t ever take out.
The following are the public benefits that undocumented immigrants can receive in United States:
Public education for children in grades K-12. This was definitively established by a 1982 Supreme Court case, Plyler v. Doe. The Supreme Court in its reasoning explicitly stated that it would not serve the overall public good of the U.S. to leave many thousands of children uneducated.
Emergency room services, but only to the point where the patient is considered “medically stable”, at which point he/she is released. These services are not free, however, as in my job I meet hundreds of immigrant families who sacrifice over years to slowly pay off high emergency room medical bills.
WIC assistance. This is for milk, food, etc., and available only to pregnant mothers. The rationale is that the children in the womb will be U.S. citizens when born, and therefore it is in the long-term economic best interests of the nation to ensure that they receive adequate prenatal nutrition to improve their chances of being productive citizens in the decades to come.
Assistance from police if they are the victim of a crime and call for help. To their credit, the vast majority of our Colorado Springs law enforcement officers take their duty to protect all people seriously. Chief Carey of the CSPD and Sheriff Elder of the EPCSO have made clear that their officers can’t do their most important job – keeping us safe by getting dangerous criminals off our streets – if a whole class of people (undocumented immigrants) is afraid to call 911 to report crimes that they witness or are victim to.
Assistance from a fire department. Rationale, besides the obvious moral one: If your house was next to that of an undocumented immigrant family, would you want the firefighters to let that house continue to burn, putting yours at risk of catching on fire too?
And that’s it. Those, to the best of my knowledge, are the only public benefits that an undocumented immigrant can receive in just about any part of the United States. As someone who directs a small office that works with hundreds of low-income immigrant families per year, know that when I see the precarious economic situation of many of these families, I'd help them access other benefits if they could. But they simply can't. Now, children of undocumented parents, born in the U.S., are U.S. citizens under the 14th Amendment (the one that declares that all human beings born on U.S. soil are citizens – this was passed immediately after the Civil War to forever end the legal argument that African Americans were not U.S. citizens). As such, those children can qualify for the same public benefits as any other U.S. citizen, if they qualify through economic need or disability. But their parents or undocumented siblings cannot.

The Moral Virtues of Capitalism
Noah Rothman, Commentary | PUBLISHED Jan 8, 2019 |
““There’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez replied when confronted with some of her most factually-challenged remarks. It’s heartening to see the discomfort produced by her effort to excuse well-meaning deception, but it’s a little concerning that Ocasio-Cortez’s idea of what constitutes morality has not received similar scrutiny.
“We only have empty pockets when it comes to the morally right things to do,” the congresswoman said in August, citing “100 percent renewable energy that is going to save this planet” as one of several moral imperatives. Merits aside, the morality of that objective is debatable. What is not debatable is the way Ocasio-Cortez and her allies hope to achieve it: by subverting the marketplace, which is one of the most morally sound mechanisms humanity has ever devised.
A draft resolution before Congress advocating Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal” devotes an entire section to explaining why “incentivizing the private sector” to mitigate the threat posed by climate change “doesn’t work.” That is a sentiment likely shared by environmental catastrophists who believe that the only way to mitigate the threat posed by climate change is to “systematically dismantle capitalism.” In fact, the market is arguably the more effective vehicle for addressing their core concerns.”

Allegra Frank, Vox
"Former Nick Jr. kids are now reckoning with this all-grown-up intrepid explorer, whose obstacles are a lot bigger than Swiper the Fox. And that is a hard pill to swallow."
Money
Don't Misread the Inverted Yield Curve
Mohamed A. El-Erian, Bloomberg
"At the end of last week, the three-month Treasury bills' yield rose above the yield for 10-year Treasuries for the first time since 2007, prompting warnings that the U.S. is headed for recession later this year or in early 2020."
Tech
A New Way for AI to Predict Elections
Maayan Jaffe-Hoffman, Jerusalem Post
"A team of researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology attempted to answer some questions about voting with the help of artificial intelligence (AI)."

No Use Fighting Conspiracy Theories
Maggie Koerth-Baker, FiveThirtyEight

The Good Guy/Bad Guy Myth
Catherine Nichols, Aeon
"Pop culture today is obsessed with the battle between good and evil. Traditional folktales never were. What changed?"
Family
The Many Shades of Fear-Based Parenting
Peter Gray, Psychology Today

America Blew It on Arugula
Amanda Mull, The Atlantic
"Arugulagate. In 2007, Barack Obama was in Iowa, speaking as a presidential hopeful to a group of farmers who were worried about the stagnation of their crop prices while America’s grocery bills continued to rise."
Science
When Physics Becomes the Study of Mind
Bernardo Kastrup, Scientific American
"To say that information exists in and of itself is akin to speaking of spin without the top, of ripples without water, of a dance without the dancer, or of the Cheshire Cat’s grin without the cat."

Our Prayers Are With You…
In light of the recent events that have taken place within the past few days, we, here at JGM, would like to the time to solicit prayers for all of those families who have been either directly or indirectly affected by the acts of violence that have taken the lives of their loved ones. It saddens us to think that it has taken these events to bring us all together and to the point of soliciting prayers, not only for our own, but for others apart from our immediate inner circle. As believers and citizens of the Kingdom of God, this should be our position and posture 365 days of every year without fail…without reservation.
So at this time, we would like to say that our prayers are with all of those families throughout the world who have lost loved ones due to senseless violence either recently or in the past. We pray that God will bring the peace and strength that each of you will need in the days to come…
With Love,
Sean Mungin and The Joshua Generation Ministries

VGGT Expropriation, Compensation, Resettlement
Voluntary Guidelines - Section 16 (Expropriation, Compensation, Resettlement)
This qualitative dataset shows how national laws measure up against the international standards on expropriation, compensation, and resettlement as established in Section 16 of the UN Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGTs). The UN Committee on World Food Security, a body consisting of 193 governments, endorsed the VGGTs in 2012.
If the national laws assessed fully adopt the VGGT principle, then a score of "A" is given.
If national laws assessed partially adopt the VGGT principle, then a score of "B" is given.
If national laws assessed do not adopt the VGGT principle, then a score of "C" is given.
Answering the questions posed by these indicators entailed reviewing a broad range of legally binding instruments, including national constitutions, land acquisition acts, land acts, communal land acts, agricultural land acts, land use acts, and regulations.

My PhD research project, facilitated by the University of Groningen Faculty of Law, aims to bridge this gap by providing a broad comparative analysis of nation legal frameworks in 50 countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America to determine whether legal procedures in these countries adopt internationally recognized standards on expropriation, compensation, and resettlement.

It happens that society is saved as often as the circle of its ruling class is narrowed, as often as a more exclusive interest asserts itself over the general. Every demand for the most simple bourgeois financial reform, for the most ordinary liberalism, for the most commonplace republicanism, for the flattest democracy is forthwith punished as an assault upon society and is branded as Socialism.

There are two kinds of existentialist; first, those who are Christian...and on the other hand the atheistic existentialists, among whom...I class myself. What they have in common is that they think that existence precedes essence, or, if you prefer, that subjectivity must be the turning point.

Of actions some aim at what is necessary and useful, and some at what is honorable. And the preference given to one or the other class of actions must necessarily be like the preference given to one or other part of the soul and its actions over the other; there must be war for the sake of peace, business for the sake of leisure, things useful and necessary for the sake of things honorable.

You've seen my statements, I do very well, I don't mind paying some taxes. The middle class is getting clobbered in this country. You know the middle class built this country, not the hedge fund guys, but I know people in hedge funds that pay almost nothing and it's ridiculous.

Let us not envy a certain class of men for their enormous riches; they have paid such an equivalent for them that it would not suit us; they have given for them their peace of mind, their health, their honor, and their conscience; this is rather too dear, and there is nothing to be made out of such a bargain.

Literary works cannot be taken over like factories, or literary forms of expression like industrial methods. Realist writing, of which history offers many widely varying examples, is likewise conditioned by the question of how, when and for what class it is made use of.

Darwin's book is very important and serves me as a basis in natural science for the class struggle in history. One has to put up with the crude English method of development, of course. Despite all deficiencies not only is the death-blow dealt here for the first time to 'teleology' in the natural sciences, but their rational meaning is empirically explained.
Karl Marx

Report...
We must not depict socialism as if socialists will bring it to us on a plate all nicely dressed. That will never happen. Not a single problem of the class struggle has ever been solved in history except by violence. When violence is exercised by the working people, by the mass of exploited against the exploiters — then we are for it!
Vladimir Lenin

Report...
I believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights, that each community, as a State, has a right to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that State that interfere with the right of no other State, and that the general government, upon principle, has no right to interfere with anything other than that general class of things that does concern the whole.
Abraham Lincoln

Report...
One of the basic conditions for the victory of socialism is the arming of the workers Communist and the disarming of the bourgeoisie the middle class.
Vladimir Lenin
Source
Report...
By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labor. By proletariat, the class of modern wage laborers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor power in order to live.
Friedrich Engels

Report...
The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. Now, any class — it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States. And it's as he or she deems appropriate. Hopefully it's he in this case.
Donald Trump

Report...
In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate its indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe.
Karl Marx

Report...
There are three classes of readers; some enjoy without judgment; others judge without enjoyment; and some there are who judge while they enjoy, and enjoy while they judge. The latter class reproduces the work of art on which it is engaged. Its numbers are very small.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Source
Report...
Throughout the civilised world the teachings of Marx evoke the utmost hostility and hatred of all bourgeois science (both official and liberal), which regards Marxism as a kind of pernicious sect. And no other attitude is to be expected, for there can be no impartial social science in a society based on class struggle. In one way or another, all official and liberal science defends wage-slavery, whereas Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery. To expect science to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly naïve as to expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether workers' wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of capital.
Vladimir Lenin

Report...
In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite the high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples, and to barter truth, love, and honour for traffic in wool, beet-root sugar, and potato spirits.
Karl Marx

Report...
I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a society divided by class and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class by any means necessary.
Jean-Paul Sartre

All bad Literature rests upon imperfect insight, or upon imitation, which may be defined as seeing at second-hand.

Mohawks and Henna: Ideas for treating cancer with fun
I’ve been wracking my brain trying to decide on an OT-related thing to write about today. It’s hard to think of things after being out of school a month. I thought briefly about writing about my experience watching pediatric burn care, or sharing a really bad poem I wrote about grief, or maybe digging up another story from fieldwork. But I’m not feeling inspired. So I’ll tell you something that does inspire me.
My mom was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer a few years ago. She decided to undergo chemotherapy and radiation, which is obviously not fun. But she did it with humor. When her hair started to fall out from the chemotherapy, she went and got a rainbow mohawk. She kept it in a day or two and then shaved it off. And then once she was completely bald, she got a henna artist to come to her house. The henna artist tatooed her scalp using Mom’s original designs, and then added glitter and gems. It was beautiful.
Luckily her treatment was successful. It’s now been several years and there is no sign of the cancer. I am so grateful to have her and I am so proud of how she handled her treatments! I think it would be great if more cancer patients could embrace the idea of having a little fun with their cancer journey.
When my mom is handed lemons in life, she doesn’t make lemonade, she makes lemonart! (I spent like ten minutes trying to think of a clever lemon pun, but totally never managed it. I’m giving up.) Hope you like the the pictures!!

Samsung announces unbreakable phone screen panel
Posted by Mister Mo
It was just a few days ago that Corning announced Gorilla Glass 6, the latest version of their screen protection glass, with the promise of protection from drops. Samsung Display Company has announced an unbreakable phone screen technology they developed. Should Gorilla Glass, Dinorex Glass, Dragontrail Glass and other display protection brands be worried?
Samsung’s indestructible display is composed of a “flexible OLED panel with an unbreakable substrate and an overlay window securely adhered to it. Current-generation flexible display products attach a glass-covered window to their display that often breaks when severely impacted”.
In plain English, Samsung is using fortified plastic window that has the strengths of glass but not its weakness. It is lightweight, transmissive, and hard, yet not fragile. So, I am wondering why everyone else in this business has been insistent on glass. Perhaps we shall find out when we get our hands on a device that has this new plastic unbreakable phone screen.

Broken Promises
We all know that the promises of display protection from falls and all by Gorilla Glass and its competitors do not always work. If there ever is a literal case of broken promises, it is with toughened glass protection for smartphones.
The often-inevitable fall is that one thing that smartphone owners fear above all other fears. The result is often a shattered or broken display.
So, Samsung say they have solved that problem. If they have, all the protective glass companies need to panic and quickly go back to their drawing boards.
Unbreakable Phone Screen Tested and Certified
Samsung Display Company say their new, indestructible phone screen panel “passed the rigorous real-time durability test that is based on military standards set by the U.S. Department of Defense” and survived drops of up to 1.8 metres.
The display reportedly “continued to function normally with no damage to its front, sides or edges”. Impressive. The panel has been certified by UL (Underwriters Laboratories), an official testing company for OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor.
I love what I am reading and look forward to seeing this on production devices. Perhaps finally, the smartphone world can say a hearty goodbye to worrying about losing $1000 smartphones to a random drop. Who wants an unbreakable phone screen?

Left Hijacking a Tragedy
Gary Bauer · Mar. 16, 2018
Wednesday marked the first of two big protests for gun control. Students walked out of class for 17 minutes in more than 3,000 demonstrations across the country. The protest was billed as a memorial of sorts for the 17 teachers and students killed in the Parkland shooting. Certainly many students participated for exactly that reason.
But it is obvious that this protest was driven by left-wing organizations that were not memorializing innocent children. Instead, they were exploiting other children to advance a radical, anti-Second Amendment agenda.
Groups like the Women’s March Youth Empower, who paraded their daughters through Washington with obscene hats, played a big role. By the way, the Women’s March, which is already in trouble for its leader’s affinity for anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan, celebrated a cop killer last year.
Major left-wing groups like MoveOn.org, Michael Bloomberg’s gun control organizations and Hollywood elites acted quickly to hijack the Parkland tragedy. The left-wing pacifists of Code Pink used Wednesday’s student walkout to demand an end to the Junior ROTC program on high school campuses.
As usual, the Left has it exactly backwards. At least three of Parkland’s JROTC students were heroes last month. One of whom, Peter Wang, died protecting his classmates. America should be encouraging more participation in JROTC programs, not less.
Schools Split
Reaction to the protests split school districts across the country. Some promoted the protests, while others insisted students remain in class.
In Sayreville, New Jersey, School Board President Kevin Ciak was clear — students who left the building would be suspended. “Schools do not have the ability to pick political issues,” Ciak insisted. Good for him!
Here in Washington, DC, students from area high schools headed to Capitol Hill for what was obviously a preplanned political rally. Well-known youthful reformers like Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were waiting to join the demonstration against the Second Amendment.
And of course, Bernie was protected by heavily armed guards.
Having watched video of that event, I assure you it was in no way a memorial to anything. There was raucous laughter and celebration. About what exactly? Seventeen children and teachers are dead largely because of the malfeasance of adults in local government and at the FBI, which received two warnings about the killer.
I have also seen multiple videos from all over the country showing students not mourning but gleefully holding anti-Trump signs. At a school in Tennessee, students tore down the American flag and attacked a police car.
I would be interested in hearing from you. How was this handled in your area? Did local schools promote the walkouts or did they insist students stay in class?
There is also a certain irony in all of this. Student organizers are quick to tell critics that they have a constitutional right to speak up. But, of course, they are speaking up to do away with the constitutional rights that the rest of us have to own firearms to defend ourselves and our families.
Here’s an interesting mental exercise. Imagine that there were a major religious group with as much money as George Soros. Suppose it announced that it was asking schools all over America to release students for 17 minutes to pray for the victims of the Parkland shooting.
Does anyone think for a second that the entire left-wing establishment would have embraced such a request for students to pray?
Round Two
Another round of tax cuts may be coming. For example, one of the Left’s major attacks against the Trump tax cuts was that reductions in the corporate tax rate were made permanent while tax cuts for families were not.
Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said this week, “While the tax cuts for families were long-term, they’re not yet permanent. So we’re going to address issues like that."
That would be a good idea. Nancy Pelosi has already vowed to repeal major portions of the Trump tax cuts if her party gains power. Republicans should force Democrats to go on the record for or against tax cuts for families as many times as they can.
Larry Kudlow, who has agreed to serve as White House economic adviser, has also suggested lowering the capital gains tax rate.
I am all for those things. But I believe Republican leaders will be making a huge mistake if they think they can maintain the majority on tax cuts alone. If the party is AWOL on values issues, immigration and border security, they will be letting down many Trump voters, the very people they need to turnout "bigly” in November.
The United Left
Saturday is St. Patrick’s Day. In keeping with tradition, Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, is in the United States promoting common interests. But there is something else on his mind.
Mr. Varadkar is a liberal homosexual. He met with President Trump yesterday and has been invited to have breakfast with Vice President Pence today.
Unfortunately, speaking with reporters, the Irish prime minister promised to lecture Vice President Pence about “the wider issue of equal rights and freedoms for LGBT citizens.” You will recall that then-Gov. Pence got into a major battle with the LGBT community when he tried to defend religious liberty in Indiana.
If the prime minister were in meetings in Iran, would he dare lecture the ayatollah on LGBT issues? As you may know, that evil regime actually has a death penalty for homosexual conduct.
Meanwhile, President Trump and Vice President Pence are trying to stop the ayatollah from developing nuclear weapons. But I suspect Prime Minister Varadkar, like most of the Left, isn’t particularly supportive of President Trump’s approach toward Iran.
My friends, this is another reminder that the Left not only hates Donald Trump’s populism, it also despises Vice President Pence’s commitment to conservative Christian values. It’s also a reminder that the political Left all over the world stands together against Judeo-Christian values.
Old-School Parenting
Did you hear about the father who posted a video of his son running to school because he was kicked off the school bus for bullying? The video went viral. And, predictably, the progressive crowd did not react well to his example of old-school parenting.
Unfortunately, our country has bigger problems than fathers with old-school parenting styles. Our country is facing a crisis of broken homes and fatherless families. Read more in my latest opinion piece in The Hill.

HIPAA PRIVACY NOTICE
This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed, and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully.
INTRODUCTION
The Facility understands that your medical information is private and confidential. Further, we are required by law to maintain the privacy of “PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION.” Protected health information includes any individually identifiable information that we obtain from you or others that relate to your past, present or future physical or mental health, the health care you have received, or payment for your health care.
As required by law, this notice provides you with information about your rights and our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your protected health information. We must comply with the provisions of this notice as currently in effect, although we reserve the right to change the terms of this notice from time to time and to make the revised notice effective for all protected health information we maintain. A current copy of this notice will be maintained on our website. You can also request a written copy of our most current privacy notice from the Administrator of the Facility or by contacting our Privacy Officer at 1.844.758.1922 or compliance@elderoutreach.com.
We are required by law to maintain the privacy and security of your protected health information. We will let you know promptly if a breach occurs that may have compromised the privacy or security of your information. We will not use or share your protected health information other than as described here unless you tell us we can in writing. If you tell us we can, you may change your mind at any time. Let us know in writing if you change your mind.
PERMITTED USES AND DISCLOSURES
We can use or disclose your protected health information for the purposes of treatment, payment and health care operations. For each of these categories of uses and disclosures, we have provided a description and an example below. However, not every particular use or disclosure in every category will be listed.
Treatment: means provision, coordination management of your health care, including consultations between health care providers relating to your care and referrals for health care from one healthcare provider to another. For example, an Orthopedist treating you for a hip fracture may need to know if you are also being treated for any heart conditions. If so, the Orthopedist may need to speak to your Cardiologist, as well as a physical therapist, to ensure the appropriate course of treatment.
Payment: means the activities we undertake to obtain reimbursement for the health care provided to you, including billing collections, claims management, determinations of eligibility and coverage and other utilization review activities, for example, prior to providing healthcare services we may need to provide information to your Third Party Payor (such as Medicare, Medicaid or a private insurer) for the services rendered to you, we can provide the Third Party Payor with information regarding your care if necessary to obtain payment. Federal or State law may require us to obtain a written release from you prior to disclosing certain specially protected health information for payment purposes, and we will ask you to sign a release when necessary under applicable law.
Healthcare operations: means the support functions of the Facility related to treatment and payment, such as quality assurance activities, case management, receiving and responding to resident comments, and complaints, physician reviews, compliance programs, audits, business planning, development, management and administrative activities. For example, we may use our protected health information to evaluate the performance of our staff when caring for you. We may also combine health information about many residents to decide what additional services we should offer, what services are not needed and whether certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurse technicians, medical students and others for review and learning purposes. In addition, we may remove information so that others can use the de-identified information to study health care delivery without learning who you are.
Privacy Of MDS Data: MDS assessment data is personal information about nursing facility residents that facilities are required to collect and keep confidential in accordance with federal law. 42 CFR Part 483.20 requires Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing facility providers to collect the resident assessment data that comprises the MDS. This data is considered part of the resident’s medical record and is protected from improper disclosure by Medicare and Medicaid certified facilities by regulation. Nursing facility providers are also required under CFR 483.20 to transmit MDS data to a Federal data repository. Any personal data maintained and retrieved by the Federal government is subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as set forth in the Privacy Act Statement- Health Care Records provided to our residents upon admission.
OTHER USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
In addition, to using and disclosing your information for treatment, payment and healthcare operations, we may use your protected health information in the following ways:
We may contact you to provide appointment reminders for treatment or medical care.
We may contact you to tell you about or recommend possible treatment alternatives or health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.
We may disclose to your family or friends or any other individual identified by you, protected health information directly related to such person’s involvement in your care or the payment for your care. We may use or disclose your protected health information to notify, or assist in the notification of, a family member, a personal representative, or another person responsible for your care, of your location, general condition or death. If you are present or otherwise available, we will give you an opportunity to object to these disclosures, and we will not make these disclosures if you object. If you are not present or otherwise available, we will determine whether a disclosure to your family or friends is in your best interest taking in to account the circumstances and based upon our professional judgment.
When permitted by law, we may coordinate our uses and disclosures of protected health information with public or private entities authorized by law or by charter to assist in disaster relief efforts.
We will allow your family and friends to act on your behalf to pick-up filled prescriptions, medical supplies, x-rays, and similar forms of protected health information, when we determine, in our professional judgment that it is in your best interest to make such disclosures. We will give you an opportunity to object to these disclosures, and we will not make these disclosures if you object.
We may contact you as part of our fundraising and marketing efforts as permitted by applicable law but only with your written permission.
We may use or disclose your protected health information for research purposes, subject to the requirements of applicable law. For example, a research project may involve comparisons of health and recovery of all residents who received a particular medication. All research projects are subject to a special approval process which balances research needs with a resident’s need for privacy. When required, we will obtain a written authorization from you prior to using your health information for research.
We can share protected health information with a coroner, medical examiner, or funeral director when an individual dies.
We can disclose your protected health information if state or federal laws require it, including information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.
We can disclose your protected health information if we suspect that you are the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.
We can disclose your protected heath information to workers’ compensation insurers, State administrators, employers, and other persons or entities involved in workers’ compensation systems to the extent necessary to comply with laws relating to workers’ compensation or similar programs established by law that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.
YOUR RIGHTS RELATED TO YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
You can ask to see or get an electronic or paper copy of your medical record maintained by the Facility. We will provide a copy or a summary of your protected health information, usually within 30 days of your request. We may charge a reasonable, cost-based fee.
You can ask us to correct your medical record if you believe that it incorrect or incomplete. We may say “no” to your request, but we will explain the reason for our denial within 60 days of receipt of your request.
You can ask us to contact you in a specific way (for example, via cell phone) or to send mail to a different address. We will agree to all reasonable requests.
You can ask us not to use or share certain protected health information for treatment, payment, or our operations. We are not required to agree to your request, and we may say “no” if it would affect your care. If you pay for a service or health care item out-of-pocket in full, you can ask us not to share that information for the purpose of payment or our operations with your health insurer. We will honor the request unless a law requires that we disclose the information.
You can ask for a list (accounting) of the times we have shared your protected health information for six years prior to the date you ask, who we shared it with, and why. We will include all the disclosures except for those about treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, and certain other disclosures (such as any you asked us to make). We will provide one accounting a year for free but will charge a reasonable, cost-based fee if you ask for another one within 12 months.
You have the right to file a complaint if you believe your privacy rights have been violated. You can contact the Facility’s Privacy Officer using the information on page 1 or you can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. We will not retaliate against you for filing a complaint.

Tweet-le Dumb or Media Rabbit Chasing
December 16, 2013 | Written by Christian Hine

Sen. Robert Rucho
The Panthers victory over the New York Jets and the Saints loss to the Rams wasn’t the only news being tweeted out across the Twitter-verse yesterday.
Appearing on the front page of the Charlotte Observer online today is the story of Senator Bob Rucho’s tweet yesterday morning that has ignited a Twitter war.
Depending on your perspective, it’s either an insulting and ignorant perspective on 75 years worth of history, or an insightful commentary on the excessive damage that our government is foisting on the American people.
The tweet reads as follows:
“Justice Robert’s pen & Obamacare has done more damage to the USA then the swords of the Nazis,Soviets & terrorists combined.”
That is certainly a bold statement, and at this point probably factually challengeable. Our nation lost millions of our citizens to the actions of the mentioned enemies. So far, this isn’t the case with Obamacare.
On the other hand, while we were able to defeat the scourge of the Nazis and the Soviet Empire, (I leave out terrorists on purpose…how does one defeat a tactic?), the ACA has been imposed on the American people by our own government and the research to date shows that the economic and medical suffering that will take place in the coming years (minus total reversal) will be hard hitting and long lasting.
So PunditHouse residents, was Rucho’s tweet a serious error in judgement warranting “Off with his head!” or is the media simply latching onto and sensationalizing a tweet that reconfirms the beliefs shared by many?

When Oz Breaks Down
December 10, 2013 | Written by Kayser Sosa
| Other Sources
We like to think the laws we have and the men and women of law enforcement protect us from devolving into a world of anarchy and chaos.
However, like most things we’re conditioned to believe, this is nothing more than a carefully crafted and perilously maintained illusion. An illusion that every once in a while allows us a glimpse of reality. We got such a glimpse earlier this week.
Cordoba City is the second-largest city in Argentina with roughly 1.5 million residents. It is a wealthy, modern and industrialized city.
On Tuesday, as described by local media, the city became ‘virtually paralyzed’ by chaos, riots and looting the moment it was announced local police had gone on strike. Amid massive looting by armed gangs, businesses large and small including banks and supermarkets closed their doors while citizens huddled in fear. Buses and other public transportation were shut down early on Wednesday, with officials citing fear of riders being harmed or mugged. Streets and store fronts were trashed, dozens of people were injured and one person was killed. Only after extracting a 52% (!!) raise did the police agree to go back to work.
Effectively, in the absence of police protection a major city turned into a lawless, barbaric mess. All in less than 24-hours.
So how many cops are we talking about? Six thousand. In a city of 1.5 million people. That’s one cop for every 250 people.
To put it another way, 15,000 people is one percent of the population. More than twice the number of cops. Three percent of the population is 45,000 people. More than 7 times the number of cops.
So do you really think it’s the security the cops provide that keep the peace on a daily basis? Or is it really just the illusion of security that keeps the peace? And what if the people one day realized it was all just an illusion? Would we need all the laws and the cops then? Would they be of any use at that point? Would the world fall apart or would cull the truly evil and live in peace with the common law?
And what if something really bad caused the people to riot on a day when the cops WERE on the job? If it was 1% of the population rioting do you think the cops could stop them? What if it was 3% of the people? Do you think, after a couple of hours of realizing they were outnumbered 7 to 1 they might throw down their badges and guns and go home to protect their own families? Or might they not only do that but at the same time demand that the politicians extract a 100% raise out of the taxpayers? Or why not a 500% raise?
Folks, we can give up every bit of our freedoms in the name of security. We can spend every dollar we have hiring more cops, putting cameras on every street corner, launching drones across the sky, installing metal detectors in every doorway, manning checkpoints all over the place, and putting armored vehicles and automatic weapons in the hands of every local police department. Not to mention the billions of rounds of ammo and thousands of handguns, rifles, and shotguns stockpiled by the Department of Homeland Security, the Post Office, the IRS and the like. But really, all we’re doing is reinforcing a lie while having ever more of our tax dollars squandered and more importantly, our liberties crushed in exchange for an illusion that will fall apart at the first signs of real trouble as it did in Cordoba City.
Who says so? The United States Supreme Court says so. In case after case, the SCOTUS has upheld the opinion that the police have no duty or responsibility to protect you or your property. None, zilch, nada. They are there to protect society at large. But even as we’ve just seen in a modern city they can’t even do that.
And yet, the police in Cordoba still wrangled the politicians into increasing their pay by over 50%. Folks, in my opinion that’s exhortation of the public purse and trust driven by one thing: fear. No different than a 1940s-style mafia gangster (or his modern-day equivalent, the urban “gangsta”) demanding “protection money” from the people and businesses on the block they control.
So my question is: If all of these laws and the people we hire to enforce them provide nothing more than an illusion of security while at the same time we’ve been told by the highest court in the land they have no duty to protect us, then why do we need them at all? Are we not, in the end, truly on our own, responsible for our own security and protection? And, if that is the case, why in the world would we, as a people, ever want to give away ANY of our liberties in exchange for a lie?
===================
Young liberal: Hey old man, why do you carry a gun?
Old man: ‘Cause carrying a cop would be too heavy.
Young liberal: But isn’t that gun dangerous?
Old man: Damn right it’s dangerous. If it wasn’t, what good would it be?

Lessons from the Swedish Model
Entrepreneurial spirit and motivation to work must be cherished like a national treasure; the Swedes lost their moral standing in their embrace of the welfare state
By Gustav von Hertzen
December 2, 2011
For some Americans clamoring to see the government take more active steps to take care of society with social initiatives and financial support programs, the Nordic countries may appear to be an attractive model of a welfare society, where the state is the omniscient provider of all the necessities and amenities of life. Based on a strong economy, Sweden’s Social Democrats were the first to introduce a policy of comprehensive welfare in the 1970s. By the turn of the century, the consequences of this had become apparent. Sweden was sliding in prosperity ranking, growth was lackluster, and the country suffered from the highest taxes in the world.
Finland has been keen to follow the example of its bigger neighbor, and publicly financed welfare is no exception. Whereas in Sweden a conservative government has succeeded in turning the tide, Finland is still drifting towards the dead end of economic malaise and public insolvency. My country should learn from the Swedish experience and change course in key policy areas; other nations should also heed the warnings Swedish failure has provided.
The most insidious effect of the welfare society is the slow erosion of what I call “moral capital.” It becomes manifest in the flight from individual and civic responsibility. Personal honesty is compromised in dealing with an all-pervasive administration. Mutual trust dissolves and entrepreneurship wanes. The very core of culture, the capability to play plus-sum games, is under threat. The free and responsible citizen turns into a passive government subject.
The well-nigh irresistible trend towards all-inclusive collective responsibility constitutes a serious challenge for affluent democracies. Economic disaster and the breakdown of society loom at the end of this road. The deeper we fall into the trap of socialism, the harder will be the climb back to a genuinely free and prosperous society.
A brief overview of the Swedish economy
In his publication The Swedish Model Reassessed, Nima Sanandaji outlines the development of the Swedish economy, beginning in the 1870s. Well into the following century, Sweden had one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The Social Democrats rose to power in 1935, but their political agenda remained moderate and growth-oriented for a long time.
A systematic increase in the tax rate began in the late 1960s; taxes were raised by approximately one percentage point per year. By 1985, the country had exceeded a tax rate of 50 percent of GDP, of which 30 percentage points were direct income tax. Sweden’s economic growth floundered, and employment increased only in the public sector.
In 2006, a conservative government stepped in. Taxes were cut to 43 percent of GDP by 2010, and the administration has become more entrepreneur-friendly. It is clear that Sweden’s old basic strengths still drive economic growth. Perhaps the most important factor is the Lutheran social morality, which, according to polling studies, declined steeply during the period between 1989 and 2004, but is now again on the rise.
Sanandaji focuses on comparing the living conditions in Sweden and the United States from a welfare perspective. The most interesting observation is the stability of the cultural foundations of the immigrant population of Swedish origin. In a sense, they have created a “Little Sweden” in their new home country. Within this population, unemployment and other social indicators are very close to the old home country. The only difference is an income level that is 53 percent higher on the other side of the Atlantic.
Cultural tradition as a success factor
Sweden’s success is dependent on a strong cultural tradition, or in other words, the moral capital of its citizens. It can endure high taxes-to a certain point- if the socioeconomic atmosphere is sufficiently motivating and discourages free riders. The tax rate in Sweden exceeded the critical level at the end of the past century, and progressive taxation could be crushing. This resulted in a reduced appetite for work and entrepreneurship.
An over-protective and restraining immigration policy has affected the cultural foundations of Sweden-for better and for worse. Immigrants from neighboring countries have adapted well, but many of those from farther away have dropped out of the economy. In the United States, immigrants have always been received with benevolent neglect. Non-interference has worked well, as everyone had to live up to the common work ethic.
What could other nations learn from the Swedish experience?
The first key message to take away is that entrepreneurial spirit and motivation to work must be cherished like a national treasure. The Swedes lost their moral standing in their embrace of the welfare state. In the beginning of the 1980s, over 80 percent of Swedes agreed with the statement “applying for public support fraudulently is never justified.” Two decades later, the number dropped to 55 percent; even sick leave had become an entitlement. The situation is now slowly improving.
Second, it is essential to keep public finances in good shape. Tax reductions should be preceded by expense cutting. Furthermore, sustainable welfare can only be based on an efficient and innovative economy. Productivity, competitiveness, and economic growth are easily trampled upon by politics. In such cases, the whole country enters a vicious downward spiral, typified by the near collapse of the Greek economy.
Third, renewing the general framework of the public economy should be done without prejudice. Only genuine competition ensures good service and exemplary operations. This can be achieved, for example, through the extensive use of vouchers for public services, but a prerequisite for outsourcing is that private service companies are allowed to compete on a level playing field.
Fourth, immigrants should be integrated into working life as quickly as possible. Instead of being patronized, they should be put to work. For many immigrants, the only competitive advantage is a strong determination to work, even for a low salary. This should be legalized. The alternative is permanent exclusion or a gray labor market and relentless exploitation.
Finally, the affluence and welfare of a country depends on the innovativeness and self-reliance of the citizens. Only free citizens can take responsibility for themselves and take part in building a genuine civil society. The state simply maintains the essential framework for the joint efforts of free individuals. Unfortunately, legislation and bureaucracy have an innate tendency to expand beyond any reasonable bounds.
The creative energy of citizens must not be restrained, entrepreneurship should not be hampered, and the self-reliance of independent citizens must not be suppressed by excessive care and control. Vital moral capital is built slowly, piece by piece, but it may erode much more quickly.

Our Point of View on the occasion of the COP 23
In News And Views by admin October 4, 2017 2 Comments
Our Point of View on the occasion of the COP 23
Today we are on track for global warming of 2.8°C or even up to 4°C, with the risk catastrophic climate breakdown. And World Leaders still have no plan in place to reduce CO2 to the levels that they agreed to.
World leaders, meeting in Paris in December 2015 at a meeting called COP21 (1), signed an agreement to manage Climate Change. At this meeting, they committed to holding the global temperature to “well below 2°C” above pre-industrial levels, to pursue efforts to limit the warming to 1.5°C, and to do this by reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. The parties who signed the Paris Agreement are again assembling in Bonn (COP23, 6 to 17 November 2017) to reaffirm their commitment to combat climate change and reassess the adequacy of their response to the threat. There is a mismatch between the agreed-upon goal and the commitments, in the form of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), that the parties made to achieve the goal.
As of September 2017, 1°C of global warming has already taken place, and even if the NDCs are met, the planet would be on track for at least 2.8°C of global warming or more, risking catastrophic climate change. This means that the current NDCs provide no assurance against catastrophic climate change. Obviously, if the NDCs are not met, the global warming will be even higher.
CO2 levels are monitored all the time at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Figures from Mauna Loa Hawaii for May 2017 are 409.65 parts per million (ppm) compared to 407.70 ppm in May 2016 and 403.96 in May 2015. This is over 40% higher than in 1750, before the industrial revolution, when CO2 was about 280 ppm. But the biggest problem is that CO2 ppm is still increasing, by around 2 ppm each year.
Saving Our Planet calls upon the Conference of the Parties (COP23) to:
Revise and readjust their commitments (NDCs) upward so that they represent a real (over 67%) probability of limiting global warming to 1.5° to 1.8° C above preindustrial levels;
Given the urgency of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, evaluate technology toward this goal on the basis of the best available scientific knowledge, avoiding political pressure, prejudice, and any influences not relevant to this objective;
Implement a system of frequent periodic validation of actual results to clearly show the evolution of GHG emissions and compare them with stated goals. The information should be kept up to date and publicly available. This will show whether countries are on course to meet their objectives, and help to avoid becoming locked into bad decisions and ineffective technology.
Some suggestions for climate action:
Introducing charges for CO2 – even if initially at a low level – and putting all the proceeds towards incentives to fight climate change.
Requiring countries to immediately remove all subsidies from coal, gas and oil and instead to use the funding to fight climate change.
Implementing tree-planting on an epic scale – particularly around destroyed forests.
Providing easy access to voluntary birth control, and refraining from policies that encourage large families. Global human population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 3 billion in 1960 and 7.5 billion today, and continues to grow. Every additional person contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and to deforestation (as land is cleared for urban development or agriculture).
Informing the public about climate change: the threat, what is being done, what needs to be done, and how everyone can play a part.
We deplore the USA’s unfortunate decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. We trust that other countries will not see in this lack of solidarity an excuse to weaken their own commitments, but rather a reason to reinforce their efforts if necessary to fill the gap.
This is an URGENT call for action. Barack Obama said we are the last generation who can do something about climate change. Time is running out, because Greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere all the time. The longer we leave it, the more difficult and more expensive it will be to get back to safe levels. And the higher the temperature, the higher the risk of triggering irreversible climate change – such as the release of huge quantities of methane currently frozen in permafrost in the tundra of Northern Russia, Canada and Alaska. 2018 is fast emerging as the last chance to get global warming back on track to well below 2°C.
Saving Our Planet is launching our own campaign to take the message about climate change to the general public: N0CO2 – Giving people the power to take action and join in building a community to reduce and remove CO2 and fight climate change: www.n0co2.org

This is real splendid !
A pity that population reduction is not a major target for you
Without it, you simply cannot achieve your other goals.

Climate change is fast aheading to adversely affect human life on plant earth. This calls for drastic actions on the part of each individual to contain the emmissision co2 and adopt life styles that are totally eco friendly. It is high time awareness level of global warming is raised and harmony with nature is ensured.

Who else is on the ballot: Races for governor, AG, U.S. Senate

The Nov. 6 ballot features a bevy of contests in addition to the prominent race for the 1st Congressional District seat.
Here’s a quick rundown of who’s who.
Governor
• Andrew Cuomo (Democrat, Working Family, Independence, Women’s Equity)
• Marc Molinaro (Republican, Conservative, Reform)
• Howie Hawkins (Green)
• Stephanie Miner (Libertarian)
Mr. Cuomo is the incumbent, having been governor since 2011. An attorney, he was also the state’s attorney general from 2007 to 2010. His late father, Mario, was governor of New York from 1983 to 1994. Mr. Cuomo is running with Kathy Hochul as the lieutenant governor. Mr. Cuomo says the state “needs a governor who will stand up to” President Donald Trump. Gun safety, women’s equality and protecting the environment are among the issues he says he has targeted.
Mr. Molinaro is the Dutchess County executive and was mayor of Tivoli, N.Y., when he was 19.
He has criticized the state’s “crushing tax burden” and “culture of corruption” under Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Molinaro has proposed plans he says will fix both of those issues. He is running with Julie Killian as lieutenant governor.
U.S. Senate
• Kirsten Gillibrand (D, WF, I, WE)
• Chele Farley (R, C, Reform)
Ms. Gillibrand has been a U.S. senator since January 2009, when she was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Clinton, who became Secretary of State.
She served previously as a congresswoman from the Albany area.
Ms. Gillibrand says she is “fighting back against President Trump’s dangerous, discriminatory agenda in Washington” and opposes “any efforts to cut the Social Security and Medicare benefits seniors have earned.”
Ms. Farley, a private equity executive, says New York isn’t getting its fair share from Washington and says there should be term limits “because career politicians spend too much time fighting over partisan issues.”
State Comptroller
• Thomas DiNapoli (D, WF, I, WE, Reform)
• Jonathan Trichter (R, C)
• Mark Dunlea (Green)
• Cruger Gallaudet (Libertarian)
Mr. DiNapoli, who is from Great Neck Plaza in Nassau County, was elected state comptroller Feb. 7, 2007, after having been a state assemblyman since 1987. In 1972, he was elected to the Mineola school board at the age of 18.
Mr. Trichter is an investment banker and specializes in public finance.
Attorney General
• Letitia James (D, WF, I)
• Keith Wofford (R, C)
• Michael Sussman (Green)
• Nancy Sliwa (Reform)
• Christopher Garvey (Libertarian)
The candidates are running to fill a seat left vacant by the resignation of Democrat Eric Schneiderman earlier this year amid sex abuse accusations. His deputy, Barbara Underwood, has filled in for the remainder of his term, but said she doesn’t plan to run.
Ms. James, an attorney, is currently the New York City Public Advocate, an elected position.
Mr. Wofford is an attorney making his first run for public office.
County Clerk
• DuWayne Gregory (D)
• Judith Pascale (R, C, I, Reform)
• Debra Brown (WF)
Ms. Pascale was first elected county clerk in 2006.
Mr. Gregory is currently a Suffolk County legislator and has twice run unsuccessfully for Congress. He is currently the Legislature’s presiding officer.
County Comptroller
• Jay Schneiderman (D, Protect the Taxpayers, WF, WE)
• John Kennedy (R, C, I, Reform)
Mr. Kennedy, a former county legislator for 10 years, has been Suffolk County’s comptroller since 2015, having been elected in 2014.
Mr. Schneiderman is currently the Southampton Town supervisor, having taken office in 2016. Before that, he was a Suffolk County legislator from the South Fork from 2004 to 2015, and also served as East Hampton Town supervisor from 2000 to 2004. He will retain his supervisor seat if he loses the comptroller race.
Various judicial positions are on the ballot as well. Judges are prohibited from campaigning in the same manner as those running for policy-making positions.

Physician Star Rating Description
Each patient's experience at our practice is important to us. As we strive to provide the highest level of care, we value feedback on all aspects of the patient experience. This MedicalGPS patient experience survey measures patient satisfaction from the time the appointment was made to the time the patient spent with the provider.
Visit Preparation: Measures how courteous, respectful and friendly the clinical staff was during the patient's visit.
Provider Listened: Measures how carefully the provider listens to the needs of each and every patient.
Office Wait Time: Measures how satisfied the patient was with wait time during their visit.
Patient Recommendation: Measures how likely the patient is to recommend this practice to family and friends.

Provider Listened: Measures how carefully the provider listens to the needs of each and every patient.
Office Wait Time: Measures how satisfied the patient was with wait time during their visit.

Advanced and emerging economies have made progress in addressing climate change, yet most are on a trajectory that would see them fall short of their mitigation goals. Governments need to significantly accelerate their efforts and strengthen their climate change policies, according to a new OECD analysis of climate change mitigation in 44 countries and the EU.

In an effort to reduce pollution, the government tried two policy prescriptions under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The first—command and control—mandated that each power plant lower its pollution by a determined amount. However, different firms face different cost curves and, because information is dispersed, policymakers don’t always know those costs. The second policy prescription—tradable pollution permits—empowered firms to use knowledge of their cost curves to buy or sell pollution permits as needed. Under this policy, the invisible hand of the market helped discover the lowest cost way of reducing pollution.

Ted Gayer: There are easy policies that can be proposed that aren't as effective as others. A cap-and-trade or acarbon tax program would set a price on carbon and send the proper incentives through the market to successfully reduce emissions.

Philip Wallach, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, explains that there continues to be no consensus in U.S. domestic politics around the Paris Agreement and policies to address emissions. https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-future-of-the-paris-agreement-and-global-climate-change-cooperation-without-u-s-leadership/ On June 6, the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate hosted a conversation on what President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement means going forward.

So, if economics is about choices and how we use our resources, econ probably has a lot to say about the environment, right? Right! In simple terms, pollution is just a market failure. The market is producing more pollution than society wants. This week, Adriene and Jacob focus on the environment, and how economics can be used to control and reduce pollution and emissions. You'll learn about supply and demand, incentives, and how government intervention influences the environment. Crash Course is on Patreon!

Outside of countries’ core climate policies, many of the regulatory features of today’s economies have been built around the availability of fossil fuels and without any regard for the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from human activities. This report makes a diagnosis of these contradictions and points to means of solving them to support a more effective transition of all countries to a low-carbon economy.

Crash Course
Crash Course (also known as Driving Academy) is a 1988 made for television teen film directed by Oz Scott.
Plot
Crash Course centers on a group of high schoolers in a driver’s education class; many for the second or third time. The recently divorced teacher, super-passive Larry Pearl, is on thin ice with the football fanatic principal, Principal Paulson, who is being pressured by the district superintendent to raise driver’s education completion rates or lose his coveted football program. With this in mind, Principal Paulson and his assistant, with a secret desire for his job, Abner Frasier, hire an outside driver’s education instructor with a very tough reputation, Edna Savage, aka E.W. Savage, who quickly takes control of the class.
The plot focuses mostly on the students and their interactions with their teachers and each other. In the beginning, Rico is the loner with just a few friends, Chadley is the bookish nerd with few friends who longs to be cool and also longs to be a part of Vanessa’s life who is the young, friendly and attractive girl who had to fake her mother’s signature on her driver’s education permission slip. Kichi is the hip-hop Asian kid who often raps what he has to say and constantly flirts with Maria, the rich foreign girl who thinks that the right-of-way on the roadways always goes to (insert awesomely fake foreign Latino accent) “my father’s limo”. Finally you have stereotypical football meathead J.J., who needs to pass his English exam to keep his eligibility and constantly asks out and gets rejected by Alice, the tomboy whose father owns “Santini & Son” Concrete Company. Alice is portrayed as being the “son” her father wanted.

Crash Course (YouTube)
Crash Course (sometimes stylized as CrashCourse) is an educational YouTube channel started by the Green brothers, Hank Green and John Green, who are notable for their VlogBrothers channel. Originally, John and Hank presented humanities and science courses to viewers, respectively, although the series has since expanded to incorporate courses by additional hosts.
Crash Course was one of the 100 initial channels of YouTube's $100 million original channel initiative. Crash Course launched a preview on December 2, 2011. As of February 14, 2016, the Crash Course YouTube channel has gotten 3,947,842 subscribers and has received over 300 million video views. In November 2014, Hank Green announced that a partnership with PBS Digital Studios would allow them to produce more courses, starting in January 2015.
Currently there are fourteen seasons of Crash Course, with Hank and John each hosting five. Together with Emily Graslie, they co-hosted Big History. As part of the PBS partnership, Phil Plait and Craig Benzine have hosted series about Astronomy and U.S. Government and Politics, respectively. A second channel, Crash Course Kids, is hosted by Sabrina Cruz and has started its first series, Science.

Crash Course (game show)
Crash Course is an American game show that premiered on ABC on August 26, 2009. It is hosted by Orlando Jones and Dan Cortese. The series has teams of two competing for a golden steering wheel and $50,000. The series was aimed to try and outbest Wipeout, but failed to beat its audience and has been canceled after three aired episodes (but four were produced).
Premise
Hosted by Orlando Jones and Dan Cortese. Five teams of two are revealed at the beginning (Siblings, Mother-Son, Best Friends, Single Moms, Roommates, Neighbors etc.). The first round has all five teams competing, for example, in car bowling, the team with the lowest amount of pins would be eliminated.
For round two, the four teams would tackle an even more difficult challenge, another example, in Catch Me If You Can, the teams would fight through barrels to get up on a platform. Some cars don't make it and fall upside-down sometimes. The team who doesn't make it up as far or with the slowest time is eliminated.

Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important trace gas in Earth's atmosphere currently constituting about 0.04% (400 parts per million) of the atmosphere. Each part per million by volume represents approximately 2.13 gigatonnes of carbon in the atmosphere as a whole. Despite its relatively small concentration, CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas and plays a vital role in regulating Earth's surface temperature through radiative forcing and the greenhouse effect. Reconstructions show that concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere have varied, ranging from as high as 7,000 parts per million during the Cambrian period about 500 million years ago to as low as 180 parts per million during the Quaternary glaciation of the last two million years.
Carbon dioxide is an integral part of the carbon cycle, a biogeochemical cycle in which carbon is exchanged between the Earth's oceans, soil, rocks and biosphere. The present biosphere of Earth is dependent on atmospheric CO2 for its existence. Plants and other photoautotrophs use solar energy to synthesize carbohydrate from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. Carbohydrate derived from consumption of plants as food is the primary source of energy and carbon compounds in almost all other organisms.

Trading Pollution: How Pollution Permits Paradoxically Reduce Emissions
Trading Pollution: How Pollution Permits Paradoxically Reduce Emissions
In an effort to reduce pollution, the government tried two policy prescriptions under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The first—command and control—mandated that each power plant lower its pollution by a determined amount. However, different firms face different cost curves and, because information is dispersed, policymakers don’t always know those costs. The second policy prescription—tradable pollution permits—empowered firms to use knowledge of their cost curves to buy or sell pollution permits as needed. Under this policy, the invisible hand of the market helped discover the lowest cost way of reducing pollution.

Using AVERT to Estimate the Emissions Benefits of Clean Energy Policies and Programs (6.1.2015)
Using AVERT to Estimate the Emissions Benefits of Clean Energy Policies and Programs (6.1.2015)
Using AVERT to Estimate the Emissions Benefits of Clean Energy Policies and Programs (6.1.2015)
State policymakers and various stakeholders frequently have need to estimate the emissions impacts of particular renewable energy and energy efficiency policies. However, it can be challenging and expensive to quantify those impacts. AVERT, a new tool that was built for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by Synapse Energy Economics can ease this task. It is a free, open-access tool that estimates the hourly emissions and generation benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy policies and programs. AVERT allows non-expert users to quantify displaced emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOX, and avoided generation mitigated by state or multi-state programs. Stakeholders and regulators can also use the tool to identify likely units and regions impacted by different efficiency or renewable energy programs. The webinar described and demonstrated AVERT. For more information about AVERT, see https://www.epa.gov/avert/. Presenters: - Robyn DeYoung, State Climate and Energy Program Manager, US EPA - Jeremy Fisher, Principal Associate, Synapse Energy Economics Slides from this webinar are available as a pdf at https://www.cesa.org/assets/Uploads/RPS-webinar-slides-6.1.15.pdf This webinar was a presentation of the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA)'s State Federal RPS Collaborative.

So, if economics is about choices and how we use our resources, econ probably has a lot to say about the environment, right? Right! In simple terms, pollution is just a market failure. The market is producing more pollution than society wants. This week, Adriene and Jacob focus on the environment, and how economics can be used to control and reduce pollution and emissions.

State policymakers and various stakeholders frequently have need to estimate the emissions impacts of particular renewable energy and energy efficiency policies. However, it can be challenging and expensive to quantify those impacts. AVERT, a new tool that was built for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by Synapse Energy Economics can ease this task. It is a free, open-access tool that estimates the hourly emissions and generation benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy policies and programs. AVERT allows non-expert users to quantify displaced emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOX, and avoided generation mitigated by state or multi-state programs. Stakeholders and regulators can also use the tool to identify likely units and regions impacted by different efficiency or renewable energy programs. The webinar described and demonstrated AVERT. For more information about AVERT, see https://www.epa.gov/avert/. Presenters: - Robyn DeYoung, State Climate and Energy Program Manager, US EPA - Jeremy Fisher, Principal Associate, Synapse Energy Economics Slides from this webinar are available as a pdf at https://www.cesa.org/assets/Uploads/RPS-webinar-slides-6.1.15.pdf This webinar was a presentation of the Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA)'s State Federal RPS Collaborative.

Advanced and emerging economies have made progress in addressing climate change, yet most are on a trajectory that would see them fall short of their mitigation goals. Governments need to significantly accelerate their efforts and strengthen their climate change policies, according to a new OECD analysis of climate change mitigation in 44 countries and the EU.

In an effort to reduce pollution, the government tried two policy prescriptions under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The first—command and control—mandated that each power plant lower its pollution by a determined amount. However, different firms face different cost curves and, because information is dispersed, policymakers don’t always know those costs. The second policy prescription—tradable pollution permits—empowered firms to use knowledge of their cost curves to buy or sell pollution permits as needed. Under this policy, the invisible hand of the market helped discover the lowest cost way of reducing pollution.

Crash Course
Crash Course (also known as Driving Academy) is a 1988 made for television teen film directed by Oz Scott.
Plot
Crash Course centers on a group of high schoolers in a driver’s education class; many for the second or third time. The recently divorced teacher, super-passive Larry Pearl, is on thin ice with the football fanatic principal, Principal Paulson, who is being pressured by the district superintendent to raise driver’s education completion rates or lose his coveted football program. With this in mind, Principal Paulson and his assistant, with a secret desire for his job, Abner Frasier, hire an outside driver’s education instructor with a very tough reputation, Edna Savage, aka E.W. Savage, who quickly takes control of the class.
The plot focuses mostly on the students and their interactions with their teachers and each other. In the beginning, Rico is the loner with just a few friends, Chadley is the bookish nerd with few friends who longs to be cool and also longs to be a part of Vanessa’s life who is the young, friendly and attractive girl who had to fake her mother’s signature on her driver’s education permission slip. Kichi is the hip-hop Asian kid who often raps what he has to say and constantly flirts with Maria, the rich foreign girl who thinks that the right-of-way on the roadways always goes to (insert awesomely fake foreign Latino accent) “my father’s limo”. Finally you have stereotypical football meathead J.J., who needs to pass his English exam to keep his eligibility and constantly asks out and gets rejected by Alice, the tomboy whose father owns “Santini & Son” Concrete Company. Alice is portrayed as being the “son” her father wanted.

Krystal Whipple Has Been Arrested for Allegedly Killing Her Manicurist
On: January 13, 2019
In: News
Things took an unexpected and deadly turn for 51-year-old Nhu “Annie” Ngoc Quynh Nguyen when Krystal Whipple walked in for a manicure at her salon, Crystal Nails and Spa, in Las Vegas on December 29, 2018. At the end of the service, Whipple produced a credit card to pay her $35 bill but the card was declined.
According to a report from BuzzFeed News, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department revealed that Whipple claimed she had cash in her car and needed to go outside to retrieve it. Upon hearing this, Nguyen — a mother of three — followed the customer to ensure that she would make the payment.

Senator Lindsey Graham Moves to Block House Mueller Resolution
posted by Bill Strange - Mar 15, 2019
Senator Lindsey Graham is attempting to temporarily block the House resolution that calls for Special Counsel Robert Mueller report to be made public. Earlier today, the House voted 420-to-0 in favor of the measure to release information on Russian meddling during the 2016 election. Speaking today on Capitol Hill, the South Carolina Republican says he wants to add another special counsel to investigate the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Graham also wants the special counsel to investigate the abuse of the FISA warrant process against President Trump's former campaign adviser Carter Page.

Early life[edit]
Carrey was born in the Toronto suburb of Newmarket, Ontario, Canada,[1] to Kathleen (née Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, a musician and accountant.[3][4] He was raised a Roman Catholic and has three older siblings: John, Patricia, and Rita.[5][6] His mother was of French, Irish, and Scottish descent and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry (the family's original surname was Carré).[7][8][9]
At age 10, Carrey wrote a letter to Carol Burnett of the Carol Burnett Show pointing out that he was already a master of impressions and should be considered for a role on the show; he was overjoyed when he received a form letter reply.[10]
Carrey lived in Scarborough, Ontario (in a small building next to a wheel factory and attended Grade 10 at Agincourt Collegiate Institute),[11] North York (attended Blessed Trinity Catholic Elementary School) and Burlington, Ontario for eight years, and attended Aldershot High School. In a Hamilton Spectator interview (February 2007), Carrey said, "If my career in show business hadn't panned out I would probably be working today in Hamilton, Ontario, at the Dofasco steel mill." When looking across the Burlington Bay toward Hamilton, he could see the mills and thought, "Those were where the great jobs were."[12]
Career[edit]
Early work[edit]
While Carrey was struggling to obtain work and make a name for himself, his father tried to help the young comedian put together a stage act, driving him to Toronto to debut at comedy club Yuk Yuk's.[13] Carrey's impersonations bombed and this gave him doubts about his capabilities as a professional entertainer. His family's financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey's ambitions.[citation needed]
Eventually, the family's financial problems were resolved and they moved into a new home.[13] With more domestic stability, Carrey returned to the stage with a more polished act. In a short period of time, he went from open-mic nights to regular paid shows, building his reputation in the process. A reviewer in the Toronto Star raved that Carrey was "a genuine star coming to life".[14] Carrey was soon noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who signed the young comic to open his tour performances. Dangerfield eventually brought Carrey to Las Vegas. However, Carrey soon decided to move to Hollywood, where he began performing at The Comedy Store and, in 1982, appeared on the televised stand-up show An Evening at the Improv.[15] The following year, he debuted his act on The Tonight Show.[16]
Despite his increasing popularity as a stand-up comic, Carrey turned his attention to the film and television industries, auditioning to be a cast member for the 1980–81 season of NBC's Saturday Night Live. Carrey was not selected for the position, although he later hosted the show in May 1996, January 2011, and October 2014.[17][18] In 1984, Carrey was in the short-lived sitcom The Duck Factory.[19]
From 1990 to 1994, Carrey was a regular cast member of the ensemble comedy television series In Living Color.[20]
1994–1997: Rise to fame[edit]
Carrey played the lead roles in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber (both 1994).[21] Dumb and Dumber was a commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide,[22] He received his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor for his work in The Mask.
Carrey in Madrid, Spain, on December 13, 2008
Carrey portrayed the Batman villain The Riddler in the Joel Schumacher-directed superhero film Batman Forever (1995). The film received mixed reviews, but was a box office success. He reprised his role as Ace Ventura in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls which was also released in 1995. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but poorly received by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212 million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40 million opening weekend.[23]
Carrey earned $20 million for his next film, The Cable Guy (1996). Directed by Ben Stiller, the film was a satirical black comedy, in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by Matthew Broderick). The role was a departure from the "hapless, hyper, overconfident" characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting to Carrey's change of tone from previous films.[24] Carrey also starred in the music video of the film's closing song, "Leave Me Alone" by Jerry Cantrell.[25] Despite the reviews, The Cable Guy grossed $102 million worldwide.[26]
He soon bounced back with the critically acclaimed comedy Liar Liar (1997), playing Fletcher Reede, an unethical lawyer rendered unable to lie by his young son’s birthday wish. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said: "Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally turns up in a straightforward comic vehicle, and the results are much wilder and funnier than this mundane material should have allowed."[27]
1998–2006: Critical acclaim[edit]
The following year he decided to take a pay cut to play the serious role of Truman Burbank in the satirical comedy-drama film The Truman Show (1998).[28] The film was highly praised and brought Carrey further international acclaim, leading many to believe he would be nominated for an Oscar.[29] Eventually, he did pick up his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama. The Truman Show was a commercial success also, earning $264 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million.[30][31]
A Film4 critic stated that the film "allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy", adding that it was "a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire".[32]
That same year, Carrey appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on the final episode of Garry Shandling's The Larry Sanders Show, in which he deliberately ripped into Shandling's character. In 1999, Carrey had the lead role in Man on the Moon. He portrayed comedian Andy Kaufman to critical acclaim and received his second Golden Globe in a row. In addition, he received his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Actor.[33]
In 2000, Carrey reteamed with the Farrelly brothers, who had previously directed him in Dumb and Dumber, for the black comedy film Me, Myself & Irene, a film that received mixed reviews[34] but enjoyed box office success. Carrey played the role of state trooper Charlie Baileygates, who has multiple personalities and romances a woman portrayed by Renée Zellweger. That same year, Carrey starred in the second highest-grossing Christmas film of all time, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, playing the title character, for which he received both praise and criticism from critics alongside a Golden Globe nomination.[35]
For his next feature film, Carrey starred opposite Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman in Tom Shadyac's international hit comedy Bruce Almighty (2003). Carrey played a TV newsman who unexpectedly receives God's omnipotent abilities when the deity decides to take a vacation. The film received mixed reviews upon release[36] but despite this still became a financial success, earning over $484 million worldwide, and going on to become the seventeenth highest-grossing live action comedy of all time.[37][38]
In 2004, Carrey starred in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The film received overwhelming acclaim upon release. Critics highly praised Carrey's portrayal of Joel Barish, in addition to the performance of his co-star Kate Winslet, who received an Oscar nomination. According to CNN's reviewer Paul Clinton, Carrey's performance was the actor's "best, most mature and sharply focused performance ever".[39] Carrey received another Golden Globe nomination and his first BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actor.
Carrey at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival
Carrey's next appearance was in the 2004 black comedy fantasy film Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, which was based on the popular children's novels of the same name. The film was positively received; Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said of Carrey's approach to the character of Count Olaf,
Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur.[40][41]
That same year, Carrey was inducted into the Canadian Walk of Fame.[42]
2007–present[edit]
Carrey reunited with Joel Schumacher, director of Batman Forever, for The Number 23 (2007), a psychological thriller co-starring Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston. In the film, Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with the number 23, after finding a book about a man with the same obsession. The film was panned by critics. The following year Carrey provided his voice for Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! (2008). Carrey voiced the beloved elephant for the CGI-animated feature, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews and delivered family crowds en masse. The film was also a box office success, raking in over $290 million worldwide.[43]
Carrey returned to live-action comedy, starring opposite Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper in Yes Man (also 2008). Carrey played a man who signs up for a self-help program that teaches him to say yes to everything. Despite reviews being mixed, Rene Rodriquez of The Miami Herald stated, "Yes Man is fine as far as Jim Carrey comedies go, but it's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh."[44] The film had a decent performance at the box office, earning $225 million worldwide.[45]
Since 2009, Carrey's work has included a leading role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's I Love You Phillip Morris, premiering in January 2009 at the Sundance Film Festival before receiving a wide release in February 2010. Carrey portrayed Steven Jay Russell, a con artist, imposter, and multiple prison escapee who falls in love with his fellow inmate, Phillip Morris (played by Ewan McGregor). The film received largely positive reviews, with Damon Wise of The Times giving the film four stars out of five, stating, "I Love You Phillip Morris is an extraordinary film that serves as a reminder of just how good Carrey can be when he's not tied into a generic Hollywood crowd-pleaser. His comic timing remains as exquisite as ever."[46]
Carrey walking in to the Ed Sullivan Theater, venue for the Late Show with David Letterman, in 2010
For the first time in his career, Carrey portrayed multiple characters in Disney's 3D animated take on the classic Charles Dickens tale, A Christmas Carol (2009), voicing Ebenezer Scrooge and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film also starred Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Colin Firth, Gary Oldman, and Cary Elwes. The film received decent reviews and was a financial success. Carrey landed the lead role in Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011), playing Thomas "Tom" Popper Jr. a realtor who becomes the caretaker of a family of penguins. The film received a mixed reception upon release.[47]
He starred alongside former co-star Steve Carell in the Don Scardino-directed comedy film The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013). Carrey played Steve Gray, a dangerous street magician who overshadows the formerly successful magician Burt Wonderstone (played by Carell). The film was released in March 2013 to mixed reviews and underperformed significantly at the box office, grossing just over $27 million on a $30 million budget.[48]
Around the same time, he appeared in Kick-Ass 2 (also 2013) as Colonel Stars and Stripes. He retracted support for the film two months prior to its release. He issued a statement via his Twitter account that, in light of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary, "Now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence."[49]
Peter Farrelly said in April 2012 that Carrey and Jeff Daniels would return for a Dumb and Dumber sequel, Dumb and Dumber To, with the Farrelly brothers writing and directing and a planned September 2012 production start.[50] In June, however, Carrey's representative said Carrey had left the project because the comedian felt New Line and Warner Bros. were unenthusiastic toward it.[51] However, on October 1, 2012, Yahoo!'s "The Yo Show" carried the news item that the script was complete and that the original actors, Carrey and Daniels, would be reprising their roles. The plot involved one of the characters having sired a child and needing to find them in order to obtain a kidney.[52][53] Dumb and Dumber To was released in November 2014.
In March 2013, Carrey announced that he had written a children's book titled How Roland Rolls, about a scared wave named Roland. He described it as "kind of a metaphysical children's story, which deals with a lot of heavy stuff in a really childish way." Carrey self-published the book, which was released in September 2013.[54][55]
On March 25, 2013, Carrey released a parody music video with Eels through Funny or Die, with Carrey replacing Mark Oliver Everett on vocals. The song and video, titled "Cold Dead Hand" and set as a musical act during the variety program Hee Haw, lampoons American gun culture, and specifically former NRA spokesperson Charlton Heston.[56]
Carrey delivered the commencement address at Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, in May 2014 and received an honorary doctorate for his achievements as a comedian, artist, author, and philanthropist.[57]
Carrey was a producer on Rubble Kings, a 2015 documentary film that depicts events preceding and following the Hoe Avenue peace meeting.[58]
On August 29, 2014, Carrey was honored by Canada Post with a limited-edition postage stamp with his portrait on it.[59]
In June 2017 Showtime began airing the dramedy I'm Dying Up Here, for which Carrey served as the executive producer. The show, which chronicles a group of stand-up comics in 1970s Los Angeles, incorporates aspects of Carrey's own experience.[60] In September of that year, that same network announced that he would be starring in a comedy series titled Kidding, which will reunite Carrey and director Michel Gondry.[61] By the end of 2017, it was announced that Catherine Keener would star opposite Carrey in Kidding.[62]
Carrey was also the subject of two documentaries in 2017. The first, a short subject entitled I Needed Color about his lifelong passion for art, was released online in the summer.[63] Later that year another documentary, Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton, premiered at The Venice Film Festival and was later picked up by Netflix.[64] The film chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama during the shooting of Man on the Moon, when he never broke character as Andy Kaufman.[65] It incorporates footage that was shot for the film's electronic press kit[65] but ultimately pulled by Universal as they felt that it was too damaging.[66]
Personal life[edit]
Health[edit]
Carrey suffers from depression[67] and has taken Prozac to deal with it. He has stated that he no longer takes medications or stimulants of any kind, including coffee.[67]
Relationships[edit]
Carrey with his family at the Horton Hears a Who! premiere in 2008
Carrey has been married twice. His first marriage was to former actress and Comedy Store waitress Melissa Womer, whom he married on March 28, 1987. Their daughter, Jane Erin Carrey, was born September 6, 1987.[68] Jane was a 2012 contestant on American Idol.[69] Carrey and Womer divorced in 1995.[70]
A year later, on September 23, 1996, Carrey married his Dumb and Dumber co-star Lauren Holly; the marriage lasted less than a year.[71] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Carrey had a much-publicized, short-lived romance with his Me, Myself and Irene co-star Renée Zellweger, to whom he was engaged from 1999 to 2000.[72]
Carrey met model and actress Jenny McCarthy in 2005 and made their relationship public in June 2006. In April 2010, the two ended their relationship.[73] Despite the split and media circulations, in October 2010 McCarthy said, "Jim and I are still good friends".[74]
On September 28, 2015, Carrey's former girlfriend Cathriona White, a native of County Tipperary, Ireland, was found dead from a prescription drug overdose. The couple first met in 2012.[75][76] Carrey was a pallbearer at her funeral in Cappawhite.[77]
On September 19, 2016, Mark Burton, White's husband from 2013 until her death, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey, claiming that he had used his "immense wealth and celebrity status" to illegally obtain and distribute prescription drugs involved in her death. Carrey released a statement the following day:
What a terrible shame. It would be easy for me to get in a back room with this man's lawyer and make this go away, but there are some moments in life when you have to stand up and defend your honor against the evil in this world. I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman I loved. Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic end was beyond anyone's control. I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.[78][79]
In October 2016, White's mother, Brigid Sweetman, also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey.[80] In this suit, Sweetman's attorney states that Carrey underwent a test for sexually transmitted infections and "purposely hid the results from Ms. White, whom he was intimately involved with, and failed to inform her that he had tested positive for hepatitis A, HSV (herpes) I and II, and chlamydia. To make matters worse, Carrey then proceeded to have unprotected sex with Ms. White with full knowledge that he was STD positive."[81] Sweetman herself later issued a statement: "These documents show that Jim Carrey has lied to the media, the public and the court. Carrey has now been shown for what he is — a dishonest Hollywood celebrity who thinks he can say anything and fool people just because he is famous."[81] The lawsuit was dismissed on January 25, 2018, and attorneys for both sides confirmed there would be no further legal proceedings.[82][83] Almost a year later, Carrey attended Golden Globes 2019 Party with his new girlfriend Ginger Gonzaga in January 2019, as an expression of a romantic relationship.[84][85]
Citizenship[edit]
Carrey received U.S. citizenship in October 2004 and remains a dual citizen of the United States and his native Canada.[86]
Beliefs[edit]
Carrey believes the MMR vaccine causes autism. In 2009, Carrey wrote an article questioning the merits of vaccination and vaccine research for The Huffington Post.[87] With former partner Jenny McCarthy, Carrey led a "Green Our Vaccines" march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of toxic substances from children's vaccines, out of a belief that children had received "too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic".[88] The rally was criticized by David Gorski, an American surgical oncologist on Science-Based Medicine blog for being anti-vaccine, not "pro-safe vaccine"[89] and by Steven Parker on WebMD website for being "irresponsible".[90]
On July 1, 2015, after the signing of a new vaccination law, Carrey called California Governor Jerry Brown a "corporate fascist" who was poisoning children by enacting the vaccination requirements.[91] The law disallowed religious and philosophical reasons for exemption from vaccination. Carrey was criticized for being "ignorant when it comes to vaccines" by Arthur Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics, at New York University,[92] and by Jeffrey Kluger, senior writer at Time, who described his anti-vaccination statements as "angry, dense and immune to reason".[93]
Carrey believes in and advocates for the so-called "law of attraction". In an interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 17, 1997,[94] he revealed that as a struggling actor he would use visualization techniques to get work. He also stated that he visualized a $10,000,000 check given to him for "acting services rendered", placed the check in his pocket, and seven years later received a $10,000,000 check for his role in Dumb and Dumber.[95]
Carrey practices Transcendental Meditation.[96][97]
Carrey has been showing his own political cartoon drawings since August 2017, including controversial renderings of White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and President Donald Trump.[98] His show titled "IndigNation" opened on October 23, 2018 at the Maccarone Gallery in Los Angeles and features 108 pen-and-ink drawings from Carrey's Twitter feed from 2016-2018.[99]

2. Newmarket, Ontario – Newmarket is a town and regional seat of the Regional Municipality of York in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is part of Greater Toronto in the Golden Horseshoe region of Southern Ontario, many Newmarket residents commute to Toronto, located south of the town. In 2013, MoneySense magazine ranked Newmarket 10th out of 200 cities in Canada, in 2017, Amazon Canada ranked Newmarket as number 20 of the top 100 most romantic cities in Canada. Newmarkets geographical coordinates are 44. 05°N,79. 46°W and it has an area of 38.33 km². The town is bounded on the south by Aurora, on the west by King, on the north by East Gwillimbury, the main river in Newmarket is the East Holland River, and all other streams in the town are tributaries thereto. Furthermore, the level in the reach of the East Holland north of Davis Drive is controlled from an unfinished Newmarket Canal lock. The land is characterized mainly by deposits from the last ice age. The town is mainly by sand and gravel, ground by the icesheets that covered the area until about 10,000 years ago. No outcrops are to be anywhere in Newmarket, so deep are the glacial deposits. Newmarket has a continental climate with four distinct seasons featuring cold, somewhat snowy winters and warm. Precipitation is moderate and consistent in all seasons, although summers are a bit wetter than winter due to the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, Newmarkets location on the Holland River long ago made the area a natural route of travel between Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe. A more used route ran down the branch of the Holland River, over the moraine. In 1793, John Graves Simcoe travelled the trail, northward along the route to the west. In June,1800, Timothy Rogers, a Quaker from Vermont, some of the United States Quakers were interested in moving northward, disturbed by the violence they were expected to take part in during the American Revolution. In 1801 Rogers returned along with several Quaker families who had left their homes in Vermont, by the Christmas of 1801, Joseph Hill had constructed a mill on the Holland River, damming it to produce a mill pond that is now known as Fairy Lake. The town of Upper Yonge Street sprouted up around the mill, which explains why its primary downtown area was centred on the Holland River, Hill also built a tannery just to the north of the mill, and the first store and house, as well as additional mills. By 1802, Elisha Beman had begun to establish businesses and buy land in Newmarket, a mill was first and other businesses soon followed. The town continued to grow through the early 19th century, along with the formation of Aurora and Holland Landing, Newmarket played a central role in the Rebellion of 1837
3. Canada – Canada is a country in the northern half of North America. Canadas border with the United States is the worlds longest binational land border, the majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its territory being dominated by forest and tundra. It is highly urbanized with 82 per cent of the 35.15 million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, One third of the population lives in the three largest cities, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Its capital is Ottawa, and other urban areas include Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg. Various aboriginal peoples had inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1,1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick and this began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada. With the Constitution Act 1982, Canada took over authority, removing the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level and it is one of the worlds most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources, Canadas long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. Canada is a country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, Canada is an influential nation in the world, primarily due to its inclusive values, years of prosperity and stability, stable economy, and efficient military. While a variety of theories have been postulated for the origins of Canada. In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona, from the 16th to the early 18th century Canada referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas, until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841. Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the name for the new country at the London Conference. The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act, later that year, the name of national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day
4. Toronto – Toronto is the most populous city in Canada and the provincial capital of Ontario. With a population of 2,731,571, it is the fourth most populous city in North America after Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles. A global city, Toronto is a centre of business, finance, arts, and culture. Aboriginal peoples have inhabited the area now known as Toronto for thousands of years, the city itself is situated on the southern terminus of an ancient Aboriginal trail leading north to Lake Simcoe, used by the Wyandot, Iroquois, and the Mississauga. Permanent European settlement began in the 1790s, after the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase of 1787, the British established the town of York, and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York, York was renamed and incorporated as the city of Toronto in 1834, and became the capital of the province of Ontario during the Canadian Confederation in 1867. The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through amalgamation with surrounding municipalities at various times in its history to its current area of 630.2 km2. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, Toronto is a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canadas major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Toronto is known for its skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, in particular the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere. The name Toronto is likely derived from the Iroquois word tkaronto and this refers to the northern end of what is now Lake Simcoe, where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through this point, in the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon on the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagonon the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the Mississauga had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver Wars, French traders founded Fort Rouillé on the current Exhibition grounds in 1750, but abandoned it in 1759. During the American Revolutionary War, the region saw an influx of British settlers as United Empire Loyalists fled for the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario, the new province of Upper Canada was in the process of creation and needed a capital. Dorchester intended the location to be named Toronto, in 1793, Governor John Graves Simcoe established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands, instead naming it after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Simcoe decided to move the Upper Canada capital from Newark to York, the York garrison was constructed at the entrance of the towns natural harbour, sheltered by a long sandbar peninsula. The towns settlement formed at the end of the harbour behind the peninsula, near the present-day intersection of Parliament Street. In 1813, as part of the War of 1812, the Battle of York ended in the towns capture, the surrender of the town was negotiated by John Strachan. US soldiers destroyed much of the garrison and set fire to the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation, the sacking of York was a primary motivation for the Burning of Washington by British troops later in the war
5. Ontario – Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canadas most populous province by a margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and it is home to the nations capital city, Ottawa, and the nations most populous city, Toronto. There is only about 1 km of land made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border. Ontario is sometimes divided into two regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The great majority of Ontarios population and arable land is located in the south, in contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and is heavily forested. The province is named after Lake Ontario, a thought to be derived from Ontarí, io, a Huron word meaning great lake, or possibly skanadario. Ontario has about 250,000 freshwater lakes, the province consists of three main geographical regions, The thinly populated Canadian Shield in the northwestern and central portions, which comprises over half the land area of Ontario. Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in minerals and in part covered by the Central and Midwestern Canadian Shield forests, studded with lakes, Northern Ontario is subdivided into two sub-regions, Northwestern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the north and northeast, mainly swampy. Southern Ontario which is further sub-divided into four regions, Central Ontario, Eastern Ontario, Golden Horseshoe, the highest point is Ishpatina Ridge at 693 metres above sea level located in Temagami, Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over 500 m are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands, the Carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. A well-known geographic feature is Niagara Falls, part of the Niagara Escarpment, the Saint Lawrence Seaway allows navigation to and from the Atlantic Ocean as far inland as Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario. Northern Ontario occupies roughly 87 percent of the area of the province. Point Pelee is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario that is the southernmost extent of Canadas mainland, Pelee Island and Middle Island in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42°N – slightly farther south than the border of California. The climate of Ontario varies by season and location, the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief. In general, most of Ontarios climate is classified as humid continental, Ontario has three main climatic regions
6. Los Angeles – Los Angeles, officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L. A. is the cultural, financial, and commercial center of Southern California. With a census-estimated 2015 population of 3,971,883, it is the second-most populous city in the United States, Los Angeles is also the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the United States. The citys inhabitants are referred to as Angelenos, historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was founded on September 4,1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence, in 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4,1850, the discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, delivering water from Eastern California, nicknamed the City of Angels, Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, and sprawling metropolis. Los Angeles also has an economy in culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine. A global city, it has been ranked 6th in the Global Cities Index, the city is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields, and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States. The Los Angeles combined statistical area has a gross metropolitan product of $831 billion, making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas. The city has hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984 and is bidding to host the 2024 Summer Olympics and thus become the second city after London to have hosted the Games three times. The Los Angeles area also hosted the 1994 FIFA mens World Cup final match as well as the 1999 FIFA womens World Cup final match, the mens event was watched on television by over 700 million people worldwide. The Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva, a Gabrielino settlement in the area was called iyáangẚ, meaning poison oak place. Gaspar de Portolà and Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí, reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2,1769, in 1771, Franciscan friar Junípero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, the first mission in the area. The Queen of the Angels is an honorific of the Virgin Mary, two-thirds of the settlers were mestizo or mulatto with a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small town for decades, but by 1820. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street. New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, during Mexican rule, Governor Pío Pico made Los Angeles Alta Californias regional capital
7. California – California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western coast of the U. S, California is bordered by the other U. S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. Los Angeles is Californias most populous city, and the second largest after New York City. The Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nations second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, California also has the nations most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. The Central Valley, an agricultural area, dominates the states center. What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its war for independence. The western portion of Alta California then was organized as the State of California, the California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. If it were a country, California would be the 6th largest economy in the world, fifty-eight percent of the states economy is centered on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific and technical business services. Although it accounts for only 1.5 percent of the states economy, the story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandián, written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. The kingdom of Queen Calafia, according to Montalvo, was said to be a land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts. This conventional wisdom that California was an island, with maps drawn to reflect this belief, shortened forms of the states name include CA, Cal. Calif. and US-CA. Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000. The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans, ranging from large, settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior. California groups also were diverse in their organization with bands, tribes, villages. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups, the first European effort to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was a Spanish sailing expedition, led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, in 1542. Some 37 years later English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed a portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila galleons on their trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565
8. Canadian nationality law – Canadian nationality law determines who is eligible to be a citizen of Canada. Canadian nationality is obtained by birth in Canada, or birth abroad when at least one parent is a Canadian citizen or by adoption by at least one Canadian citizen. It can also be granted to a permanent resident who has lived in Canada for a period of time, after Canadian Confederation was achieved in 1867, the new Dominions nationality law initially closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom and all Canadians were classified as British subjects. Section 91 of the British North America Act,1867, passed by the British Parliament in London, however, gave the Parliament of Canada authority over Naturalization, the Immigration Act,1910, for example, created the status of Canadian citizen. The Naturalization Act,1914, increased the period of required to qualify for naturalization in Canada as a British subject from three years to five years. Canadian independence from Britain was obtained incrementally between 1867 and 1982 and this, plus the muddled nature of existing nationality law, prompted the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act,1946, which took effect on 1 January 1947. On that date, Canadian citizenship was conferred on most Canadians previously classified as British subjects, subsequently, on 1 April 1949, Canadian nationality law was extended to Newfoundland, upon the former British colony joining the Canadian confederation as the Province of Newfoundland. Canadian nationality law was revised again on 15 February 1977. From that date, multiple citizenship became legal, however, those who had lost Canadian citizenship before that date did not automatically have it restored until 17 April 2009, when Bill C-37 became law. The 2009 act also limited the issuance of citizenship to children born outside Canada to Canadian ancestors to one generation abroad, under paragraph 3 of the 1977 Citizenship Act, any person who was born in Canada after 14 February 1977 acquires Canadian citizenship at birth. Hence, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada considers all children who were born over Canadian airspace as Canadian citizens. In one 2008 case, a born to a Ugandan mother aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Boston was deemed a Canadian citizen because she was born over Canadian airspace. There are only three exceptions to this rule, which are listed below, in 2012, Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney proposed to modify the jus soli birthright citizenship recognized in Canadian law as a means of discouraging birth tourism. The move had drawn criticism from experts who said that the proposal was based on overhyped popular beliefs, as of 2016, the incumbent Minister John McCallum said during an interview that there is no plan for the change to end birthright citizenship. Under previous legislations, most of people were never considered to be Canadian citizens because they have lost their British subject status before the creation of Canadian citizenship. Persons who had voluntarily renounced British subject status and had their British subject status revoked are ineligible. Under Bill C-37 which went into force on 17 April 2009, prior to Bill C-37 becoming law on 17 April 2009, this only applied to those people born after 15 February 1977. People falling into that category who did not take steps to maintain their citizenship lost their citizenship on that birthday, with Bill C-37 coming into effect on 17 April 2009, there is no longer a requirement or any allowance to apply to maintain citizenship
9. Citizenship of the United States – Citizenship in the United States is a status that entails specific rights, duties and benefits. State citizenship may affect tax decisions and eligibility for some state-provided benefits such as higher education, in Article One of the Constitution, the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization is granted explicitly to Congress. A citizen of another country naturalized as a U. S. citizen may retain their previous citizenship, a U. S. citizen retains U. S. citizenship when becoming the citizen of another country, should that countrys laws allow it. Citizenship can be renounced by American citizens who hold another citizenship via a formal procedure at a U. S. Embassy. United States citizens have the right to reside and work in the United States, certain non-citizens, such as permanent residents, have similar rights, however, non-citizens, unlike citizens, may have the right taken away. For example, they may be deported if convicted of a serious crime, freedom to enter and leave the United States. United States citizens have the right to enter and leave the United States freely, certain non-citizens, such as permanent residents, have similar rights. Unlike permanent residents, U. S. citizens do not have an obligation to maintain residence in the U. S. – they can leave for any length of time, voting for federal office in all fifty states and the District of Columbia is restricted to citizens only. States are not required to extend the franchise to all citizens, for example, several states bar citizen felons from voting, even after they have completed any custodial sentence. The United States Constitution bars states from restricting citizens from voting on grounds of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, failure to pay any tax, or age. Historically, many states and local jurisdictions have allowed non-citizens to vote, however, citizens are not compelled to vote. Freedom to stand for public office, most states have similar requirements, for example California requires that legislators have been citizens for three years, and the Governor have been a citizen for five years, upon taking office. Constitution requires that one be a natural born Citizen and a U. S. resident for fourteen years in order to be President of the United States, the Constitution also stipulates that otherwise eligible citizens must meet certain age requirements for these offices. Jury duty is imposed upon citizens. Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg writes, The professional military has limited the need for citizen soldiers, in the United States today, everyone except those whose income is derived from tax-exempt revenue is required to file a federal income tax return. American citizens are subject to income tax on worldwide income regardless of their country of residence. Consular protection outside the United States, while traveling abroad, if a person is arrested or detained by foreign authorities, the person can request to speak to somebody from the U. S. Embassy or Consulate. Consular officials can provide resources for Americans incarcerated abroad, such as a list of attorneys who speak English
10. Actor – An actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance. Simplistically speaking, the person denominated actor or actress is someone beautiful who plays important characters, the actor performs in the flesh in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής, literally one who answers, the actors interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is playing themselves, as in forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly, to act, is to create. Formerly, in societies, only men could become actors. When used for the stage, women played the roles of prepubescent boys. The etymology is a derivation from actor with ess added. However, when referring to more than one performer, of both sexes, actor is preferred as a term for male performers. Actor is also used before the name of a performer as a gender-specific term. Within the profession, the re-adoption of the term dates to the 1950–1960s. As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper, Im an actor – I can play anything. The U. K. performers union Equity has no policy on the use of actor or actress, an Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the. subject divides the profession. In 2009, the Los Angeles Times stated that Actress remains the term used in major acting awards given to female recipients. However, player remains in use in the theatre, often incorporated into the name of a group or company, such as the American Players. Also, actors in improvisational theatre may be referred to as players, prior to Thespis act, Grecian stories were only expressed in song, dance, and in third person narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called Thespians, the exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama, tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans, as the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire. Records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, from the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder
11. Stand-up comedy – Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD, in stand-up comedy, the feedback of the audience is instant and crucial for the comedians act. Audiences expect a stand-up comic to provide a stream of laughs. Will Ferrell has called stand-up comedy hard, lonely and vicious, a stand-up comedy show may involve only one comedian, or feature a headline or a showcase format. This is followed by one or two middle or featured acts, who perform 15- to 20-minute sets, followed by a headliner who performs for longer, a showcase format may still feature an MC. Bringer shows are another opportunity for amateur performers, the performer must bring a specified number of paying guests in order to get stage time. The guests usually have to pay a charge and there is often a minimum number of drinks that must be ordered. These shows usually have a showcase format and this type of show gives comedians better exposure than open mics because there is usually better audience turnout and industry professionals sometimes go to watch. Different comedy clubs have different requirements for their bringer shows, gotham Comedy Club in New York City, for example, usually has ten-person bringers, while Broadway Comedy Club in New York City usually has six-person bringers. As the name implies, stand-up comedians usually perform their material while standing, stand-up comedy has its origin in classic Parrhesia in 400 BC used for cynics and epicureans in order to tell the reality without censorship. Stand-up comedy in the United Kingdom began in the halls of the 18th and 19th centuries. The heavy censorship regime of the Lord Chamberlains Office required all comedians to submit their acts for censorship, the act would be returned with unacceptable sections underlined in blue pencil. The comedian was then obliged not to deviate from the act in its edited form, the rise of the post-war comedians coincided with the rise of television and radio, and the traditional music hall circuit suffered greatly as a result. By the 1970s, music hall entertainment was virtually dead, alternative circuits had evolved, such as working mens clubs. The alternative comedy scene began to evolve

Book Reviews: Lewin on Modern Wine + Alexander’s Wine for Literature Lovers
October 24, 2017 By Mike Veseth in book reviews, wine	5 Comments
I want to draw your attention to two new wine books. They are as different as different can be, but both are valuable additions to your wine bookshelf.
Indispensable Guide to Modern Wine
The first book is Wine Myths & Reality by Benjamin Lewin MW and I think it is more than just valuable — indispensable would be a better word! Technically this is the second edition of a volume that originally appeared in 2010, but in fact the book is completely rewritten. Lewin says that he thought about re-naming it Modern Wine and I think that alt-title works.
I really admired the first edition of Wine Myths & Reality. When I started teaching a class called The Idea of Wine at the University of Puget Sound I struggled with readings for my students. I wanted something that would go beyond the usual facts and that would allow my students to really engage with what’s dynamic and conttroversial about wine today. Wine Myths & Reality was the perfect choice and it formed the basis of the class along with Tyler Colman’s Wine Politics and my own book, Wine Wars.
The new book (or edition) is even more appealing and compelling. The breadth of topics is amazing — it really is sort of a mini-Master of Wine course in a single volume. Interesting insights seem to jump off each page. Lewin gives us the facts, but they are always in the context of a question he is trying to answer or an argument that he wants to make, so that the book drives forward with great energy.
Attention to detail is obvious throughout the book, but perhaps especially in the illustrations, which include photos, maps, and diagrams that raise the bar for books of this type.
Lewin has organized the book in a very interesting way. He begins, as you might expect, with growing grapes and making wine, but then he pivots to the business side — selling wine and the global markets. His discussion of wine regions is also distinctive — he begins with New World producers before circling back to the Old World, not the other way around as is the usual practice. A final set of chapters examine manipulation in wine in its many forms.
Wine doesn’t make itself, even though we like to think of it that way. Human intervention is always a factor. So what do we want wine to be? And how can we get there? These are the bottom line questions that drive Wine Myths & Reality and make it an indispensable resource for wine enthusiasts everywhere.
Irresistible: Wine is for Booklovers
The second new book is Patrick Alexander’s The Booklovers’ Guide to Wine: A Celebration of the History, Mysteries, and the Literary Pleasures of Drinking Wine. Every glass of wine tells a story and so it is no surprise that people who love books and stories are drawn to wine. Patrick Alexander seems to be the perfect guide for booklovers who want to enjoy wine even more through story-telling.
Alexander is a literary guy (he has also written a book on Proust) who developed the wine appreciation curriculum at the University of Miami and eventually took his signature course to a local bookstore, where it has been a hit (and where Proust book sales coincidentally zoomed). Now his course is available to the rest of us through this book.
Two things set Booklovers’ Guide apart. The first, of course, is the emphasis on story-telling. While the topics and organization are fairly conventional, the choice of stories to illustrate different points plus the wonderful writing really bring familiar topics to life. I have read dozens of wine guides over the years and I can’t think of one that is so much fun. Simply irresistible!
Alexander’s literary references are the second distinctive factor. His abundant quotes from famous authors are clever and really made me think. And the chapter on wine grape varieties — where grapes are compared to famous authors — is both fun and informative.
>>><<<
So here are two valuable books — well written, informative, and utterly engaging. Lewin appeals more to the head (like Bordeaux, they say) and Alexander to the heart (like Burgundy?). Indispensable and irresistible: I like them both and recommend them to you with enthusiasm.

Wine Myths & Reality must be a good read, it is out of stock, sounds interesting. Hopefully it ends up with a Kindle release. Carrying books on flights is not fun. As your book is available for Kindle, I will give it a read! Cheers Oz

Global Rosé Market Q&A
March 12, 2019 By Mike Veseth in The Next Big Thing, wine, wine markets	3 Comments
Interest in Rosé wine is on the rise. The most recent Nielsen numbers (as reported in Wine Business Monthly) show that sales of Rosé wine in the U.S. market is growing by more than 40% per year — the fastest growth rate of any category.
Producers want to better understand the Rosé phenomenon, which explains why both the Unified Wine & Grape Symposium and the Washington Winegrowers convention featured specialized Rosé seminars this year.
This column aims to add to the discussion by bringing together what Sue and I have learned at the Unified and during recent visits to France, Spain, and Italy, some insights from Elizabeth Gabay‘s recent book, Rosé: understanding the pink revolution, and a 2015 report on the global Rosé market produced by the OIV and the Provence Wine Council (CIVP). Here is a pdf of the OIV/CIVP report.
Who Makes the Most Rosé Wine?
Rosé is made pretty much wherever wine is made and sometimes accounts for a remarkable share of a region’s production (think about how important Mateus and Lancer’s Rosé were for Portugal during their peak years).
France is the largest producer by far today followed by Spain, the United States, and Italy. Production has increased dramatically in Australia, Chile, and South Africa, according to the OIV/CIVP report.
Who Buys It?
Let me answer this question three ways using three different figures from the OIV/CIVP report. The data are from 2014, so current data will differ, but the patterns are still relevant.
Rosé wine sales are significant just about everywhere wine is consumed, but France is the market leader. Rosé accounted for 30% of all wine sold in France in 2014 according to the study, consistent with other reports that Rosé outsells white wine in French supermarkets, which feature large sections devoted solely to the pink stuff.
Although France is the largest Rosé producer in the world, it actually imports Rosé from Spain, which is the largest Rosé exporter. I think there is a pattern of inexpensive Spanish imports, which fill supermarket shelves with box wine, although that is only part of the story.
Is Rosé a wine for women? I have heard this said many times and never really believed it. The OIV/CIVP study casts doubt on this stereotype. Although women drink significantly more Rosé than men in some markets such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, there doesn’t seem to be a strong gender bias in other markets. especially in France but also in the U.S., Russia, and Canada. Men drink more Rosé than women in Brazil, according to the study.
Finally, consider the distribution of sales by age group. Winemakers today are very interested in breaking into the millennial market. So it is significant that the OIV/CIVP study finds a strong youth bias in Rosé consumption. Young people in every country surveyed here have a higher Rosé consumption than older people. France is noteworthy because all age groups consume Rosé in substantial quantities, even if the younger ones drink a bit more.
Bottom line: the market for Rosé seems to be both broad and deep. No wonder everyone is so interested.
How Much Does Color Matter? Is Rosé Just a Summer Wine?
Wait — that’s two questions. I wrote about color in an earlier column, so I will make that answer short. The conventional wisdom is that pale Rosé sells better than darker Rosé wines. But the fact is that Rosé from around the world comes in many different hues (as Sue’s photo above from a tasting in the Loire Valley shows).
I agree with Elizabeth Gabay that the color issue is exaggerated, but I don’t expect to convince anyone. If someone makes a darker Rosé and it doesn’t sell, I am sure that the color (not other factors) will be blamed. They used to say that nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment and no one’s going to get a pink slip for making too pale a Rosé wine.
The summer wine question is quite interesting and can be answered in two ways. Yes, Rosé is a summer wine in the sense that there is a strong seasonal component in sales. Consumers drink more Rosé in warmer months. But Rosé is not just a summer wine as sales are now significant throughout the year.
Is There Easy Money in Rosé?
The answer to this question is related to the seasonality question above. It is easy to imagine that Rosé is a Chateau Cash Flow kind of wine. You pick the grapes, make the wine, ship the wine, cash the check — all in just a few months. The money pours in on a timeline only a little longer than Beaujolais Nouveau, which is the ultimate cash flow wine.
But there’s a hitch in the easy money Rosé game — you have to sell out to make it work. The residual seasonality of Rosé sales means that moving your product in February is more difficult than in July or August. And although I have had some Rosé that has benefited from a few years of bottle age, the conventional wisdom is that last year’s Rosé is over the hill — Rosé passé!
The consumer preference for fresher Rosé (which is also true for some other wines, such as Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc) creates a problem for producers. If you don’t sell out, then last year’s slow-selling wine is likely to clog up the supply chain, discouraging orders for this year’s wine. Reliable supply is important to developing customer loyalty, so you want to have enough, but excess supply is hard to get rid of. Rosé producers must navigate complicated currents!
That’s all there is space for this week. Please leave comments with more Rosé questions and answers.

Great post with lots of food for thought. At least here in Spain where a bottle of rosé will be significantly cheaper than the same winery and vintage of red (and I’m talking about as much as half the price), I wonder if this isn’t one of the main reasons that it’s more popular with the younger crowds?

Good point! Price is always an issue.

Mike, I missed the earlier column on color, but I see plenty of terrific rosés that are quite pale. More important in terms of quality is whether the rosé is made simply by adding red wine to white, or by the saignée process, or (best by far) produced from vines specifically planted, trained, pruned and harvested for rosé.

Champs-Élysées
The Avenue des Champs-Élysées (French pronunciation: [av(ə).ny de ʃɑ̃z‿e.li.ze]) is a boulevard in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, 1.9 kilometres (1.2 mi) long and 70 metres (230 ft) wide, which runs between the Place de la Concorde and the Place Charles de Gaulle, where the Arc de Triomphe is located. It is known for its theatres, cafés and luxury shops, and for the military parade that takes place each year on the avenue on 14 July to celebrate Bastille Day. The name is French for the Elysian Fields, the paradise for dead heroes in Greek mythology. The French proudly nickname this world-famous avenue "la plus belle avenue du monde" ("the world's most beautiful avenue").
Description
The avenue runs for 1.91 km (1.18 mi) through the 8th arrondissement in northwestern Paris, from the Place de la Concorde in the east, with the Obelisk of Luxor, to the Place Charles de Gaulle (formerly the Place de l'Étoile) in the west, location of the Arc de Triomphe. The Champs-Élysées forms part of the Axe historique.

Wind turbine
A wind turbine is a device that converts kinetic energy from the wind into electrical power. The term appears to have migrated from parallel hydroelectric technology (rotary propeller). The technical description for this type of machine is an aerofoil-powered generator.
The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of vertical and horizontal axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power for boats or caravans or to power traffic warning signs. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, are becoming an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used by many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
History
Windmills were used in Persia (present-day Iran) about 500-900 A.D. The windwheel of Hero of Alexandria marks one of the first known instances of wind powering a machine in history. However, the first known practical windmills were built in Sistan, an Eastern province of Iran, from the 7th century. These "Panemone" were vertical axle windmills, which had long vertical drive shafts with rectangular blades. Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water, and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries.

Preparing for the storm: Do a life insurance check-up
Understanding Insurance
January 28, 2016
Having a life insurance policy is a bit like storing up food in case of a natural disaster. When the storm hits, having that extra supply could be a lifesaver… but what happens if years go by before you use it? If you haven’t been checking it regularly, the food will be spoiled.
Even if you already have a life insurance policy, you probably haven’t given it a second thought since you bought it.
In a way, that’s the point. Insurance is meant to deliver peace of mind so you don’t have to worry about the future. However, the policy won’t do you much good if it doesn’t meet your current needs.
What’s changed in your life?
A lot can change during the course of a year, and any major life event could be a good reason to start or change a life insurance policy.¹
You had a birthday
You changed jobs
You bought or sold a house
You got married or divorced
You had a death in the family
You had a baby or grandchild
You had an accident or illness
You retired
You may find that you need to adjust your level of coverage, change beneficiaries, or get a completely new policy.
Everything you need for the life of your retirement
Annuities
Life Insurance
Long Term Care
Medicare Supplement
Why is it important?
The main thing you have to remember about life insurance is that it’s not about you; it’s about your loved ones.
You want to protect them from the burden of financial expenses and leave behind good memories. At a minimum, your family shouldn’t have to worry about paying off expenses from funeral services or hospital bills.
Before life’s big disaster hits, make sure that you’re prepared. At Bankers Life, we’re here to help ensure that your financial future is secure. Explore our coverage options to learn more about what we can do for you.
When you know your life insurance policy is up to date, it will be easier to brave the coming storm.

Robert De Niro Slams Donald Trump Over Birther Views
Published April 25, 2011
Robert De Niro joins the ever-expanding lists of celebrities who have taken issue with Donald Trump’s questioning of President Obama’s citizenship.
Trump has made headlines in recent weeks over publicly aligning himself with the “birther” point of view that President Obama is hiding his birth certificate for fear of being exposed as not being born in the U.S.
During a public interview with NBC News' Brian Williams on Saturday night at the Tribeca Film Festival, De Niro took aim at Trump’s stance. The actor said, "I won't mention names, but certain people in the news the last couple weeks, just, what are they doing? It's crazy. They're making statements about people that they don't even back up. Go get the facts before you start saying things about people."
When Williams asked if he was referring to a man who has a show "on my network on Sunday night," De Niro confirmed he was referring to Trump. De Niro continued hammering Trump on his birther beliefs, saying, “Don't go out there and say things unless you can back them up. How dare you? That's awful to do."
In response, Trump said, "I like his acting, but in terms of when I watch him doing interviews and various things, we're not dealing with Albert Einstein."

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2 Premiere Date Set
Posted by Dan Wickline July 15, 2014 Comment
The season finale of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D left a lot more questions than answers. We still don’t know who or what the blue alien was. What Agent Phil Coulson will now do as the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and what their new direction will be. Also, what exactly was Coulson writing on the wall. And what’s up with Patton Oswalt.
If you want to rewatch the first season, you’ll get the chance as the series comes to Blu-ray and DVD on September 9th, the same day as Marvel’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
And now we know that the second season kicks off on ABC on Tuesday, September 23 at 9 p.m. ET/PT, the network announced today.
About Dan Wickline
Has quietly been working at Bleeding Cool for over three years. He has written comics for Image, Top Cow, Shadowline, Avatar, IDW, Dynamite, Moonstone, Humanoids and Zenescope. He is the author of the Lucius Fogg series of novels and a published photographer.

Donald Trump’s economic team may tweak trade figures to make deficits look bigger, helping his push for tariffs. Though politicians have always cherry-picked numbers, fiddling with actual statistics threatens confidence. It also raises expectations Trump will struggle to meet.

Context News
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering changing the way it calculates trade deficits to make the trade gap look bigger, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 19 citing people involved in the discussions.
The WSJ said the government was considering excluding from U.S. exports any goods first imported into the country, and then transferred to a third country like Canada or Mexico unchanged.
Those goods, known as re-exports, are currently counted in both import and export numbers. Excluding them from exports figures would increase the reported U.S. trade deficit.
Last year, the United States re-exported goods worth $224 billion, according to Census Bureau data. Excluding those goods would widen the U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world to $960 billion, from $735 billion.
Administration officials told the WSJ that the idea was part of an early discussion and that they were examining various options.
The Trump administration has used economic growth forecasts in its budget planning that are much more optimistic than those made by independent agencies and private forecasters, the WSJ reported on Feb. 17.

These days, a lot of people are striving to become financially independent; something that is often achieved by growing your money in business.
If you’re still unsure of what business to open or where to invest your money, then you might consider doing so in a farm. One option is FarmOn where you can invest in as little as Php1,500; return on investment (ROI) if usually somewhere from 10 to 20% after at least 4 months, depending on the crop or livestock you were able to get during the registration period.

But if you have a higher capital to invest, you can also try DV Boer where ROIs are guaranteed at a specific rate for a fixed time frame.
What is DV Boer?
With its main farm set in Balibago in Lian, Batangas, DV Boer began its operations in October 2014. The farm, set on 11 hectares of land, is a breeding haven for goats imported from Australia.
The successful business venture led to several sub-farms across the Philippines.

What makes DV Boer different from other farms is that it is open to ‘crowdfunding’, similar to FarmOn.
Investors at DV Boer pick a farm to invest in and the package they want to avail of, subject to availability. Despite the high capital requirement required, wait lists at DV Boer and its subfarms are often long. Investors often have to wait a number of months to get a slot.
How to Invest in DV Boer?
Step 1. Because the farms are not always open for investment, it is best that you register at Pa-Iwi Online to receive email updates.
Step 2. You can invest at the main farm or sub-farms, with these Pa-Iwi Packages.

Step 3. On Pa-iwi Online, click on ‘Request Pa-iwi’ from the menu on the left. You will be redirected to a page where you can choose the package you want to avail as well as the quantity you wish to avail.

Step 4. Wait for email update from the admin for the availability of farms to cater to your request.
Step 5. You will receive instructions as to how you can pay for the investment as well as how you can receive the notarized contract.
Step 6. Sit back and relax. You don’t have to do anything but wait until the scheduled payout, depending on the package you availed. DV Boer sends profits to investors every year.

How To Watch The Donald Trump Porn Appearance That Has Got To Be The First For A Presidential Candidate, Seriously
How To Watch The Donald Trump Porn Appearance That Has Got To Be The First For A Presidential Candidate, Seriously
By Jenny Hollander
Sept 30 2016
Spencer Platt/Getty Images News/Getty Images
Oh, dear God. On Friday afternoon, BuzzFeed broke the news that Donald Trump was featured in a softcore pornography video. I quote, "BuzzFeed News obtained the footage from the online-only Buffalo, New York–based adult video store Cinema Cornucopia." According to BuzzFeed, the cover of the Playboy VHS reads: "From luxuriating in a warm, soapy tub, to reveling at an exclusive night club, Carol and Darlene bare their sex appeal and lead you on a sensual journey of discovery."
To be clear, Trump has not starred in porn. As in, Trump is not nude. (I know; you can exhale now.) Trump merely appears in the 2000 Playboy video breaking open a bottle of champagne alongside some Playmates, and the video, at its most explicit, is softcore porn. I mean, in all senses, this is all fine and great and typical of a celebrity. It's probably the most ordinary and non-offensive thing he's done to date. And there's nothing wrong with pornography — watching it, starring in it, appreciating it, you name it.
But. But. On Friday morning — at 3 a.m., to be precise — Trump had ordered his followers to look up the alleged sex tape of former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado, whom he branded "disgusting." "Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?" he wrote. On Friday evening, in a perfectly-timed moment of serendipity, BuzzFeed published the video.
Let's reiterate: On Friday morning, in the middle of the night, Trump describes Alicia as "disgusting," using her alleged "sex tape" as proof. On Friday evening, it emerges that Trump himself appeared in a pornographic video. You really cannot make this up.
You can watch the video on BuzzFeed here. At your own risk, mind you.
Side note: You're probably seeing this Tweet in a whole different light now.
Shudder.
"Beauty is beauty," says Trump in the video, because of course he does.
Meanwhile, the campaign unveiled a new ad starring Ivanka Trump on Friday.
Team Trump on YouTube
In the video, Ivanka says, "My father will change outdated labor laws so that they support women and American families. He will provide tax credits for child care, paid maternity leave and dependent-care savings accounts," according to the Washington Post.

Ben Carson Is Losing His Mind Over Having To Defend Donald Trump Every Freaking Day
Ben Carson Is Losing His Mind Over Having To Defend Donald Trump Every Freaking Day
By Chris Tognotti
Oct 14 2016
JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images
Well, this is rough. Over the past few days, the Donald Trump presidential campaign has become embroiled in what will likely be, when it's all said and done, the defining scandal of the entire 2016 election. Namely, the campaign is contending with multiple accusations of sexual assault against Trump, allegations that track tightly with the candidate's own boasts of non-consensual kissing and groping heard in the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape. And it's becoming increasingly clear his surrogates don't know what to do ― for instance, Ben Carson asked to cut Katty Kay's mic during his defense of the Republican nominee on MSNBC's Morning Joes, because he couldn't handle being asked a simple and direct question.
Namely: Are you saying these women are all liars? That's the official line from the man at the top, to be clear ― simmering with ill-concealed rage and conspiracy theory during a campaign event, Trump himself called his accusers liars, just one day before Carson's case study in disastrous surrogacy.
Carson was appearing on MSNBC and received a question from BBC reporter Katty Kay, who pointedly asked whether he believed that the women coming forward against Trump are lying. And ― perhaps beleaguered by months of strenuously defending the indefensible ― Carson snapped.
Washington Free Beacon on YouTube
That's your characterization, because you need to characterize it that way to try to make me the bad guy.
This prompted Kay to interrupt, reasserting her plain, straightforward question, at which point Carson lost it, entreating the show's titular host Joe Scarborough to cut Kay's microphone. Because a conversation about sexual assault is the perfect time to try to silence women.
No no no no, stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop. Hey, can you turn her microphone off please? Turn the microphone off so I can talk?
To his credit, Scarborough had none of it. "No. It's a simple question, yes or no," Scarborough said, "do you think believe these women are lying or not?" Carson's answer? "It doesn't matter." Ergo, in his world, it doesn't matter whether or not a Trump is a repeated sexual predator or not.
It doesn't matter whether they're lying or not, what matters is that the train is going off the cliff. We're taking our eye off of that, and we're getting involved in other issues that can be taken care of later.
Needless to say, Carson's assertion that this can be "taken care of later" is absurd in the context of a general election campaign with slightly less than a month to go ― unless he means that we can all tsk-tsk Trump after he's inaugurated, which sends a truly great message to the women of America about just how seriously their physical and sexual autonomy should be taken.
Ty Wright/Getty Images News/Getty Images
But really, the reason so many Trump surrogates are flailing and twisting in the wind on this topic is plainly obvious: There are no good answers. Either all of Trump's accusers (who now number in the double-digits) are lying about him, or he's a serial sexual abuser unfit to lead the United States, much less to be alone around women in any social or professional context.
Obviously, Trump has strenuously denied all of the allegations, and he hasn't shied away from saying what Carson clearly didn't want to ― he lambasted his accusers as "horrible liars" at a rally speech in West Palm Beach, Florida just one day after the allegations dropped.

"How's your daughter?"
Miguel Solis, the Dallas ISD trustee, stopped by and strolled through the office Wednesday. And with every few steps, a staffer, most strangers with whom he'd never interacted, would stop him to ask how his 7-month-old girl was doing after her well-chronicled open-heart surgeries, transplant and protracted stay in the neonatal intensive care unit at Children's Medical Center Dallas.
Just great, he would say, again and again, grinning broadly. He is happy to deliver good news. Not so long ago, he and his wife, pediatrician Jacqueline Nortman, had started planning for Olivia Renee Faith Solis' funeral.
There was a time earlier this year, from spring into mid-summer, when Olivia's story was seemingly inescapable, covered in every Dallas media outlet — often, as in the case of this newspaper, several times over. It was deeply distressing, the tale of the baby born with the broken heart. Riveting, too, as doctors at Children's endeavored to keep Olivia alive as they scrambled to find for her a tiny replacement. And terrifying, as we watched in real time while Solis documented via Twitter the risks taken to keep their daughter alive.
Living by Faith: Dallas ISD trustee's young family draws strength from their newborn’s fight
"The goal was to give Olivia every opportunity to fight, because she was proving she could," Solis said this week. "There was never a point where we were going to rob her of an opportunity to keep fighting."
She got that new heart in May — from whom, Mom and Dad do not know. A month later, on June 19, Olivia went home, after which those stories stopped appearing; after all, we had our happy ending. It's right there in a newly available 16-page children's book titled Olivia's New Heart, written by Solis and Nortman and illustrated by Dallas artist Skyler Thiot, proceeds from which will go to the Heart Center at Children's Health.
On the final page, a mother and father hold hands with a little girl, now a few years old. The girl, Olivia, stands and smiles wide. So, too, does her heart. Above them it reads:
"The brave new heart fit Olivia just right and they enjoyed a future filled with fun!"

In truth, this story has no neat-and-tidy resolution. The hospital visits are never-ending — now and for the foreseeable future. Doctors say there is every reason to believe Olivia could live as long as 30 years with her new heart, a decade longer than once thought. But hers remains a fragile existence.
Olivia, who still has a nasogastric tube providing her with food and medication, must be taken to the hospital or the outpatient center at least once a week. For blood draws. For physical and occupational and speech therapy — the latter, Solis said, "because of the NG tube, in since the fifth day of her life."
There are appointments with neurologists, because of strokes Olivia endured early on. She takes 15 doses of medication a day — among them immunosuppressants that keep her body from rejecting her heart, meds needed to bolster her immune system and other elixirs to stave off seizures and calm her roiling insides. Olivia vomits three times a day, Solis said, for reasons doctors cannot yet pinpoint.
Dallas ISD trustee's baby girl undergoes successful heart transplant surgery
Her care remains around-the-clock. Before Olivia was born, Solis' mother, Sherrlyn, had planned to retire and travel the world, stopping in Dallas on occasion to visit and play with her granddaughter. But now, Solis said, she has "become a third parent," having moved in with the couple.
"And then we've had to figure out ways to piece together the funds necessary to have a home-health nurse who stays with the baby and my mom throughout the day," he said. There is, in fact, a still-active GoFundMe page, where donations, I cannot help but notice, slowed to a trickle once it was announced Olivia had gone home.
"The thing that got us through this from the beginning," he said, "has been faith and love and just this fortitude and determination that was birthed through Olivia fighting. There were many conversations I remember throughout the stay in ICU related to life and death, discussions about how this surgery could kill her and do you want to do it and will you sign her life away and all the effects that will make hers a difficult life."

There is still the risk that Olivia's new heart could fail. Or the immunosuppressive meds could result in lymphatic cancer. Or her coronary arteries could narrow and result in a heart attack. The list of awful could-bes is endless. But anything is better than that night almost eight months ago, when mother and father were told their child would not survive beyond her fifth night.
Solis said they created and self-published this book as a thank-you, a fundraiser, a balm. They wrote it for the families who were in the ICU when Olivia was born Feb. 22 and who remain there, awaiting their second chances. And they wrote it for the friends they made there who left the hospital without their children.
Olivia's New Heart looks like a kids' book — bright, shiny, something that could survive a spill from a juice box. And it has a happy ending, yes. But as Solis puts it, speaking for Olivia but really everyone who might need such a reminder, "No day is promised, no day is guaranteed."

Mad Maxine Waters to Congressman: “I Resent The Remark About ‘Making America Great Again’

Well, Mad Maxine Waters just can’t keep her foot out of her mouth, and this week was no exception as the California representative tore into a fellow representative saying that she resented his comments about making America great again.
Waters, who has been an unhinged critic of President Donald Trump to the point of being a basket case, responded to comments from Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA).
Conservative Review reports:

Members of Congress were debating a repeal of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection’s 2013 auto lending guidance, which applied anti-discrimination legislation to “indirect” auto lending (loans put together by a car dealer through a third-party lender). Republicans say this regulation “essentially outlawed the practice of auto dealers in America being able to take wholesale financing from third parties and charge retail rates.” Democrats claim the repeal of this rule would encourage discrimination against minorities.
At one point, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., responded to this criticism, pointing his finger at Waters and saying, “We are trying to make sure that we’re making America great every day in every way and the best way to do that is to stop stalking about discrimination and start talking about the nation. We’re coming together as a people, in spite of what you say.”
At the end of Kelly’s remarks, House Financial Services Committee chairman Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., reminded members to address the chair when they speak, not to address each other, in accordance with House rules.

When Kelly finished and yielded his time, the ever indignant Waters tore into him.
“Mr. Kelly, please do not leave,” she said. “Because I want you to know that I am more offended as an African-American woman than you will ever be. And this business about ‘making America great again,’ it is your president that’s dividing this country.”
Right there is part of her problem. She doesn’t identify as an American, but a divided American. She isn’t even from Africa! I have white friends who are actually African (South African) and they are offended at such statements.
Waters doesn’t care about bringing people together. she defended one of the most divisive men who occupied the Oval Office in our history and those aren’t just my thoughts, but the very comments of a black sheriff named David Clark.
“And don’t talk to me about the fact that we don’t understand,” she continued. “That’s the attitude that’s been given toward women time and time again.”
Chairman McClintock was ignored by Waters after he reminded her to address the chair, and then she denied Kelly an opportunity to respond to her comments.
“I respect the chair, but don’t stop me in the middle when you didn’t stop him in the middle, and so I shall continue,” she said, turning to Kelly again. “Don’t you dare talk to me like that and think that somehow women don’t understand what goes on on the floor of automobile dealers.”
Good grief, this woman sounds like a little baby who needs her diaper changed for goodness sakes.
McClintock attempted to enforce the House rules again, but was ignored once more.
“I don’t appreciate that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more about discrimination than I know about discrimination,” she said. “I resent that and I resent the remark about ‘making America great again.’ He’s down here making a speech for this dishonorable president of the United States of America.”
“Having said that, I reserve the balance of my time. And no, I do not yield, not one second to you,” she told Kelly when he asked if she would yield. “Not one second. Not one second to you.”
This is one of many Democrats who talk about “biapartisanship.” It’s absolute non-sense and they know it, but you see how people like Maxine Waters get their panties in a bunch and then attack, turn around and will play the victim.

As for Kelly, I think his comments were spot on. For Waters, I can only say it just gives more weight to the fact that she is a person that has completely come unglued, demonstrating that liberalism is, in fact, a mental disorder.

Transcript
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: That day, September 3rd, we also sat down with Standing Rock Sioux tribal historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard to speak about another attack against her tribe, this one on the same day 153 years before. It was on September 3rd, 1863, that the U.S. Army massacred more than 300 members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in what’s become known as the Whitestone massacre. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard is not only the tribal historian, but also one of the founders of the Sacred Stone Camp, the first resistance camp launched on her land April 1st, 2016, to resist the Dakota Access pipeline.
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: A hundred and fifty-three years ago—fifty-two years ago, the Whitestone massacre happened, which the people in this community, the Cannon Ball community, are from, descendants of that massacre. We are the survivors of that massacre. One of the things that, you know, I always say is, this massacre happened, America forgot they killed us. And we have just—spending this time trying to figure out how to survive. So, we were the wrong Indians that they killed at that time. The Dakota Wars were happening in 1863. And so the government put up these armed forces to go after the Isanti, the Santee, and so they put this military action together.
On the morning of September 3rd, our people were gathered, as we do every year at this time. We gather because it’s harvest time. The fruit and vegetables are ready. It is a time when we are doing the buffalo call, and we have ceremonies to call the buffaloes for the people to come to hunt, so that we can prepare the meat for winter. So this is what was happening at Whitestone at that time. And so, we have a large gathering of 4,000 people. And I think that’s kind of unique. There’s almost 4,000 people here. And so, we had all of these communities coming in together to go into this trade. And as people are preparing buffalo hides and getting dry meat ready, they are also visiting, making relatives, having marriages. All of these things are happening in this camp. And so, they say the soldiers are coming. And our leaders said, “We have never had an argument with the white people. We have only been at peace. We do not have a treaty with them.” And so, our people got together and said, “We heard that if you take a white flag, they will honor that to talk with us.” So they took a white flour sack, and they put it on a stick, and our leaders all went out into the soldiers to say they wanted to talk.
AMY GOODMAN: Your grandfather was one of them?
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: Yes. So my grandfather was a medicine man. His name was Tatanka Ohikita, Brave Buffalo. So, Brave Buffalo was among them, with the chiefs. They went out to talk to the soldiers. The soldiers surrounded them and took them as a prisoners of war and cordoned them off from their people. And so, the people were watching. And just like we are taught, automatically, if there is an enemy coming in, we gather all the children in the center, all the women. People were starting to tear down their lodges. People were trying to move in the chaos. So the first things the women did is they tied the babies to the dogs, they tied the children to the horses, and they shooed the dogs and the horses out of the camp. And then they gathered what they could, and they started running.
Well, at the camp, at Whitestone, they came down, and there’s this ravine. And so the people started making their way down to the ravine. And it’s kind of bizarre to us that these soldiers came in just as the sun was going down. And so, they were going to the ravine. And the soldiers came on this top of the ravine and this top of the ravine, and started shooting the women and children in the ravine. And one of the—one of our soldiers went out in front and broke the open, so that people can continue running. So, as night is falling, my grandma, Nape Hota Win, Grey Hand, she was running, and, she said, all of a sudden she had a sharp pain in her hip, and she fell down.
AMY GOODMAN: She was a child.
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: Yeah, she was nine years old. And she laid on that ground, and she spent the night calling, “Ina! Ina!” or “Mom! Mom!” with no answer. Everywhere, she could hear the crying and screams, the songs of people dying. And as the sun came over and she could see everything that was happening, two of the soldiers came and grabbed her and threw her in the back of a buckboard. I am unsure of why that happened, because they went around, and they killed the other wounded. Why they did not kill my grandmother, I do not know.
So she laid in the buckboard as she watched the soldiers come and start killing the dogs and the babies, killing the horses, killing the wounded. They gathered up all of our property—the tents, the meat, the hides, everything we own. And we had one section of soldiers sitting down there poking holes in the bottom of our pots. And they gathered all that, and they started this great big fire, burning all our food, our homes, everything. They said that there was so much buffalo meat that they burned, that tallow ran down like rivers out into the creeks. And the people ran. For three to four days they ran, as the soldiers continued to chase and kill them. Part of our people came across here. This used to be a narrow crossing, where they crossed. And they crossed over on this side of the river to get from the soldiers.
And one of the things that we always say at this massacre is they forgot they killed us, and we weren’t even the right Indians.
AMY GOODMAN: That river crossing that you’ve described, the people fleeing from the soldiers, that’s where the Dakota Access pipeline will be built?
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: Yes. Right where the Dakota Access pipeline is the area where our people made it across the river. It is our major river crossing there. And I will say that where this pipeline is going underneath the Missouri River is also a burial site, and so they’ll be going underneath this burial site. We are very concerned because any type of motion can bring up our remains.
AMY GOODMAN: Standing Rock Sioux tribal historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard. We’ll be back in a minute.

Treatment, Prognosis, Recovery Period of Coma or Comatose
Reviewed By: Pramod Kerkar, MD, FFARCSI
How is Coma or Comatose Treated?
The emergency care persons will carry and provide the basic essentials like glucose or antibiotics by injections even if the blood test is in progress and not yet returned. This is done to eliminate the situations of diabetic shock or brain infections.
Coma or comatose which is classified as a medical emergency needs the check-up from the doctor where he will check the blood circulation in the affected person, his/ her airway passage and helps in respiration. Doctors may give, blood transfusions and breathing assistance and some other supportive care if these two primary requirements are not met.
Depending on the reasons treatment varies for coma or comatose. A medical procedure to decrease the pressure on the brain due to brain swelling, might be necessary. Doctors will provide medications as a treatment to the condition if coma or comatose occurs due to the over dosage of drug. Doctors will recommend and follow the medications to control seizures if the coma or comatose occurs due to seizures.
Other treatments may include focus on therapies or medications for addressing a disease that is underlying, such as liver disease or diabetes.
The reason of the coma or comatose may be completely reversed sometimes and person affected will regain to the normal function. But in the case if the affected person suffers due to severe brain damage, then there is a possibility of permanent disabilities or the patients may never regain to original condition which means consciousness. The person is said to be brain dead or may enter a persistent vegetative state.
The "Coma Cocktail" Treatment for Coma or Comatose
Even though the treatment options depend on the underlying reasons of coma or comatose, some rules for general treatment can also be made use of. When a reason of the coma is unknown, then "coma cocktail" should be provided to the person. Coma cocktail is a combined mixture of glucose (glucose can help diabetic patients with low blood sugar), naloxone (Naloxone is a chemical which is used in treating the patients who are overdosed) and thiamin (thiamin is a vitamin combination which helps who are deprived of nutrition, e.g. alcoholics).
Correction of Electrolyte Imbalance or Toxic Substances in Coma or Comatose
Correction of electrolyte imbalance or toxic substances can help the patient come out of coma or comatose sometimes. Electrolytes are chemicals commonly like salts, such as chlorine and sodium salts, which can be found in the tissues and blood throughout the body and play a major role in most of the physiological mechanism. Depending on the reason of the coma or comatose, there may be necessity to correct any electrolyte abnormalities. For example a kidney dialysis which is a process that maintains normal electrolyte balance in the kidneys and removes toxins.
Decreasing Intracranial Pressure for Coma or Comatose
Decreasing intracranial pressure in the brain can help the patients of coma or comatose. Various things such as diuretics, hyperventilation and surgery can be done to reduce pressure in the brain if high pressure it is a reason of coma or comatose in a person. Hyperventilation is the process of increasing the depth and rate of breathing by which the blow flow slows down and blood vessels in the brain constrict, which may decrease the pressure in the brain. Diuretics, reduces the pressure in the brain by removing fluid that are excess in the brain. Intracranial pressure can be decreased by a surgery which is mainly done to remove the excess fluid known as hydrocephalus if there is any accumulation of fluid in ventricles.
Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS Scale for Coma or Comatose
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used before the decision making stage whether to use CT scan for coma or comatose. Severity of brain damage can be analyzed by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) which helps doctors in case of a head injury. It scores patients according to, motor responses, how easily they open their eyes and verbal responses.
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of Eyes
Grade of 1 - Eyes should not be open.
Grade of 2 - Response to painful stimuli in the form of opens eyes (when pain is sensed).
Grade of 3 - Response to voice by opening eyes.
Grade of 4 - Spontaneous reply in the form of opening eyes.
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on Verbal Grades
Grade of 1 - Patient cannot make any kind of noise.
Grade of 2 - Sounds that are incomprehensible (mumbles).
Grade of 3 - Use of inappropriate words.
Grade of 4 - Disorientated and confused use of words.
Grade of 5 - chats normally, topic oriented words.
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) for Motor (Physical Reflexes) Grades
Grade of 1 - No movements are made by the patient.
Grade of 2 - Extension is made by the patient with movement in the limbs to painful stimuli.
Grade of 3 - Abnormal flexion with moves in a strange way to painful stimuli.
Grade of 4 - Withdrawal/ flexion with moves to painful stimuli.
Grade of 5 - Localizes the painful stimuli. The patient can know where the pain is originating from.
Grade of 6 - understands and obeys requests.
Brain Injury will be Classified in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) As:
Coma is the output when the score is 8 or less.
Moderate is the condition when the score is ranging between 9 and 12.
Minor when the score is 13 or higher.
Even a person who is awaken is said to be in coma (lighter coma) when the score is high as specified above as there is no response to the surrounding situations.
Initial evaluation process has the scale as part, but does not helps in diagnosing the reason of coma. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) can be used as a standard method since scores are used as a level of coma to assess change in patient status for any health-caregiver.
What is the Prognosis/ Outlook for Coma or Comatose?
The prognosis or the outlook for a coma or comatose varies from situation to situation. Chances of recovery of a person depend on the duration of the coma comatose, the cause of slipping into coma and whether the problem can be corrected. The person can return to his or her original condition when the problem is resolved. A person may be permanently disabled or never regain consciousness sometimes, if the brain damage is severe.
If the medical treatment is provided correctly and on time, coma or comatose that result from drug poisonings, can be recovered easily. Higher rate of recovery can be seen in head injury compared to the coma that occurs due to lack of oxygen supply to the brain.
Coma cannot be easily predicted when a person is in coma since everyone is different. The best option is to consult a doctor. The prognosis will get worse when the person remains in coma. After so many weeks in coma condition a person may recover but may have or suffer due to significant disabilities.
What is the Recovery Period for Coma or Comatose?
A coma or comatose usually can last for few weeks, during which time the patient may recover slowly by gaining consciousness, gradual wakeup or the patient can progress into a different state of unconsciousness which is known as vegetative state or minimally conscious state.
A vegetative state: The person will be awake without any knowledge about themselves or environment around him/ her.
A minimally conscious state: Limited awareness consciousness arrives and goes randomly.
The recovery depends where some may recover gradually where others cannot, even after long years.
Gradual recovery will be there for people who do wake up from a coma or comatose. The patients may be very confused and agitated to start with.
Some may gain complete recovery and will be unaffected by the cause of coma or comatose. Others may get affected due to the disabilities reasoned by the damage to the brain. Occupational therapy, support physical therapy (PT), and psychological assessment are required during a period of rehabilitation, and also require good care for the rest of their own life.
The severity and the reason for the injury in brain decides the chances of recovery from coma or comatose. Apart from this the coma duration, the patient's age is also important for recovery. Accurate prediction is impossible about the recovery and the time coma or comatose may last and about the side-effects that may have long term problems.

What Causes Your Heart to Pound?
Heart pounding or heart palpitations are very troublesome and are a cause of concern for your overall good health and wellbeing. Palpitations mean your heart rate hits the higher limit and makes it tough for you to continue with your normal daily routine. Heart pounding causes many problems like fainting, chest pain, dizziness and huffing.
There can be many causes for your heart to pound (heart palpitations), but faulty lifestyle is considered a major factor in making you sick over time with palpitations. The cause of heart palpitations also includes high level of stress, which is one of the major reasons in today's world for palpitations, deteriorating health and diseases.
So, what exactly causes your heart to pound as if you have run a marathon? Given below are some major causes of heart pounding or palpitations:
In many cases, heart related reasons cause extensive pounding of the heart.
Abnormal levels of electrolytes can cause your heart to pound.
Certain medications, such as antibiotics, diet pills, asthma tablets or inhalers, may lead to heart pounding.
Dehydration can cause heart palpitations.
Drug abuse and drug dependence can cause your heart to pound.
Fever also increases your heartbeat.
High intake of alcohol can cause a pounding heart rate.
If you are having intense emotions and panic attacks then heart pounding is a common occurrence.
If you are into aggressive form of physical activity then also it can cause your heart to pound.
If you are on some additional supplements (herbal or medicated), then they can also cause your heart rate to increase.
Excessive caffeine intake causes your heart to pound.
In case you have an underactive thyroid, then it can cause heart palpitations.

Public Release: 22-Apr-2014
Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Study IDs surgical patients at risk
Mayo Clinic
Share
Print E-Mail
ROCHESTER, Minn. -- Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a leading cause of respiratory failure after surgery. Patients who develop the lung disorder postoperatively are at higher risk of dying in the hospital, and those who survive the syndrome may still bear its physical effects years later. A Mayo Clinic-led study is helping physicians better identify patients most at risk, the first step toward preventing this dangerous and costly surgical complication. They found nine independent risk factors, including sepsis, high-risk aortic vascular surgery, high-risk cardiac surgery, emergency surgery, cirrhosis of the liver, and admission to the hospital from a location other than home, such as a nursing home.
The findings are published in the journal Anesthesiology.
"This is a very common reason for needing an extended course of breathing support after surgery, and approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients who develop the syndrome will die from it," says first author Daryl Kor, M.D., a Mayo Clinic anesthesiologist. "It's well-documented that those who develop this syndrome stay in intensive care longer and in the hospital longer, and the impact of the syndrome can persist for many years."
Prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome has become a priority for the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the researchers noted.
To help prevent the condition, physicians first must identify who is most at risk, and that has proved difficult to do with individual patients, the researchers say. They studied 1,562 surgical patients considered at high risk of developing the syndrome, and found:
Acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in 117, or 7.5 percent.
Nine independent factors are predictors of the syndrome: sepsis; high-risk aortic vascular surgery; high-risk cardiac surgery; emergency surgery; cirrhosis; admission to the hospital unit from a location other than home, such as a nursing home or another hospital; increased respiratory rate; and two measurements that indicate hypoxemia, a lower-than-normal oxygen level in the blood.
Identifying those nine risk factors for surgical patients allowed researchers to refine previous risk prediction models; the new model can be used to identify high-risk patients before surgery for possible participation in acute respiratory distress syndrome prevention studies.
The findings may alter the way patients at high risk of the syndrome are cared for in the operating room, Dr. Kor says.
"For example, we may be a bit more conservative in the way we transfuse blood products. We may also ventilate their lungs in a little different way than we might if their risk score was low," Dr. Kor says. "We also hope that by identifying these high-risk patients, we might be able to better select a study population for future studies that look at specific prevention strategies. Before, such studies really weren't feasible because we couldn't identify high-risk groups with any degree of accuracy."
Future research may include studying the specific role that anesthetic care plays and whether aspects of care in the operating room should be modified in patients at high risk of developing the syndrome, Dr. Kor says.
###
Study co-authors included physicians and researchers from Mayo Clinic in Rochester and Jacksonville, Fla., and from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Brigham and Women's Hospital, University of Michigan School of Medicine and St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. The NIH-funded United States Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group collaborated on the study.
The study was supported by a career development grant from the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research in Rochester; by National Institutes of Health grants U01-HL108712-01, UL1 TR000135 and KL2 TR000136; and by the Mayo Clinic Critical Care Research Committee.

Amazon biodiversity hotspot to suffer even more losses after contentious law passed

In August 2017, the Bolivian government passed a contentious law that paved the way for construction of a new 190-mile road cutting through one of the country's most iconic and biodiverse protected rainforests. But a report in Current Biology on January 8 shows that the Isiboro-Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory (or TIPNIS, as the area is commonly known) has been subject to alarming levels of deforestation within its borders for many years, a reality that is too often overlooked.
TIPNIS, which is also the ancestral homeland of four lowland indigenous groups, lost more than 46,000 hectares of forest from 2000 to 2014, according to the report. (To put that in perspective, one hectare is about the size of a standard sports field.) The researchers say they hope the findings will help to give public debate on the matter a stronger foundation based on the best available evidence.
"While many discuss the potential impacts that the planned road could have in the future, very little is spoken about current ecological impacts in the area," says Álvaro Fernández-Llamazares from the University of Helsinki, Finland. "Our analyses show that TIPNIS is already facing rampant levels of deforestation."
It is well established that roads in tropical forests frequently lead to additional habitat conversion. In the case of TIPNIS, the researchers, including Mónica Moraes at Bolivia's Universidad Mayor de San Andrés, report that more than 58 percent of deforestation is found within five kilometers of existing roads. This trend suggests that the planned road will only "magnify the current scale and pace of deforestation in TIPNIS."
"We were surprised to discover that one of Bolivia's most iconic national parks could be facing such alarming levels of deforestation," Moraes says. That TIPNIS has lost more than 46,000 hectares of forest since the year 2000 "is simply unbelievable, considering that the park is not only one of the main biodiversity hotspots in Bolivia, but also one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth."
She notes that the area harbors many plant species that do not live anywhere else. It is also home to emblematic wildlife species, such as the jaguar, marsh deer, and giant otter.
While food security is often noted as justification for road building, the researchers add that most of the deforestation to date in TIPNIS is associated with cultivation of coca, not food crops. With expanded coca cultivation and new incentives for oil and gas exploration throughout Bolivia, they say that downgrading the legal protection of TIPNIS will most likely spur even greater biodiversity losses. The authors therefore call on Bolivia's government to revisit the road plans.
"Bolivian delegations have been very active in climate change negotiations and have vehemently advocated for the codification of the rights of Mother Earth in several international policy frameworks," Fernández-Llamazares says. "The road would most likely open a Pandora's box of environmental problems that, as a signatory of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Bolivia will surely struggle with."

Iran Parliament approves President Hassan Rouhani's picks for important ministries

Parliament speaker Ali Larijani says 225 of 276 lawmakers in attendance voted for Reza Ardakanian to serve as energy minister. Mansour Gholami secured 180 votes to serve as the minister of science, who is in charge of universities and higher education.
Though Iranian universities work under boards of trustees, hardliners do not support reformists for the post of science minister who has influence in picking university chancellors.
With today's vote, Rouhani's 18-minister cabinet is now complete.

Six die as protesters burn Bolivian government office | Reuters
World hidden Feb 18, 2016 03:31:52 IST
LA PAZ Six local government workers died of asphyxiation in the Bolivian city of El Alto after a group of protesters occupied and set fire to the municipal offices on Wednesday, El Alto's local government said.
Tensions are high in the country ahead of a national referendum on Sunday which will ask Bolivians if they wish to alter the constitution to allow President Evo Morales to run for a fourth term.
The municipal government of El Alto - a fast-growing satellite city of La Paz - said in a statement that six of its workers had died after the violent occupation of their offices by protesters with links to Morales' socialist party. El Alto is governed by the opposition.
Photos on local media showed the office building in flames.
Marcelo Elio, a home office deputy minister, accused El Alto's government of throwing boiling water on the protesters and causing the tragedy. "It is a plan orchestrated inside the local government," he said.
Rifts have deepened in recent months between supporters of Morales, who credit him with using a natural gas windfall to tackle poverty in one of South America's most deprived countries, and those who accuse his government of corruption and waste.
Critics say his attempt to change the constitution to allow him to stay in power until 2025 is anti-democratic. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, who was reelected to a third term in 2014, says a 'yes' vote is crucial to allow him to continue his social programs.

Lawmakers say Florida’s universities have a ‘systemic problem’ with spending

Details on proposals remain scarce as the annual legislative session prepares to start Tuesday. But Randy Fine, chairman of the House’ Higher Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said he wants to look into giving the Legislature more sway over the higher education budget and training for university officials who oversee school finances.

New Dynasonics TFX-500w Ultrasonic Flow Meter
Posted by: Sarah OBeirne in Building Services MIFM, Month in FM June 8, 2018	619 Views
Bell Flow Systems now offering the New Dynasonics TFX-500w Ultrasonic Clamp-on Flow Meter
Launched at the recent Hanover Messe exhibition in Germany, by US manufacturer Badger Meter. The new Dynasonics line product is a versatile, cost-effective solution for measuring water flow in industrial applications.
Providing an economical solution for measuring water flow bi-directionally in a variety of applications. This new model is remarkably easy to install – thanks to its clamp-on design. As a result, there is no requirement to tap or cut the pipe. Simply attach the meters sensors to the outer structure of the pipework to complete the installation. This makes the TFX-500w ideal for existing projects, as retrofitting to existing systems is simple and quickly completed, removing the requirement for any system shut down time. Furthermore, there is no loss of pressure as a result of the non-invasive design of this ultrasonic flow meter. The TFX-500w is capable of measuring flow rate, velocity and water flow with precision and accuracy. Finally, a large and user friendly display screen completes the design.
The TFX-500w is available in sizes 1/2 inch to 10 inch, and can function in a temperature range of -40 to 70 °C. It is capable of measuring flow from 0.38 to 37,000 L/min. Data communications options include Modbus RTU and BACnet MS/TP. It also supports full integration with the Badger Meter BEACON and AquaCUE Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) cloud-based software suites. The front panel buttons control the programming of the TFX-500w, or alternative by programming it via USB cable using SoloCUE configuration software.
Thanks to its flexible range of sizing and temperature handling abilities, the TFX-500w is an extremely versatile flow meter. The Dynasonics TFX-500w is well suited to a range of applications.

The 2 Companies That Led Today's Rally
Why Nike and Tiffany led today's rally.
John Maxfield
(JohnMaxfield37)
Mar 22, 2013 at 3:03PM
On an otherwise quiet day in terms of economic news, stocks are nevertheless up considerably thanks to better-than-expected earnings reports from consumer darlings Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Tiffany (NYSE:TIF). With roughly an hour left in the trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) is higher by 83 points, or 0.58%.
Shares of Nike are surging 11.6% after the company reported that its fiscal third-quarter earnings beat expectations. Analysts were particularly impressed by its performance in China. According to Bloomberg News, orders for the Nike brand in the world's second-largest economy increased last quarter after contracting during the two preceding time periods.
In addition, the sporting-goods company's gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.2%. "Nike is firing on all cylinders," an analyst quoted by Bloomberg said. "They've been talking about, for several years now, expecting gross margins to eventually turn. And now it looks like that has played out."
Shares of Tiffany & Co. are similarly up following the company's fourth-quarter earnings release. While its bottom-line figure rose by only 0.7% on a year-over-year basis, it was weighed down by "headquarters relocation costs," noted The Wall Street Journal. The market nevertheless responded favorably after the company reiterated its full-year guidance, even though it's forecasting an underwhelming first quarter. According to Michael J. Kowalski, Tiffany's chairman and chief executive officer:
These quarterly sales results were consistent with the holiday trends we had issued in early January. While financial results in fiscal 2012 were disappointing due to lower-than-expected sales growth and pressures on gross margin, we continued to maintain a longer-term focus on strengthening global awareness of the Tiffany & Co. brand and on further developing compelling product offerings.
Best- and worst-performing Dow stocks
In terms of Dow stocks, the index's best-performing component today is Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), which is up 2.9% in afternoon trading. As my colleague Dan Dzombak noted this morning, the ailing technology company held its annual shareholders meeting earlier this week. Among other issues on the agenda was a highly contested vote on whether three of the company's directors would be re-elected to the board after proxy firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended they be removed. While all three "squeaked by" with favorable votes of 54% to 58%, as Dan observed, "Typically, votes with less than a 70% majority are looked upon unfavorably."
Alternatively, the worst-performing stock on the Dow this afternoon is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), down by 1.1% at the time of writing. Scanning the news, there doesn't appear to be a specific catalyst to explain the weakness. Despite this, according to fellow Fool Matt Thalman, a "massive amount of uncertainty" continues to plague health care stocks as the industry adapts to Obamacare and changes to proposed payments under Medicare. It's for this reason that Matt implores new investors to "stay away from the company until its future is clearer."

"Once Explorers, Always Explorers"
The European Space Agency's science and exploration missions have been much in the news over the last couple of years, with the first results from its Gaia Milky Way surveyor and its LISA Pathfinder gravitational wave detection technology testbed, the arrival of its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli lander at the Red Planet, and the decade-long saga of the Rosetta comet-chasing spacecraft. Prof. Mark McCaughrean will give you an insight into some of these missions, their challenges, and their successes (as well as the almost-successes), and tell you what's coming next for ESA science and exploration, including new missions to study the Sun, Mercury, the Moon, Mars, and the wider Universe.
Glasgow Science Centre is proud to host the David Elder Lectures in partnership with the University of Strathclyde's Department of Physics. Some aspects of the lectures are technical and they are therefore most suitable for interested adults and older teenagers.
About the Planetarium
The Planetarium at Glasgow Science Centre has been upgraded to a spectacular, state-of-the-art, fulldome digital projection system (what a mouthful!). Our shows are live presenter-led or film based to take you on a journey through the solar system, into the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond, offering a truly out-of-this-world experience. Our spectacular full dome films display 360 degrees across the 15-metre hemispherical dome of the planetarium. It really is spellbinding stuff.

Kahlil Gibran on Love... ♥
Kahlil Gibran on Love
When Love beckons to you, follow him,
Though his ways are hard and steep.
And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
And when he speaks to you believe in him,
Though his voice may shatter your dreams
as the north wind lays waste the garden.
For even as Love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,
So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.
Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.
He threshes you to make you naked.
He sifts you to free you from your husks.
He grinds you to whiteness.
He kneads you until you are pliant;
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.
All these things shall Love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.
But if in your fear you would seek only Love's peace and love's pleasure,
Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of Love's threshing-floor,
Into the season-less world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.
Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
For Love is sufficient unto love.
When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, "I am in the heart of God."
And think not you can direct the course of Love, for Love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.
But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
To know the pain of too much tenderness.
To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;
To rest at the noon hour and meditate Love's ecstasy;
To return home at eventide with gratitude;
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

What does Capitalism mean to me?
I've been asked many times if I still track the stock market. My answer is a resounding yes. The stock market is in my blood. I'm still tracking the markets, still doing research and still following economic news. This is the one industry that is the heart of global productivity. It is essential in pumping the necessary oxygen (capital) to corporations that in turn hire employees who will in turn produce the products and services that we all use. Capitalism is a very very important element to humanity. It is what fuels dreams, self-reliance and individualism!

Commodities hammered by trade tariffs
Clare MacCarthy
Senior Editor, Saxo Bank
Share
The week ends on a sour note for commodities after US president Donald Trump signed off on his controversial tariffs on steel and aluminium, allowing them take effect in 15 days' time. Although Canada and Mexico have won temporary exemptions (while NAFTA negotiations continue), industrial metals are taking a beating and prices are down more than 10% on the week, says Ole Hansen, Saxo's head of commodity strategy.
"The trade talks and global tensions have really had an impact on commodities, especially industrial metals, which have dropped to their lowest since September," he says. Crude oil, gold, and copper are all suffering too for various reasons and are looking for support as the week draws to a close.
But the big focus today for commodities as well as virtually every other asset is the US nonfarm payrolls update for February and specifically, the data for average hourly earnings. "Today's US data is really important for seeing if the current USD uptick can sustain," says John J Hardy, Saxo's head of FX strategy. The consensus expectation is for a gain of 0.2% month-on-month and a 2.8% rise year-on-year. "A disappointment in either direction could be significant," Hardy says.
Peter Garnry, Saxo's head of equity strategy, says that ADP data have already indicated that the February payrolls numbers will be strong. "The deep link in the market right now – whether it's true or not – is the way investors are linking the interest rate trajectory to the wage numbers," he says.
And what of the pictures of Trump and Kim Jong Un that are dominating the front pages of the world's newspapers this morning? Well, Saxo's Hardy calls the planned meeting between the two leaders as "really unprecedented stuff" and "pretty high stakes" but points out that "the market effect is questionable even though the immediate response is risk-off". While the North Korean offer to meet could give Trump his "Nixon in China moment" there's much potential for things to unravel even before they begin...

Friday’s ugly session for equities and risk-correlated currencies has yielded to a swift change of direction yesterday and especially today, with the JPY going from strength to weakness and AUD and NZD poking up at breakout levels.
Equities
The six key topics on equity investors' minds
Equities plunged into late December 2018 and rebounded sharply in the first quarter of this year. Since then, however, the path has grown more muddled, volatility has risen and markets have become more nervous. What are the key areas of focus for investors looking to allocate from here?

Macro Brief: All about consumer confidence
Yesterday's mildly encouraging German economic data prints should be taken with a grain of salt and this scepticism will likely be confirmed by fresh data today.

Reported Rapes Go Through The Roof On Game Day At Big Football Schools
College football culture is causing hundreds of reported rapes every year, new research indicates.
By Maxwell Strachan
Jupiterimages/Getty Images
The people said to be largely responsible for the rise in game-day rapes were offenders the victims did not know.
The main findings:
Reported rapes rise by 41 percent on the day of home football games at FBS schools.
Reports of college-aged offenders raping college-aged victims rise by 58 percent on the day of home football games.
Reported rapes in which the victim doesn’t know the offender rise by 61 percent on the day of home games.
Football games appear to lead to as many as 770 rapes at FBS schools every year.
Home games at major college football schools are a breeding ground for sexual assault and are directly responsible for hundreds of additional rapes in the surrounding area every year, according to a new study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.
And there's an unlikely source behind the spike in rapes: People the victims do not know.
The researchers found that rapes reported by victims ages 17-24 increase by 28 percent on days when there are football games at Football Bowl Subdivision schools. FBS schools, previously known as D I-A schools, typically field the best teams in college football. Rape reports at FBS schools increase even more on days of home games, rising by 41 percent.
The study used FBI crime data collected between 1991-2012 from 138 local and campus law enforcement agencies to compare the number of rape reports on game days to the number on non-game days. The research accounted for the number of reported rapes that usually occur on a particular day of the week or at a time of the year, which would seem to correct for much of the football season taking place during what is known as "The Red Zone" between the start of school and Thanksgiving, when freshman women are particularly susceptible to assault.
In total, researchers were able to analyze 96 Division I football schools -- 55 of which were FBS schools and 41 of which were FCS or Football Championship Subdivision Schools, previously known as D-1AA schools.
“What we really wanted to do in this study is to quantify the degree to which partying and alcohol consumption actually cause increases in reports of rape, and that’s why we decide to investigate the effects of Division I football games," said Jason Lindo, an associate professor of economics at Texas A&M University and one of the study's co-authors.
The researchers estimate that football games could lead to as many as 770 rapes at the 128 schools that make up the FBS every year, and no fewer than 253. How far the estimate swings in either direction depends on how much you attribute the rise in reported rapes to the influx of people to the area on game day -- more people might just mean a higher chance of rape -- or to a change in behavior associated with alcohol consumption and party culture.
The increase is most apparent among college-aged adults between the ages of 17 and 24. The researchers estimated that reports of college-aged offenders raping college-aged victims rose by 58 percent on the day of home games. And while there was some evidence of an increase in rape victims between the ages of 25 and 28, almost none of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16.
Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations for the American Association Of University Women, was not as surprised by the report's top-line finding as she was by something else: The people said to be largely responsible for the rise in game-day rapes were offenders the victims did not know.
Researchers found that reported rapes involving an offender the victim didn’t know increased by 61 percent on home game days and by 29 percent during away games. By contrast, reported rapes involving an offender the victim did know rose by 28 percent during home games and by a statistically insignificant amount during away games.
Those numbers represent a startling spike in rapes by unknown offenders, since previous studies have shown that as many as 9 in 10 college-aged women victims know the person who assaulted them. This less-common type of rape seems much more prevalent on game days.
Researchers pointed to other signs that the increased rapes are tied directly to college football culture. Games against school rivals or prominent football programs seemed to lead to a steep rise in reported rapes, as did upset victories (notably, schools did not experience a significant rise in reported rapes when the opponent won in an upset). And while away games that were televised appeared to lead to a much smaller but still notable rise in reported rapes, this was not true of games that were not televised.
The effects were also felt much less at FCS schools, where football is a less prominent aspect of university life. There, home games appeared to lead to a 31 percent increase in reported rapes and away games had no effect. Division II and Division III games appeared to have no effect whatsoever on the number of reported rapes.
While the evidence is alarming, Maatz made sure to emphasize that this is not just a college problem or a football problem, but an American problem.
"[The problem] is just rape culture overall, and that’s not exclusive by any stretch to college campuses,” Maatz said. “It’s an important area of research but it does not solve the problem or answer all the questions.”

How to Make the Perfect Summer Movie in 5 Easy Steps

We’re hours away from Memorial Day weekend, which means we’re also hours away from the official start of summer movie season. In honor of this great annual tradition, I used this week’s Criticwire Survey to test a theory. “What,” I asked critics, “is the ‘perfect summer movie?'” Some named films that were about summer activities, one picked a movie that actually had the word “summer” in the title, but for the most part they confirmed my suspicion by choosing big summer blockbusters that all share a set of similar characteristics.
That suspicion: that the “summer movie” has become a genre unto itself. To better define this genre, I created the following how-to guide for filmmakers. If you can nail all five points on this list, you’ve got yourself a bonafide summer hit. All you need to do now is pick a post-Memorial Day release date and wait for the money to start rolling in.
1. Pick a subject that lends itself to horror-tinged action.
Critics cited a variety of genres in the survey, from comedy to thriller to live action cartoon, but all the movies that received multiple votes — “Independence Day,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Jaws,” “Jurassic Park,” and “Terminator 2: Judgement Day” — fill the viewer with an identical mixture of exhilaration and dread. You holler at Indiana Jones’ fistfight on the flying wing, then scream when the Ark starts blowing up Nazis. You cackle with glee when Arnold Schwarzenegger blows away the T-1000, then secretly grip your armrests during each glimpse of the future war against the machines. The perfect summer movie hits you on a gut level, or maybe several gut levels, and takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Actually, the roller coaster — that other beloved purveyor of summer entertainment — represents the ideal metaphor for the perfect summer movie: excitement and terror that’s safe for the whole family.
2. Don’t make it too smart.
By now, the ritual is codified: smart films in the fall, dumb ones in the summer. Or to put it another way: you don’t intellectualize the experience of being on a roller coaster. The entertainment provided by the perfect summer movie must be of the most mindless variety possible; a summer movie can be ruined by being too smart, but it can almost never be ruined by being too dumb. Notice, for example, the fact that “Star Wars” — the biggest franchise of all time, the film that, along with “Jaws,” basically created the modern summer movie season — didn’t get a single vote in my survey. Why? Maybe “Star Wars” is too good to demean with the title “summer movie.” It’s bigger and better than that, with loftier aspirations and headier themes. And who wants lofty aspirations and heady themes during the summer? The human brain, conditioned by childhoods spent at summer camp and the beach, still has an intense urge to take the summer off. The perfect summer movie indulges that urge for 100 minutes at a clip.
3. But DO make it in America.
The movies mentioned in my survey represented five decades of filmmaking by dozens of stars and directors, but they all came from just one country: America (eff yeah). The perfect summer movie is the apotheosis of Hollywood filmmaking — it’s big, it’s fun, it’s powerful, and, yes, oh-so-stupid. If aliens invaded or an asteroid headed for Earth, I would hope that the nations of the world would work together to create an international solution. But if we’re making a movie about those subjects, there’s only one nation I trust to create and solve the problem: the good ol’ U. S. of A. With respect to the great masters of foreign and arthouse cinema: we’ll see you in September.
4. Set it during the summer.
Perfect summer movies contains at least one interesting paradox: we go to see them to escape the heat, but tend to enjoy them more if they’re about people doing things outside; hanging at the beach (and running from a shark), celebrating July 4th (by blowing up extraterrestrial warships). Maybe the perfect summer movie makes us feel like were getting some kind of vicarious exercise without having to do any of the work. Maybe the crap that always seems to befall the characters in summer movies reassures us that our time is better spent indoors. Whatever the reason, nobody wants to watch a Christmas movie in July. (Sorry, “Christmas in July!”)
5. Wait ten years.
Two recent movies made the Criticwire Survey — “(500) Days of Summer” and “Attack the Block” — but otherwise, every other film that was mentioned was at least fifteen years old. Summers are about nostalgia — fondly remembering what it was like to be a kid free of work and responsibility — so it makes a lot of sense that the perfect summer movie would be whichever one we loved most as a kid and never forgot. In other words: “The Avengers” will probably top the perfect summer movie Criticwire Survey of 2032. It fits all five criteria perfectly.

After winning an Academy Award for her performance in last year’s “Room,” Brie Larson is one of the most sought-after performers in Hollywood. In addition to increasingly high-profile roles onscreen, she’s also leveraging her status by directing the upcoming comedy “Unicorn Store.” Her step behind the camera isn’t exactly unprecedented — Larson has has co-written and -directed two short films already, the first of which, “Weighting,” played at South by Southwest in 2013. Watch it below.

Larson also starred in the short, which she made with Dustin Bowser. A staff pick on Vimeo, “Weighting” comes with a simple premise — “She wants to go. He wants her to stay. Neither gets quite what they want” — and lasts a scant four minutes. The relationship drama gives the appearance on unfolding in one single take as Larson and co-star Satya Bhabha, playing a strained couple, talk through their problems in elevated dialogue.

In this text, I’ve steered a few of the businesses I think are going to be hot in 2016. These biblical ideas are being welcomed into the Body of Christ like never before and Christians in every single place are seeking opportunities for higher wealth and asking God to supply these blessings so that the Kingdom of God can advance in succession. I’ve had a house-based mostly enterprise of some form going on for years, including stitching!
When plotting the strengths with the alternatives, it turns into a a lot easier process to match your strengths with the opportunities which might be offered on the boards. Once the shop is opened and depending on the type of business you are operating; electrical energy, water, inventory and employees salaries are far more inexpensive compared to the United States. Click here for more info on alternatives for property rentals at Liverpool John Lennon Airport.
Foreclosures in Utah are creating an financial boon for entrepreneurs, who need to begin a business as brokers and buyers require companies to scrub or trash-out homes seized by lenders. Following the Long-Term Business Opportunity matrix, take a look at hyperlinks to DOE and other facility Forecasted/Business Opportunities webpages. Between the intricacies of social media velocity and the mysteries of growth hacking, business house owners have no clue the place to begin.
Before you sink cash into a business alternative, it’s a good suggestion perform a little research and get particular info from the promoter. And being enamored with his creation, he soon determined to go into the looking shoe business. I positively think it’s in the best interest to construct your viewers so you may market your corporation.
Some of the professionals of running a enterprise alternative are their much less restrictive nature when it comes to operation, branding and territory restrictions, their low preliminary funding fees and lack of ongoing fees. I arrange small business card show boards and assist individuals promote their business cards and amassing a monthly payment for it. A good small business that earns a couple of thousand dollars a month.

Why do the nations rage?
I don't know. Maybe because they're out of ammo culturally.
Recent news reports tell us that elderly pundit Dr. Jerome Corsi is facing prison time for getting tripped up in a perjury trap by grand inquisitor Robert Mueller. Corsi's actions, whatever the specifics, did not produce a victim.
Regardless of what you think of his politics, Corsi is facing the prospect of being locked up due to the game of DC blood sport. Seemingly half the country is foaming at the mouth at the sight of a political writer being caged because he favored their rivals' presidential pick.
The question is, does anyone want to live in a society where its law and liberty is decided by these violent bouts of scapegoat ping pong? Where do we get off this ride?
To exit the vehicle safely, we must know how we got in it, why it is breaking down, and why it is making us sick on its way out of commission.
The enigmatic Jewish prophet Habakkuk once wrote, “Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed and establishes a town by injustice!”
He wrote it at a time in which the world was filled with societies founded and mediated by controlled acts of bloodshed. Today, we call it ritual human sacrifice and tribal war campaigns for glory.
As sophisticated moderns, we’re embarrassed to address the seeming fluke of sacrifice so ubiquitous to human history, so we awkwardly shuffle it off to the corners of our museums. At best, the fashionable answer is that sacrifice was a quirk of religion or agriculture or proto-patriarchy or some other such cultural institution that soiled our primal nobility.
In reality, sacrifice was a safety valve ancient communities used to channel pent up resentment, fear, and conflict into misfit human vessels of destruction. These scapegoats were marked out from the masses by some arbitrary difference that made them unbearably peculiar to suspicious crowds looking to avert famine, disease, or other harbingers of social in-fighting and disorder.
We think we have educated ourselves out of human sacrifice, but this is a convenient myth we tell ourselves to justify its continual residue in our daily lives. A culture that sends state agents to lock up a woman selling unlicensed tamales or a political dissident or an addict or an Amish herbal salve seller is still very much enthralled by the one-for-all logic underlying our generative sacrificial origins.
Today, we hide our consent for coercion against misfits by telling ourselves it is for the protection of victims and children. As if, for example, another Amish farmer thrown into jail would cause the nation to perish if he was left alone to sell his raw milk.
Beyond domestic sacrificial violence in the name of victims, it is difficult to find a single country in existence today that did not have its founding determined by self-justifying war. As another remnant of sacred ritual, war has been a socially binding agent for societies: a means of uniting restless neighbors in righteous self-sacrifice of life and wealth for the defeat of a less-than-human foreign foe.
Yet recent years have shown that as the public is more frequently exposed to the images of constant intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Syria. Whatever unifying high war once held is rapidly dissipating.
Our increasing sensitivity to the plight of others make governance models built on the initiation of physical violence against nonviolent people increasingly ineffective. No wonder criminal justice reform and ending wars are now the few areas of overwhelming political unity.
Yet political systems, always in a lag from cultural trajectories are dramatically slow to decisively satisfy such popular demands.
A command-and-control economy where medical innovation and scientific reform are bugs to be blocked by bureaucracies simply has too much inertia built on the foundation of sacrificial wars and regulations to change its ways any time soon.
That's why Joe Quirk and the Seasteading project are such a fascinating case to consider. Quirk’s planned seasteads – floating platform-based ocean communities – could benefit the customers of monopoly governments by modeling nonviolent, voluntary community making. As sacrificial forms of governance continue to leave their citizens in disunity and resentment, we have a real chance to see the first sovereign societies develop free from bloodshed.
An ocean-platform community voluntarily funded and organized, if successful, is a monumental event in human anthropology.
Just having a place where problem solvers and innovators can develop potential breakthroughs in science, medicine, and innovation, free from deeply captured regulatory apparatuses could be a tremendous leap forward for mankind. And if these societies can maintain a thriving, non-state-managed existence, the rest of the world's governments will be on notice to wean themselves from sacrificial violence, rather than perish from increased social unrest and decline.
Competition may be a sin to John D. Rockefeller. But when it comes to bloated bureaucracies buoyed by outdated ways of treating human beings, it looks like a big beautiful blue ocean to me.

The Left should be paying attention to Florida. If you’ve ever desired a nightmarish vision of the legislature-driven austerity measures sure to proliferate around the country in the coming years, look no further than the Sunshine State’s 2012 budget. With little protest, Florida lawmakers are eviscerating public welfare and rapidly turning the state into a haven for the exploitation of workers. Despite the laughable “moderation narratives” now propagating in local newspaper coverage — which depict it as part of a trend away from rightist absolutism — the 2012 budget is nothing less than an unqualified victory for free market zealots everywhere: its legislatively-imposed austerity measures and multi-billion dollar tax cuts will no doubt serve as a useful model for other “business friendly” Southern states and the country as a whole.
For thirteen consecutive years, Republicans have controlled the governor’s office and both houses of the state legislature. Florida is effectively a one-party dictatorship: local papers treat any mild disagreement among the conservative faithful as evidence of moderate tendencies in the legislature. The reality is that Governor Rick Scott, elected during the 2010 wave of Tea Party victories, is so stridently right-wing (and the state Democrats so weak) that opposition to the leadership’s more draconian proposals inevitably comes from other Republicans. A few, such as centrist Paula Dockery, have fairly consistently voiced disapproval of their colleagues’ more egregious actions, but this dissent is highly circumstantial: decisive opposition to the notorious prison privatization plan, for instance, came from two Senators with direct ties to law enforcement. And the Parent Empowerment Act, a highly controversial proposal allowing for the swift conversion of neighborhood schools into publicly-funded charters via parental petition, was scuttled not by a united front of political moderates, but by intra-Republican skepticism.
As the national debate over forced transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated, new legislation is often tactically front-loaded with all sorts of detestable right-wing red meat. When a public outcry inevitably ensues, the offensive rider is excised with much fanfare, leaving the reactionary core intact. Immiseration goes down smoother if everyone can say they passed up at least one poisoned apple.
The 2012 Florida budget is a perfect example of this overarching strategy. On its own terms, it is a document of frightening severity, inflicted on a state with little risk of popular backlash. Scott and the Republican leadership may be widely despised, but the Sunshine State lacks the formations capable of challenging the imposition of austerity, such as what we’ve seen in Madison and Zucotti Park. I don’t want to downplay the noble efforts of the Floridian Occupiers (yes, they exist) but the state’s overwhelmingly suburban geography, its lack of density and dearth of prominent public space, prevents the sort of spectacular urban reclamation that made Occupy so compelling. And unionized public workers, the warp and woof of the Madison eruption, are a tiny minority of Florida’s total employed. Fittingly, the 2012 budget disproportionately harms university students and state workers, the two groups actively resisting the descent into austerity. From the Tampa Bay Times :
The 60-day legislative session that ended Friday was largely dominated by small reforms on a few pocketbook proposals. Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican-led Legislature honored their pledge not to raise taxes, an article of faith for them in an election year. But to fill a $2 billion budget gap, they cut about $300 million from universities and colleges, $1 billion from state worker pensions, and made another round of deep spending cuts in prisons, health care and social services.
That $300 million figure is a bit misleading. The actual, aggregate cut to students is far deeper if you include the decrease in financial aid ($487 million or 4.4%) and the inevitable tuition hikes of 5% (for community college students) and 15% (for university students). Technically the budget only “allows” for such drastic increases, but Florida’s eleven state universities have consistently hiked up tuition by 15% for each of the past four years. Compared nationally, Florida tuition is still relatively cheap, a fact constantly cited by rate hike apologists, including university presidents. Scott claims to oppose tuition increases (although he has happily signed off on them), but may support a bill allowing the University of Florida and Florida State University to increase tuition further, towards an ill-defined but substantially higher “market rate” for higher education. As for state workers — who haven’t had a raise in six years — the brutal $1 billion pension cut is accomplished through a continuing 3% salary reduction, recently ruled unconstitutional but currently under appeal. The budget also liquidates 4,355 state jobs, an odd maneuver for a governor supposedly interested in “getting Florida back to work” and facing a 9.6% unemployment rate. Workers still employed by the state will now be subject to random drug tests (politicians excluded, of course) in an attempt to stamp out “abusers,”whatever that means.
Not content with sacrificing students and state employees to their experiment in austerity, the sick and the elderly are also in for a dose of the legislature’s tough love. Medicaid funds for hospitals and nursing homes will be cut by $340 million. Like much of the budget, this is actually a deepening of 2011’s cuts (about $700 million): in sum, that’s a deprivation of more than $1 billion in medical support for residents most in need of publicly-funded health care. Urban hospitals, many of them in the populous southeastern corridor, will bear the brunt of the overall cut.
The budget’s widely touted expenditures are in fact little more than a crude attempt at sustaining the veneer of publicly funded social goods. Florida narrowly dodged $100 million in cuts to mental health and substance abuse programs, once again through a last-ditch ad hoc coalition: a motley crew of law enforcement officials, Republican politicians, health care advocates, and members of the judiciary successfully lobbied for funding that approximates 2011 levels. Florida’s per-capita mental health financing is already ranked 50th in the US, and deep cuts would have had immediate disastrous effects across the state. Even redneck county sheriffs recognize the apocalyptic shadings of forcing hordes of the mentally ill to roam the state’s multitudinous strip malls.
In terms of primary and secondary education, the budget’s much-vaunted $1.1 billion increase in funding doesn’t even offset last year’s $1.35 billion cut. Politicians have been praising this awkward bit of sleight-of-hand as a boon for public education and local papers sometimes mention the funding boost with shocking historical blindness, blissfully ignoring the overall loss of $250 million. That deficit will grow as more students enroll: Seminole County is already predicting teacher layoffs; Orange County Schools may end up $25 million in the red. And even with PEA’s demise, the budget still includes $55 million for charter school construction. Traditional public schools? $0. Privatization marches on.
So, who benefits from this austere budget and its accompanying legislation? Not surprisingly, capitalists of all shapes and stripes. In 2012, businesses will receive $750 million in tax “relief,” with $2.5 billion in further tax cuts accruing over the next few years. With recent history in mind, the Tampa Bay Times reports:
After his election in 2010, Scott launched a plan to create 700,000 jobs in seven years, with the cornerstone being a multibillion-dollar push to slash business taxes. At the top of the list: phasing out the state’s 5.5 percent corporate income tax. The Legislature surged ahead with that plan this year, approving a $50,000 exemption to the tax, doubling last year’s cut and taking nearly 4,000 more businesses off the tax rolls. The corporate tax cut, valued at nearly $30 million, is part of a $150 million tax relief package backed by Scott that includes breaks for manufacturing equipment ($56.4 million), private planes ($12.3 million), and tangible personal property ($20 million).
Before you start shaking with rage at a government which fires teachers while giving a tax break to owners of private planes, bear in mind that it only eliminates sales taxes on repair and parts. The rich, graciously acknowledging that they must contribute their fair share, are frugally tuning up their old planes instead of purchasing ostentatious new ones. We all have to make sacrifices if we’re going to pull through the Great Recession.
The full list of tax breaks paints a grotesque but accurate portrait of the diverse subgroups within Florida’s bourgeoisie: faux-populist ranchers, managerial charter profiteers, neo-Confederate citrus plantation owners, still-panicked real estate swindlers eager to take a mulligan and rewind to 2005. But Scott’s plan — which may eventually eliminate corporate taxes entirely in a right-to-work state that already lacks a personal income tax — is the Hayekian wet dream everyone in Florida’s ruling class freak show can agree on. Banks got in on the feeding frenzy too:
Lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature went above and beyond Scott’s proposed cuts, offering a cornucopia of tax reductions and incentives worth several billion dollars over the next few years. A $1.5 billion tax credit program was unveiled and passed in the final hours of the session. It was pitched as a way to help shore up Florida’s undercapitalized insurance market. Senate budget Chairman JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, said the idea came from “one of the big banks.” The program could net $225 million in fees for the bank that ends up managing the program. Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, R-Fort Lauderdale, got lawmakers to sign off on a last-minute $830 million package of temporary reductions in unemployment compensation taxes for employers. While state economists say the cut could leave Florida undercapitalized if another recession hits, the business community hailed it as a huge win.
Indeed. The business lobby can barely contain their glee: the Florida Chamber of Commerce, the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, and the Associated Industries of Florida have all declared victory and moved on to funding candidates in the 2012 elections. The FCofC had a particularly successful year, ramming twenty-five supported bills, provisions, and other items through the legislature. Their recently-released “legislative summary” celebrates the session as a hard-fought capitalist triumph over the Floridian working class: “Despite a $2 billion budget gap, the challenges of redistricting, an election season and the distraction of the attempted expansion of Las Vegas-style casino gambling,” they write, “lawmakers furthered the Florida Chamber’s goal of securing Florida’s future by ending the 2012 Legislative Session without a single new tax, higher fee, new regulation or union-backed mandate.”
Meanwhile, lack of revenue is crippling less affluent counties, which, following the collapse of the housing market, can no longer rely on property taxes as a reliable source of income. Polk, my former county of residence, has lost $96 million in recurring operating revenue due to the diminution of property values since 2007. The loss of those funds — combined with state-imposed tax cuts and pervasive anti-tax doxa among county officials — means more jobs and service cuts are on the horizon.
The situation in Florida is indisputably dire and almost certain to devolve further. The 9.6% unemployment rate, down a smidgen from 11.1% when Scott took office, remains well above the national average. In many counties, unemployment is far worse. Polk’s rate, for example, currently stands at 10.5%, a comparative “improvement” likely due to the addition of temporary, seasonal jobs in agriculture and frustrated unemployed workers simply giving up the search. Scott’s stated ambition of adding 700,000 jobs (in the private sector, of course) remains a pipe dream: according to recent figures, only 54,200 jobs — many of them low-wage—have been added since his governorship began. But this may be the point: a standing army of the unemployed — many of whom have been recently tossed out of decently-paying government jobs—will continue to drive down wages in a state whose annual mean income is $4,000 lower than the national average. The current despotic pivot should be obvious to anyone familiar with structural adjustment: having fully consolidated their political power, the capitalist class is moving to enact the strategic and long-term immiseration of Florida workers. The sunny suburban locale of this political-economic laboratory shouldn’t isolate it from our critical gaze. Marked by a liquidation of the public sector, the destruction of pensions and facilities for the aged, an explosion of student-borne costs in higher education, and intense competition for jobs by desperate workers on the brink of pauperism, Florida’s predicament is a tiny slice of Greece in the Most Magical Place on Earth. Teetering on the brink of the nineteenth century, its regressive future may be ours too: it’s a small world after all.

Jews along with Christians, and not just Muslims, could be prohibited from immigrating to the US under a proposed ban by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, his running mate Mike Pence indicated Monday.
Without specifically mentioning the two religions, the conservative Indiana governor said the proposed temporary ban on immigrants from areas "compromised by terrorism" would apply to individuals of all religions.
Pence made the remarks in response to a question on the Wisconsin-based 'Midday with Charlie Sykes' radio show about the religious affiliation of potential immigrants who would be barred from entering the US under the Trump campaign's suggested plan.
"So there's no longer a temporary proposed ban on Muslims, it would be anyone from those countries including Christians...Jews?" the program's host asked Pence.
The Republican vice presidential hopeful responded by saying a policy that prohibited all individuals from "compromised" territories was, for now, "appropriate."
“I think what you heard in the convention speech from Donald Trump, what we talked about out on the stump is that we would temporarily suspend from countries, or territories if you will — the caliphate obviously of ISIS expands beyond one country — but to say that individuals that come from regions or countries that have been compromised by terrorism, that we would expand that immigration. I think that’s appropriate until we develop a new vetting system," he said on the radio show.
Pence, who initially condemned Trump's controversial stance on banning Muslims, then went on to note his contested decision as Indiana governor to suspended a program allowing Syrian refugees to settle in the Midwestern state.
Discussion on the contested ban of Muslims opened with the radio program's host Charlie Sykes asking Pence on his views of "singling out one religion" when he labels himself as an "advocate of religious freedom."
A nation-wide debated erupted over Pence's 2015 so-called 'Religious Freedom Restoration Act' that critics charged would provide legal backing for businesses that refuse services, particularly to people from the LGBT community, based on religious credence.

Company History
Konica Minolta had its beginnings in the 19th century - and ever since, has been synonymous with quality, innovation and leadership.
The company we know today as Konica Minolta started as two separate businesses - Konica and Minolta - which merged in 2003.
Konica
In 1873, a Japanese man named Rokusaburo Sugiura began selling photographic materials at his Tokyo apothecary - Konica. By the beginning of the 20th century, the company had developed its first camera and a range of quality photographic products. In 1971, Konica released Japan’s first plain paper photocopier, developing a dominant position in high speed, high quality document management systems and imaging products.
Minolta
Minolta was founded in 1928 to manufacture cameras and then to pioneer related technologies. This included a latent image transfer system, the world’s first magnification and reduction photocopier, and the world’s first photocopier to produce two-colour images in a single pass. Minolta went on to achieve a strong global presence as a pioneer in the field of high quality imaging technology.
Konica Minolta
In 2003, both companies came together - and became a technology force to be reckoned with.
The early, pioneering spirit in both companies lives on today - and is reflected by our research and development division, which continually reaches into new areas of knowledge.
Today, Konica Minolta is expert in 12 core technologies – including materials, optics, nano-fabrication and imaging. It is this passion for excellence in new technologies that ensures we continue to be a world-leader in research.

Toyota investing $750M at 5 US plants, creating 600 jobs
Toyota logo / Courtesy: MGN
By JOHN RABY and BRUCE SCHREINER, Associated Press |
Updated: Thu 3:41 PM, Mar 14, 2019
BUFFALO, W.Va. (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. on Thursday announced it is investing an additional $750 million at five U.S. plants that will bring nearly 600 new jobs, including the production of two hybrid vehicles for the first time at its Kentucky facility.
It marks yet another expansion of the Japanese automaker's U.S. presence, bringing to nearly $13 billion the amount it will spend by 2021.
The latest investments are at facilities in Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia. Those same facilities were part of a 2017 announcement by Toyota for a $374 million investment to support production of its first American-made hybrid powertrain.
President Donald Trump congratulated Toyota on Twitter and tried to tie the announcement to his efforts on trade.
Referring to an agreement with Canada and Mexico that would replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump said: "BIG NEWS for U.S. Auto Workers! The USMCA is already fixing the broken NAFTA deal."
The revised version of NAFTA negotiated by the Trump administration, regarded by many as a modest recasting of the original agreement, has not been approved by Congress.
The president made no mention when a Chevrolet Cruze factory in Ohio recently closed, the first of five North American plants that GM intends to shut down by early next year.
Toyota Motor North America executive Chris Reynolds said the investments represent yet more examples of the company's long-term commitment to build where it sells, irrespective of trade uncertainty due to tariffs.
"Our overarching manufacturing principle is if we can sell it here we need to make it here. That's been true before any tariff uncertainty, it's true during tariff uncertainty and it will be true after. Our investment cycles go beyond any particular political cycle," he said during a conference call with reporters.
Toyota Motor North America CEO Jim Lentz said the driving force behind the overall investment has been consumers' "insatiable appetite" for light trucks over passenger cars, pointing to Highlander and RAV4 production and past pickup truck production.
"But I'd be disingenuous if I didn't say we also have an eye on trade," Lentz said. "USMCA is part of that. But these decisions we're making today are really driven by consumers and our product portfolio going forward, for the most part."
The automaker is spreading the additional investments among several plants.
Toyota's Georgetown, Kentucky, facility will get a $238 million infusion to produce hybrid versions of Lexus ES 300 sedans starting in May and the RAV4 SUV starting in January 2020, the company announced.
The RAV4 production doesn't signal a shift away from sedan production at the sprawling Kentucky plant, Toyota executives said. Instead, it reflects Toyota's plan to build multiple vehicles at its plants to better insulate each facility from downturns in market cycles.
"Unlike some of our competitors, we think there's value in the sedan market, while it may not be as big as it was," Reynolds said.
The announcement also includes $288 million to increase annual engine capacity at Toyota's Huntsville, Alabama, facility. The plant will add 450 jobs to accommodate new four-cylinder and V6 engine production lines. Last year Toyota and Mazda announced plans to build a $1.6 billion joint-venture plant in Huntsville that will eventually employ about 4,000 people.
Toyota also is spending $62 million on equipment to boost production of Toyota and Lexus cylinder heads at its Bodine Aluminum facility in Troy, Missouri, as part of its cost-saving New Global Architecture production strategy to share common parts and components among different vehicles.
A $50 million expansion and equipment upgrade at a Bodine plant in Jackson, Tennessee, will add 13 jobs and produce engine blocks while doubling the capacity of hybrid transaxle cases and housings.
And Toyota will add 123 jobs and spent $111 million to expand its plant and purchase equipment in Buffalo, West Virginia, to double the capacity of hybrid transaxles.
Previously, Toyota also announced a $600 million investment at its Princeton, Indiana, plant to increase the capacity of its Highlander SUV and to incorporate the new production strategy, and $170 million to launch the 2020 Corolla on a new production line in Blue Springs, Mississippi.

Description
In Contracts Stories, the editors are joined by other leading contracts scholars in taking the major cases in contract law -- from Britton v. Turner to Red Owl to Pro-CD to Baby M -- and putting them in their historical and cultural context.
This book brings together a broad array of contracts scholars. Each of the eleven short and readily accessible chapters provides newly uncovered facts about and insights into the cases that lie at the core of the first-year contracts class. Long-standing puzzles are answered (such as the identity of Louise Hamer and why the nephew transferred his claim to her after his uncle died in Hamer v. Sidway and why a bridge to nowhere was built in Luten Bridge). These answers in turn are linked to the larger political and social forces at work, and the way these forces have shaped the evolution of contract law.
In this offering, the editors are joined by other leading contracts scholars in placing the major cases in contract law in their historical and cultural context. Each of the 11 short and readily accessible chapters provides newly uncovered facts about and insights into the cases that lie at the core of the first-year contracts class. Long-standing puzzles are answered and these answers in turn are linked to the larger political and social forces at work, demonstrating how these forces have shaped the evolution of contract law.

We value your business and want you to have the best possible renting experience. We provide this "plain-English" rental agreement to help you understand everything involved in the rental process. Please read carefully prior to each time you transact with us. The terms of our Rental Agreement/Service Policy (“Agreement”) may change over time.

21. Governing Law
1. No Obligation To Sell Mispriced Products Or Services.
BarristerBooks shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders for any lawful reason, including without limitation products/services listed at an erroneous price, rebate or refund, or containing any other incorrect terms, information or typographical errors, or orders involving potential fraud or account abuse as determined by BarristerBooks in its sole discretion. BarristerBooks shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit/debit card charged. If your credit/debit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, BarristerBooks will promptly issue a credit to your credit/debit card account in the amount of the charge.
2. Pricing and Availability
BarristerBooks offers a large number of products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products listed on the Site may be unavailable from time to time. Since we have multiple supply sources and are constantly updating our inventory, our pricing may change upon checkout. Because of this, prices and availability of products on the Site are subject to change without notice. Please be sure to confirm the price stated at checkout – that is the price you will be charged.
Products may rent quickly and therefore there may be a change in the product’s availability from the time the product has been placed in a “cart” but before an order has been submitted. Similarly, you should understand that the pricing of products is dynamic and constantly changing based on many factors including product demand and availability, such that there may be instances where you are able to place a product in your “cart”, but upon submitting your order for processing, the pricing for such product may have changed. You agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring that any applicable pricing listed with respect to products in your order is acceptable to you immediately prior to submission of an order for processing. Upon submission of the order, you are solely responsible for all costs, charges and fees resulting therefrom.
On rare occasions, you may receive notice that an item listed on your order receipt has become out of stock. You agree that we may rescind our acceptance and we may cancel any product(s) in your order without penalty if we are unable to ship the product you ordered due to unavailability.
3. Returning Books
Your rental books should be postmarked by the last day of your rental period. We consider “postmarking” to be the act of printing your pre-paid shipping label and delivering your rental return shipment to UPS. All items that originally came with the book, such as, CDs, DVDs, access codes, inserts, workbooks, study guides, etc., must be returned with the book.
BarristerBooks is not responsible for any return shipment that does not follow our return procedures. This includes shipments that do not use a BarristerBooks UPS pre-paid shipping label. If you choose not to utilize a BarristerBooks return pre-paid shipping label, BarristerBooks will not reimburse you for return shipping costs. You are not allowed to request pick up. If you do, you will be charged for the associated cost.
Please note that our website may be down occasionally for regular maintenance during off-peak hours. We try to keep downtime as short and infrequent as possible, but it is always best to print your return shipping label a couple days before you plan on sending back your books. BarristerBooks is not responsible for books that are returned late due to Site maintenance.
4. Rental Period
Your rental begins on the date your book is delivered, based on your tracking number, and must be shipped back to us by the last day of your rental period, as noted on your order confirmation screen, order confirmation email and in your Customer Account. Otherwise, you will be charged accordingly (see the following section: Books Not Returned By Due Date/Automatic Extensions and Buyouts section).
5. Books Not Returned By Due Date/Automatic Extensions and Buyouts
If your book is not shipped back to us by your rental due date of your rental period, you may automatically be charged an additional 10% of your rental as a late fee. If your book has still not been shipped back to us by the 14th day after the due date of your initial rental period, you may automatically be charged the “buyout price”. The buyout price equals the publisher list price of a new copy of the book plus any applicable sales tax, minus what you’ve already paid to rent the book, including any paid rental extensions and late fees. When we say “shipped back” we mean that your pre-paid UPS shipping label must have been printed and your return shipment accepted by UPS.
A rental buyout occurs in one of three ways: (1) you may elect a buyout at any time by contacting us directly (although some titles are not eligible for buyout); or (2) a buyout will be deemed to have occurred if the book has not been returned within the 14-day post-due date period described above. Once you pay the buyout price of a book, it becomes your property.
If you have not returned the book by the due date and we are unable to charge your credit/debit card, it is your responsibility to pay the fee immediately. You will be notified via email if your credit/debit card was declined. If you do not pay all amounts due within 7 days of notice of the declined charge, BarristerBooks will turn your account over to a third-party collection agency.
6. Purchasing Your Rental
You have the option of buying out your rental. If you want to buy out your rental, you will be charged the publisher list price of a new copy of the book plus any applicable sales tax, minus what you’ve already paid to rent the book, including any rental extensions or late fees. Certain titles are not eligible to be bought out.
To buy a book you are renting, please contact us directly at [email protected] or 1-866-808-5635 (M-F 9am-5pm CST).
7. Extending Your Rental
If you wish to keep your rental past its due date, you can choose to extend your due date in the View Cart section of Checkout. If you wish to extend your rental after you have already taken possession of the rental item, please contact us directly [email protected] or 1-866-808-5635. Additional charges may apply to rental extensions.
8. Title
During your rental period, all rental items remain the exclusive property of BarristerBooks. Your acceptance of the rental item and paying rental fees entitles you only to limited use of BarristerBooks’s property for a specified amount of time and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. At the end of the rental period, you have no further right to use/possess the rental item.
9. Lost Books
During the rental period you are deemed to be solely responsible for the rented item, and you are responsible if it is damaged, lost or stolen (whether or not caused by you). If you do not return the item at the end of your rental period, your credit/debit card will be charged the corresponding buyout price (see the Books Not Returned By Due Date Section above).
10. Damaged Books Returned
Except for items rented under the Aspen Connected Casebook program (which have no damage, writing or highlighting restrictions, and are not subject to the terms of this section), all rental items are required to be kept in the same condition in which they are received (absent normal wear-and-tear and moderate writing/highlighting). If a rental item is returned to us as damaged and rendered unusable, it will remain the property of BarristerBooks and you may be charged an amount up to the buyout price for the item. You are responsible for damage caused during the rental period and in transit back to BarristerBooks because of insufficient/improper packaging.
You agree that BarristerBooks’ evaluation of an item’s condition shall be final and binding.
Required Condition - No Damage Fee: The item has a firm cover with no noticeable damage. All pages must be intact. There can be moderate writing or highlighting, but no damage to the binding.
Unacceptable Condition - Damage Fee Applies: The cover is noticeably damaged or missing. Pages are stained, missing, illegible, or otherwise warped. There is heavy writing and/or highlighting throughout the item. Any other condition that renders the item unusable, including exposure to chemicals, perfumes, cleaning agents, or tobacco, smoke etc. that causes any noticeable odor, may result in additional fees.
In the event you incur a damage fee, and are charged the buyout price for the book, you have the option to have the damaged item shipped back to you at your expense. You must contact Customer Service within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the day you are charged the damage fee to arrange (and pay) for the damaged book to be shipped to you. If you do not provide BarristerBooks with shipping instructions and payment within this time, the damaged item will be considered permanently and irrevocably abandoned by you. Accordingly you will automatically forfeit any and all right, title or interest in the item. The abandoned item will then be recycled, donated or otherwise disposed of in a manner of BarristerBooks’s choosing without further notice or obligation to you.
11. Highlighting/Writing
Except for items rented under the Aspen Connected Casebook program (which have no damage, writing or highlighting restrictions, and are not subject to the terms of this section), moderate levels of writing and highlighting are allowed. If an item is returned with a copious amount of writing or highlighting, as determined by BarristerBooks in its sole discretion, a damage fee may be charged (see section Books Not Returned By Due Date/Automatic Extensions and Buyouts above).
12. What We Rent
We only rent items that can be reused; workbooks, study guides, laboratory manuals, periodicals, and other consumable materials are not rented. Furthermore, we do not guarantee that access codes/keys/cards, CDs, DVDs, workbooks, or any other type of supplemental material will come with your items, purchased or rented. If an item you rent from BarristerBooks arrives with a supplement, you are allowed to use it at no extra cost. At the end of the rental, all supplemental material must be returned with the item rented.
13. Aspen Connected Casebooks™
If you are renting one or more Aspen Connected Casebook™ items, in addition to both the general, as well as the Connected Casebook™-specific, terms mentioned elsewhere in this agreement, please note that i) this agreement does not make any warranties regarding the Aspen Connected Casebook™ items and ii) you grant BarristerBooks the right to provide the publisher of Aspen Connected Casebook™ items with your email address solely for the purpose of enabling, administering and providing you support for your access to the digital functions of the Aspen Connected Casebook™ items.
14. Intellectual Property
All rented items are protected by applicable copyright and contain proprietary information and material that is owned by BarristerBooks and/or its licensors, suppliers or agents. Books/materials should not be used in any way whatsoever except in compliance with the terms of this Agreement without express written permission from BarristerBooks. No portion of any rented item may be reproduced in any form or by any means, except as expressly permitted hereunder. You agree not to copy, scan, photocopy, modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, reproduce, or create derivative works based on the rented items, in any manner, or otherwise commercially exploit the rented items. BarristerBooks reserves the right to terminate your account and rental if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that you are in violation of these terms. BarristerBooks does not promote, foster or condone the copying of CDs, written publications, or any other rented items nor does it condone any other infringing activities. The use of CDs and publications rented to you is solely for your personal and non-commercial use. ANY OTHER USE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND INFRINGES ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND MAY SUBJECT YOU TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE MONETARY DAMAGES, FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.
BarristerBooks trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the services provided hereunder are trademarks or registered trademarks of BarristerBooks. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the rented materials may be the trademarks of their respective owners. You are not granted any right or license with respect to any of the aforesaid trademarks, graphics, logos, etc.
15. Payment/Collection Information
Your credit/debit card and other billing information is not held on file by BarristerBooks, but is securely held by PayPal, our credit card processor, until all rental items in an order are closed (i.e. each item is returned, or bought-out and all fees paid). BarristerBooks reserves the right to attempt a re-charge of a declined credit/debit card periodically, at any time and for any number of attempts, to collect amounts outstanding on your account. BarristerBooks is not responsible for overdraft or other penalties/fees a customer may incur for such charges (or attempted charges). In any collections action, the person listed under the Billing Information of an account is ultimately responsible for payment. BarristerBooks reserves the right to use a collection agency and any other means necessary to recover lost assets or any payments due.
16. Third Party Collection
BarristerBooks reserves the right to provide third parties with information relevant to the collection of any amounts due for rental items not returned, extended without approval, or damaged beyond terms. You consent to the disclosure of your personal information to collect delinquent fees outstanding, protect or enforce our rights, protect or enforce the rights of a third party, or as may be required by law.
17. Refunds
If you wish to return a rental for a refund, you can do so within 30 days of your order date, by following our standard Return Policy (see our Return FAQs). Once your return is received and processed, you will be refunded for the price of the item(s) paid plus any applicable tax. Shipping costs are not refunded (unless you are returning due to a BarristerBooks’ error as described below). Once the return has been processed, a refund will be posted to the credit/debit card you used to place your order. It normally takes 5-7 business days for financial institutions to process this transaction.
Refusing delivery is not an acceptable way to return a rental item, for a refund or at the end of the rental period. BarristerBooks is not responsible for items that are "returned to sender." If an item's delivery is refused for any reason, BarristerBooks will make every effort to refund the customer as soon as BarristerBooks, or its agent, has received and successfully processed the refused shipment. There is, however, no guarantee when and if the refused shipment will be successfully processed.
18. Due to BarristerBooks' Error
If BarristerBooks makes a mistake with your order (e.g. you receive books that do not match your order or books with major damage, as determined by BarristerBooks), we will gladly provide a refund. BarristerBooks does not guarantee that rental items come with inserts or supplements. For this reason, it is not considered a BarristerBooks error if a rental item does not come with an insert/supplement or additional material.
Items are no longer eligible for a refund if it’s been more than 30 days since the order date; in addition, if the item is returned to us damaged or not in its original condition, a refund will not be issued.
19. Returning Books Not Rented From BarristerBooks
BarristerBooks is not responsible for any items sent to us in error. BarristerBooks will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any extra books received, but we cannot guarantee such items will ever be identified or recovered. If an extra item shipped to us in error is identified and available to be returned, you may request its return in writing. You will be responsible for and agree to pay all fees associated with the recovery and return shipping of such items. The risk of damage/loss/delay for books sent to us in error is at all times yours alone. BarristerBooks shall not be liable in any way for the care/custody of non-BarristerBooks property, and you agree to hold BarristerBooks harmless for any damage/loss/delay, etc. incurred by you or any person related to or arising out of items shipped to BarristerBooks in error.
20. Changes
By placing a rental order with BarristerBooks you consent to this Agreement, which may be amended by us from time to time; provided that, the version of this Agreement in place at the time of an applicable rental transaction will govern that rental transaction to its completion. If we amend this policy, we will post any changes to this page so that you are always aware of the current terms and conditions. Please refer to this page prior to making any transaction so you remain up to date with the most recent terms and conditions.
21. Governing Law
You agree that any claim relating to BarristerBooks shall be governed by the laws of the State of Kansas without regard to its conflict of law provisions and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction over you and such claims, and to venue of such claims, being in the State of Kansas.

Our History
What We Believe
Our purpose is to improve the overall wellness of family members, including our beloved dogs and cats. We believe optimal health starts within the four walls of your home. We strive to help each and every inhabitant live a fully abundant life.
What is a fully abundant life? It’s the delicate balance of nutrition, physical wellness, mental well-being, environmental health and financial goals.
Most people are well-aware that in order to be healthy, they need to eat well and exercise. But we at Life’s Abundance believe that nutrition and physical wellness go beyond grabbing an apple a day or logging a quick walk. It’s a lifestyle. We want to help you seamlessly make the right choices that can improve your overall health for the long term.
Everyday stresses take their toll on a body. We believe it’s possible to not only manage these strains but also to thrive through healthy living. Strong mental health is a wondrous result of good nutrition and physical well-being.
We firmly believe that your body is your temple. But your temple is also your temple! Environmental health is the foundation of a healthy home. Toxins from household cleaners and air fresheners are proven detriments to your physical and mental health. And dogs and cats are not immune to the ill effects of chemical lawn treatments that end up on their paws or harsh chemicals that they might lick off a freshly mopped floor. Life’s Abundance wants our families to be mindful of not only what they put in their own bodies but also how they treat those four walls that contain their hearts.
At Life’s Abundance, we work hard to make sure the products we offer are a very good value, but making healthy choices can be a strain on the budget. That’s why we provide financial opportunities for people to share and recommend our products so they can afford to bring health-promoting products into their lives.
Each of these tenets alone cannot make a person healthy. There needs to be a balance of all five — and Life’s Abundance’s goal is to help our customers achieve it.

Introducing Harmony By PointClickCare – A New Way To Realize Interoperability
ORLANDO, FLA.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Global Conference & Exhibition – PointClickCare, the leading cloud-based software vendor for the long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) market, is previewing a new interoperable solution designed to empower hospitals and health systems with the insights required for a truly coordinated and collaborative approach to care delivery. Harmony by PointClickCare, the new solution, will enable acute and post-acute care providers to eliminate data silos between care partners and leverage meaningful insights.
Harmony by PointClickCare
Harmony by PointClickCare connects acute and post-acute care providers on a secure, simplified, and integrated platform. Its features empower hospitals and health systems to more easily:
Locate where their patients are, as well as facilitate seamless, integrated transitions to LTPAC settings.
Sync with meaningful data exchange between care settings to conveniently monitor their discharges to LTPAC facilities and access up-to-date, detailed patient progress information for efficient decision-making.
Visualize LTPAC partner’s key performance indicators and metrics through a single glass-pane view, thereby enabling easy evaluation and real-time visibility on patient discharges.
PointClickCare Highlights
PointClickCare is in a leading position to help acute care providers effectively connect with LTPAC providers. According to CMS and PointClickCare system data:
In 2017, more than 97 percent of hospitals referred at least one Medicare patient to a facility that uses the PointClickCare platform.
From 2012 to 2017, facilities that use the PointClickCare platform saw a growth of 186 percent in their Medicare referrals.
In 2018, 2.4 million admissions went to a post-acute care facility that utilizes the PointClickCare platform.
Comments on the News
"The transition to LTPAC facilities is becoming increasingly important for health systems as they look to reduce costs and improve care outcomes,” says Luke Bonney, chief executive officer,Redox. “As a leader in the LTPAC space, PointClickCare is in a unique position to help redefine the transition from acute to post-acute care by ensuring the data is not only effectively exchanged, but also harnessed to deliver vast improvements including facility matching and regional population health efforts.”
“Harmony by PointClickCare will allow for more specific and robust conversations between skilled nursing providers and their acute care partners,” says Kim Majic, chief development officer, Carespring Healthcare Management. “The solution is remarkable in its ability to capture the insights that hospitals want and succinctly display the metrics and goals that skilled nursing providers need to meet. I believe it can improve data exchange, inspire communication, and bridge the gap between care partners.”
"Having the right data at the right time is the foundation for effective decision-making, especially when a person’s healthcare is concerned," says B.J. Boyle, vice president and general manager of post-acute insights, PointClickCare. "Harmony by PointClickCare is designed to liberate the data and make it easy for healthcare providers to securely get the information they need when they need it to facilitate improved care coordination."

Money that Buys Good Health is Never Ill Spent
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average person covered by Medicare has out-of-pocket medical expenses in excess of $5,500 a year. Premium costs accounted for 28% of the total, while long-term facility costs, medical supplies, prescription drugs, and dental care claim the rest.¹
With healthcare expenses in the spotlight, it’s incumbent upon us to make sure our retirement strategy anticipates these costs.
But that’s not enough.
Remember, healthcare coverage (including Medicare) typically does not cover extended medical care. And it’s a prospect we shouldn’t overlook.
The Department of Health & Human Services estimates that about 70% of people will need extended care at some point in their lives.²
These annual costs can range widely based on geographic location, from over $63,000 in Oklahoma to nearly $300,000 in Alaska.³ When workers were surveyed, only 16% said they were “very confident” they would have enough money to pay for long-term care in retirement.⁴
Finally, you may want to consider a Medigap policy, which may help cover some of the healthcare costs not covered by Medicare.
Making sure that you are properly insured for your medical costs may help strengthen the foundation of your retirement.

I brought an associate that needed a post accident drug screen. We waited over 30 minutes in the lab until someone showed up. Then the nurse told us that she had to do some draws and she would be back in a few minutes. We now have been here an hour. This is unacceptable.

Why Trump’s Antitrust Pick Is Great News for Pesticide Companies
Makan Delrahim will likely look favorably on the Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-DuPont megamergers.

The Trump administration appears ready to bless a pair of megamergers that will dramatically reshape the markets for seeds and pesticides. First, before he even took office, the president met with the CEOs of German chemical giant Bayer and US seed titan Monsanto, and boasted of the flimsy jobs plan they promised if their proposed merger goes through. Trump has also had chummy relations with chemical giant Dow, in the middle of its pending merger with erstwhile rival DuPont. This week, Trump announced his choice to lead the Department of Justice’s antitrust division: a lawyer/lobbyist who, for nearly three decades, has been shuffling through the revolving door between large corporations and the government agencies that shape and execute merger policy.
“I’m willing to take my chances with The Donald,” Delrahim declared, citing the death of right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and the need for a like-minded replacement.
Makan Delrahim now serves as deputy counsel to Trump, helping shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch through the Senate. He moved to the White House from his perch as a partner at lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. There, his recent clients include pharma giant Pfizer, the tobacco and real estate conglomerate Vector group, and casino player Caesars Entertainment. As International Business Times‘ David Sirota reported last week, Delrahim also recently lobbied on behalf of heath insurer Anthem as the company beseeched the Justice Department to approve its now-stalled proposal to merge with erstwhile rival Cigna. (If he’s confirmed, Delrahim will lead the very office he lobbied on retainer for Anthem—though he’ll likely have to recuse himself from any decision involving Anthem.)
Before his stint as a lobbyist, Delrahim served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Antitrust Division under President George W. Bush in the early 2000s, and on Bush’s Antitrust Modernization Commission until 2007.
Delrahim is by all accounts a devoted conservative who jumped on the Trump train relatively early. In a March 2016 op-ed for the New York Post, he noted that Trump was not his first choice for president, but urged voters to “coalesce” around Trump as he began to dominate the Republican primaries. “I’m willing to take my chances with The Donald,” he declared, citing the death of right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and the need for a like-minded replacement.
Like Scalia, Delrahim is widely viewed as friendly to mergers. In a memorandum to clients, the corporate law firm Davis Polk characterized him as “in line with previous Republican-appointed” DOJ antitrust enforcers, hewing to a “pragmatic, economically based approach to antitrust enforcement,” wary of “over-zealous enforcers and courts,” and attuned to the “need to promote and preserve efficiency-maximizing collaborations” among corporations. Such views mark a “significant shift from the view expressed” by President Barack Obama’s antitrust enforcers, who, the law firm noted, expressed skepticism about “proclaimed benefits and efficiencies” of mergers.
Over the next several months, the Trump DOJ will have to vet a slew of proposed corporate megamergers, including two that involve the agribusiness space: the planned marriage of two US chemical behemoths, and the German chemical giant Bayer’s takeover of US seed titan Monsanto.
Between them, Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-DuPont would sell 75 percent of the corn seeds planted by US farmers and 64 percent of soybean seeds.
The ag deals Delrahim will be charged with vetting—Dow-DuPont and Bayer-Monsanto—have been shrouded in regulatory uncertainty since they were first announced, because they would lead to an extraordinary concentration in seeds, genetically modified traits, and pesticides. If the deals go through, three companies—Dow-DuPont, Bayer-Monsanto, plus Syngenta (itself recently taken over by a Chinese chemical conglomerate)—would sell about 59 percent of the entire globe’s seeds and 64 percent of its pesticides. Here in the United States, the consolidation would be even more severe. Bayer-Monsanto alone would own nearly 60 percent of the US cottonseed market; between them, Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-DuPont would sell 75 percent of the corn seeds planted by US farmers and 64 percent of soybean seeds.
As I noted here, these companies are all hotly marketing “precision agriculture” services, where they crunch data picked up from farmers’ field equipment and provide them with advice on what seed varieties to plant and pesticides to apply. Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant laid out the strategy in a conference call with investors a few months before the Bayer deal. Monsanto, he said, is pursuing an “integrated solution strategy” that creates a one-stop shop for “seeds, traits, chemistry, and data science tools to farmers around the world.” Dow, DuPont, and Syngenta have all rolled out their own, similarly closed-loop precision-ag arms. These arrangements give the tiny field of players even incentive to create, say, crop varieties that work only with one of their own proprietary pesticides.
One possibility is that the Department of Justice could approve the deals, on condition that the companies sell off overlapping business segments. The European Union recently signed off on the Dow-DuPont merger, after the companies agreed to what Bloomberg called “hefty concessions, including the sale of large parts of DuPont’s global pesticide business.” But such divestitures don’t automatically reduce consolidation. German chemical titan BASF, itself a large player in pesticides, has “expressed interest in snapping up some of the companies’ divested assets,” reports the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, if Bayer and Monsanto are forced to sell off some business lines to push their deal through, both BASF and Syngenta are ready to pounce on those juicy morsels, Bloomberg reports.
Also, such sell-offs don’t address the fact if the deals go through, what had been four R&D programs will be reduced to two, giving “short shrift to innovation competition,” says Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute. Moss argues that such hyperconsolidation limits farmers’ choices in the seed and chemical markets, driving up prices. Eventually, higher costs for these vital farm inputs will be passed on to consumers.
TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
The Mueller report might not say it, but David Corn will. So amid the swirling headlines and cable chatter, David provides a clear and honest assessment of what we really know about Trump's actions: “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia's Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”
Even though Mueller may be done with his investigation, Mother Jones is not. David and his team in Washington have been digging deep on the Russian connections and other corruption scandals since before the 2016 election, and we're not stopping now.

This is arcane, but I guess I need to follow up on my post last night about the CBO’s report on extending tax cuts. I think I’ve figured out what’s going on.
The CBO chart is below, and it doesn’t seem to match the data in Table 4. But it does, sort of. Take the bar for full extension of tax cuts with a weak labor response. According to Table 4, its effect in 2020 is to reduce real GNP by 1.6%. That’s if everyone assumes there’s no response. But if we assume that government spending will be reduced after 2020, a lifecycle model predicts that the net effect of extension is only -1.4%. If we assume a tax increase after 2020, the lifecycle model predicts that the net effect is -0.8%.
Now average all those together and you get -1.26%. That rounds to -1.3%, and that’s what’s shown in the chart. If you average all the other options they also match the chart.
Is this simple arithmetic averaging legit? Beats me. And I’m not even sure who to ask. But apparently that’s what they did.
One more thing, though. The CBO model suggests that in all cases, a policy response to full extension of the tax cuts reduces the long-term damage. However, a policy response to extension of just the middle-class cuts increases the long-term damage or has only a tiny effect. This seems like a very strange result. Why does a policy response (either lower spending or higher taxes) have a strongly positive effect in one case and a bad or negligible effect in the other? Again, I’m not even sure who to ask. But it seems odd even if you’re a supply side die hard.
TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
The Mueller report might not say it, but David Corn will. So amid the swirling headlines and cable chatter, David provides a clear and honest assessment of what we really know about Trump's actions: “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia's Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”

GIRLS BASKETBALL: No. 10 Cromwell knocks off No. 2 Bacon, 53-50
Jimmy Zanor
Published 12:00 am EST, Sunday, January 6, 2013
After winning three games in four days, Cromwell girls basketball coach Kelly Maher has decided to give her team a day off tomorrow.
To say that the Panthers day of rest is well-deserved would be a great understatement.
Powered by the shooting of senior guard Alexa Riley and another gutsy double-double from junior forward Janelle Harrison, who played on a sore ankle, Cromwell rallied for a thrilling 53-50 victory against second-ranked Bacon Academy Saturday afternoon in Colchester.
"We were mentally tough today," said Maher. "They were the defending Class L champs and the kids wanted to see what they were made of. They were ready to go."
The Panthers not only snapped the Bobcats' 43-game home-court winning streak, but it may be the first time in Connecticut girls basketball history that a team defeated defending state champions on consecutive days. Cromwell had topped Class S champs Coginchaug, 45-30, the night before. Bacon Academy, which also played on Friday night (a 52-22 win against Woodstock Academy), defeated E.O. Smith in the Class L championship game last March.
"This was a huge weekend for us," Maher added.
The matchup of Top 10 teams - Cromwell was ranked No. 10 and will most likely move up when the new Register Top 10 poll is released on Sunday - was a battle from the outset.
Behind the play of senior forward Tara McLaughlin, who poured in a game-high 26 points, and senior guard Carlee Putnam (nine points), the Bobcats built a 9-point advantage in the second quarter.
"We could have folded there," said Maher. "We could have crumbled. But we cut into their lead and that was huge."
Bacon Academy (6-1) still maintained a 26-23 halftime lead and a 42-38 cushion after three quarters.
But the fourth quarter belonged to Cromwell. And Riley.
Riley scored 10 of her team-high 15 points in the final 8 minutes. The 5-foot-6 guard drained a pair of 3-pointers, including one trey that gave Cromwell the lead for good, and also made 4-of-4 free throws down the stretch.
"(Riley) felt it and wanted the ball," said Maher.
Harrison finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds, while senior forward Kelly Flanigan scored 14 points and dished out four assists as Cromwell remained unbeaten at 10-0.
"We played really well as a team today," added Maher, now in her sixth season at the helm. "We moved the ball and just played together. We also played great team defense. This was a battle and was played in a great atmosphere. The kids were ecstatic with this win."

U.S. Citizenship Derived or Acquired from Parents if Born Abroad
﻿If you meet certain criteria, you can become a U.S. citizen at birth or later in life.﻿
To become a citizen when you are born, you must:
Have been born in the United States, or certain U.S. territories or outlying possessions,; OR had a parent or parents who were citizens at the time of your birth (if you were born abroad) and meet other requirements.
Citizenship Through Parents
There are two ways to obtain citizenship from your parents, one is at birth and one after birth but before the age of 18.
Citizenship at Birth for Children Born Outside the U.S. and its Territories
A Child Born Outside the U.S. is a Citizen at Birth IF:
Both parents were U.S. citizens at the time of birth, AND
The parents were married at the time of birth and at least one parent lived in the U.S. or its territories prior to the birth.
A Child Born Outside the U.S. is also a Citizen at Birth IF:
One parent is a U.S. citizen at the time of birth and the birthdate is on or after November 14, 1986, AND
The parents are married at the time of birth and the U.S. citizen parent had been physically present in the U.S. or its territories for a period of at least five years at some time in his or her life prior to the birth, of which at least two years were after his or her 14th birthday.
Spending time abroad as U.S Citizen parent in any of the following three capacities can also be counted towards the physical presence requirement:
(1)U.S. Armed Forces;
(2)Employed with U.S. Government; or
(3) Employed with certain international organizations.
(4) time spent abroad by the U.S. citizen parent while the U.S. citizen parent was the unmarried son or daughter and a member of the household of a person who meets any of the three conditions listed above can also be counted.
A Child Born Outside the U.S. is also a Citizen at Birth IF:
One parent is a U.S. citizen at the time of birth and the birthdate is before November 14, 1986 but after October 10, 1952, AND
The parents are married at the time of birth and the U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the U.S. or its territories for a period of at least ten years at some time in his or her life prior to the birth, at least five of which were after his or her 14th birthday.
Spending time abroad as U.S Citizen parent in any of the following three capacities can also be counted towards the physical presence requirement:
(1)U.S. Armed Forces;
(2)Employed with U.S. Government; or
(3) Employed with certain international organizations.
(4) time spent abroad by the U.S. citizen parent while the U.S. citizen parent was the unmarried son or daughter and a member of the household of a person who meets any of the three conditions listed above can also be counted.
Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America
A child born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent or parents, the child’s parents should contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to apply for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America (CRBA) to document that the child is a U.S. citizen. If the U.S. embassy or consulate determines that the child acquired U.S. citizenship at birth, a consular officer will approve the CRBA application and the Department of State will issue a CRBA, also called a Form FS-240, in the child’s name.
According to U.S. law, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. citizen (CRBA) is proof of U.S. citizenship and may be used to obtain a U.S. passport and register for school, among other purposes.
The child’s parents may choose to apply for a U.S. passport for the child at the same time that they apply for a CRBA. Like a CRBA, a full validity, unexpired U.S. passport is proof of U.S. citizenship.
A Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. citizen is only issued to a child who acquired U.S. citizenship at birth and who is generally under the age of 18 at the time of the application.
The U.S. embassy or consulate will provide one original copy of an eligible child’s Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. Citizen.
You may replace, amend or request multiple copies of a Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. Citizen at any time.
Consular Report of Birth Abroad NOT Required if you were born in U.S. Territory.
Persons who acquired U.S. citizenship or U.S. nationality at birth in one of the following current or former territories or outlying possessions of the United States during relevant time periods are not eligible for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. Citizen because such persons are not considered to have been born abroad.
Individuals born in these locations during the relevant times may establish acquisition of U.S. citizenship or non-citizen nationality, based upon the applicable agreement or statute, by producing their birth certificate issued from the local Vital Records Office along with any other evidence required to establish acquisition:
Puerto Rico
U.S. Virgin Islands American Samoa
Guam
Swains Island
The Panama Canal Zone before October 1, 1979
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands after November 3, 1986
The Philippines before July 4, 1946
Other Citizenship Documents Issued to U.S. Citizens Born Abroad.
Issuance Certification of Report of Birth (DS-1350)
As of December 31, 2010, U.S. Embassies and Consulates no longer issue Certificate of Report of Birth of a U.S Citizen. It is now issued centrally from the United States. A more secure Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. Citizen was introduced in January 2011 but the birth must still be reported to U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
Certificate of Citizenship issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)
A person born abroad who acquired U.S. citizenship at birth but who is over the age of 18 (and so not eligible for a CRBA) may wish to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship to document acquisition using form N-600.
Automatic U.S. Citizenship After Birth - But Before the Age of 18
A Child Born Outside the U.S. is a Citizen after Birth IF:
The child was under 18 or not yet born on February 27, 2001, AND
At least one parent is a U.S. citizen, the child is currently under 18 and residing in the U.S. in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent pursuant to lawful admission for permanent residence.
A Child Born Outside the U.S. is also a Citizen after Birth IF:
The child was under 18 from December 24, 1952 to February 26, 2001, AND
The child was residing as a Green Card holder in the U.S. and both parents naturalized before the child’s 18th birthday; OR
If one parent died, that the surviving parent naturalized before the child turned 18.
OR
If the parents legally separated, that the parent maintaining legal and physical custody naturalized before the child turned 18.
OR
If the child was born out of wedlock and paternity has not been established by legitimation, the mother naturalized before the child turned 18.

The adoptive parent adopted the child before his or her 16th birthday (or, in some cases, 18th birthday) and had legal custody of the child and resided with the child for at least two years; OR
The child was admitted to the United States as an orphan (IR-3) or Convention adoptee (IH-3) whose adoption by his or her U.S. citizen parent(s) was fully completed abroad; OR
The child was admitted to the United States as an orphan (IR-4) or Convention adoptee (IH-4) who was coming to the United States to be adopted and the child's adoptive parent(s) completed the adoption before his or her 18th birthday.

#YouthVote: Democracy in our backyard
Giving a damn

#YouthVote: Democracy in our backyard
By Nikkola Mikocki-Bleeker and Isabel Stewart
Outgoing and Incoming International Engagement Communications Coordinator
When Donald Trump was elected US President in January, left-wing social media exploded into anger, fear and sadness. For disadvantaged minorities, Trump’s victory was life-threatening. The ecological futures of young people were endangered, and racialised vitriol was suddenly legitimised against people of colour, those with migrant backgrounds, and Muslims. Those who express gender and sexuality outside the norm and many others faced the prospect of an increasingly unwelcoming home.
“As young people who care about democracy and human rights, isn’t it our responsibility to give a damn about what’s going on in our backyard?”
It was unsurprising, then, to see Australian allies erupt into a clamour of protest. But even my own lobbying made me wonder about US cultural and political supremacy. I saw how little I and those like me - considering ourselves informed and compassionate - knew about democracy closer to home.
The Asia-Pacific region is the area where Oaktree focuses its work: funding education programs and partnering with like-minded youth organisations. 2017 has also seen, or will see, three countries in which Oaktree has partners (Timor-Leste, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea) undergo political elections. Outcomes of these elections will have their own far-reaching effects in these societies and across the region.
As young people who care about democracy and human rights, isn’t it our responsibility to give a damn about what’s going on in our own backyard? I asked Oaktree’s expert country teams*** what - at the very least -should we know and care about?
Timor-Leste
Who won in March 2017?
In Timorese presidential elections in March of this year, Francisco “Lu-Olo” Gutteres of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN) party, won with 57.1% of the vote. Lu-Olo has strong backing from key Timorese resistance heroes (a complex issue in the relatively new nation).
Why is this significant?
Lu-Olo is one of the older members of the independence resistance movement from 1975-1999, and has the backing of Xanana Gusmao (a significant resistance hero, considered the father of modern Timor-Leste). As Oaktree has touched on before, members of the resistance fight remain popular in politics, leaving little space for younger leaders. This is a problem as nearly 50% of the population is under 18.
What should we be concerned about?
Politically disengaged voters relying on an old guard of revolutionary heroes could mean that elitism will predominate in Timorese politics. Maintaining this status quo could mean younger leaders will not be represented in power. Further, persistent economic uncertainty, unemployment and issues with secondary education must be addressed. Significantly, these are issues that will affect the Timorese youth bulge most of all.
What about the parliamentary elections next month?
The results of the presidential elections do not show much promise for a generational change of political power from the older generation of leaders to the younger generation. For this reason, the upcoming parliamentary elections will be key. Time will tell whether youth and issues affecting them will be represented.
Cambodia
Who will win the elections in June 2017?
For the past 32 years, the Cambodian Communist Party (CCP) have ruled Cambodia. In June this year, the Party, as led by controversial leader Hun Sen, looks set to win the commune elections with about 71% of the vote.
What is significant about this probable result?
Though Cambodia’s democracy has long been beleaguered, the recent election showed promise for its future with an 85% turnout for voting. Cambodia’s current median age is 24, a significant factor in the electoral outcomes as Cambodia’s youth are proving to be more engaged and informed than previous generations.
What are possible dangers?
Hun Sen and the CCP continue to use fear as a method of retaining power in the country. In the past, Hun Sen has threatened civil war if the CCP were to lose elections and has recently been quoted as saying that political opponents should prepare their coffins.
PNG elections
What’s the history of elections in Papua New Guinea?
The 2012 victory of Prime Minister Peter O’Neill seemed to promise a transition from a problematic old guard to newer flagship policies of anti-corruption, free health and education, and infrastructural development.
What should we be concerned about leading up to these elections?
Free schooling (while well-intentioned) has meant greater education access but with issues such as overcrowded classrooms. It has also been just over one year since PNG police shot at university students who were protesting government corruption (ironically with a specific focus on Prime Minister Peter O’Neill). To this day, the students await justice. Compounding these issues, 50% of PNG’s population is under 20. We will look towards the nation’s upcoming elections (beginning on the 24th of June) to see whether this huge youth bulge and its interests will be represented.
There are many reasons we should care about democracy within our region and worldwide. Trump and those like him are scary because of what they represent, but together we can fight worldwide bigotry, fascism and divisive politics. So expect to hear much more from Oaktree and our partners over the next little while as we continue amplifying calls for democracy within our region. Just watch this space, as we wait to see how #YouthVote to change Asia-Pacific’s political future…
*** Thanks are owed to Lachlan McPhee (Pacific Programs Director), Kate Walker (Cambodia Partnership Manager) and Benjamin Sullivan (Southeast Asia Research Officer) for their guidance in writing this blog.

OAKLAND – In a time of sluggishness and inefficiency, the Warriors jumpstarted their engine by returning to a remedy that often camouflaged last season’s inconsistency.
The Warriors finished with a 117-101 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies because of a third-quarter blitz. After struggling against the Grizzlies’ grinding and slow-tempo style, the Warriors quickly went into overdrive. The Warriors turned a 58-58 halftime tie into a 92-73 cushion entering the fourth quarter en route to an eighth consecutive win and a tie for a league-best 10-1 record.
The Warriors scored 14 unanswered points over two minutes late in the third quarter. The run began with Alfonzo McKinnie’s pull-up jumper and ended with McKinnie’s 23-footer. In between, Stephen Curry sank a 27-foot 3-pointer, Kevin Durant made two jump shots and Kevon Looney converted on a layup. Meanwhile, Memphis (5-3) finished with a season-low 15 points in the quarter on 5-of-19 shooting from the field.
The Warriors anticipated playing a grind-it-out game against a Grizzlies team that entered Monday ranked 27th in total offense (104.3 points per game) and relatively efficient in field-goal percentage (44.8 percent) and from the perimeter (ninth at a 37.7 percent clip). Meanwhile, Memphis ranks No. 2 in points allowed (100.3) and 16th in defensive field-goal percentage (46.3).
“We just had to stay the course. This whole team uses up the whole possession to find their best shot,” Durant said. “You have to respect it. We’re so used to getting the team shooting the ball with 15, 16 seconds left on the shot clock and we’re getting down and running. But they’re a smart basketball team. We know they can’t run with us so we’re going to slow the game down. We did a great job of matching their physicality, but also switching up our style of play.”

Warriors forward Draymond Green is dealing with an injury.
All of which helped the Warriors absorb some issues. The most notable: Green missed the entire second half with a right foot contusion. Afterward, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that his X-rays came back negative. Durant believed that Green feels “all right” after noting he did not sit out right away. Still Durant admitted he had not talked to Green afterward, and Kerr expressed uncertainty about Green’s availability for Thursday’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks.
“It didn’t make sense for him to go out there and play in the second half,” Kerr said. “He sort of tested it out. We decided to shut him down. We’ll see what happens.”
The Warriors also experienced some other challenges. Curry had 19 points, while shooting a rarely inefficient 6-of-17 from the field. The Warriors frontcourt in Damian Jones (five) and Jordan Bell (four) became hobbled with foul trouble.
The Warriors compensated elsewhere. Klay Thompson had a team-leading 27 points while shooting 11 of 21 from the field and 3 of 7 from 3-point range. Durant added 22 points on a 7-of-11 clip and an 8-of-8 mark from the free-throw line. And the Warriors dominated in the third period.
“KD got through his spots and was doing everything out there,” Thompson said. “When he’s getting that mid range, he’s literally impossible to stop.”
(Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group)
Durant increased his playmaking duties.
It also became impossible to stop Durant and Thompson after assuming larger playmaking roles. With Green’s second-half absence, the Warriors relied on a drive-and-kick game to speed up the tempo. That became more effective than in the first half when the Warriors committed seven turnovers.
“I just tried to provide that same punch for us and facilitate the ball and also be aggressive to score, too,” Durant said. “I just tried to find the right play and make the right play.”
Those right plays also happened on defense. The Warriors held the Grizzlies to a 5-of-19 clip from the field and 1-of-5 mark from 3-point range. Memphis center Marc Gasol had zero shot attempts in the second half after only having two in the first half. The Warriors then ended the third period with Durant and Curry stopping Wayne Seldon at the rim.
After stuffing Seldon, Curry walked toward his teammates that had just cleared the bench. It was as if Curry took over for Green’s absence. Or as Durant joked, “We’ll have to start calling him a rim protector now.”
“That was impressive. I was hoping for the Mutombo finger wag,” Kerr joked. “I didn’t quite get it.”
(Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group)
The Warriors are relying on McKinnie in crunch time.
As McKinnie strolled into the press conference room, a reporter jokingly lamented his arrival and wondered if he has become bored.
“I can become used to this,” McKinnie said grinning.
For two consecutive games, McKinnie has commanded the podium for obvious reasons. He offered another promising performance for a player who joined the Warriors as a training camp invitee (14 points on 6-of-9 shooting, 2-of-3 from 3-point range in 19 minutes off the bench). He provided a pivotal part of the Warriors’ third-quarter run. He played the entire fourth quarter.
That has left the Warriors wondering if he is just getting started.
“Don’t wake him up,” Kerr joked. “What I love about him is he’s naturally very confident. He’s not afraid of anything. He gets out there and rises up. He’s open, he’s going to rise up and maybe that’s what his journey led to.”
That journey has become well documented in the past two weeks.
McKinnie went undrafted after playing at Eastern Illinois (2010-12) and Wisconsin-Green Bay (2013-15). He played internationally in Luxembourg and Mexico. He paid $175 for a 3-on-3 tryout with the Chicago Bulls’ G-League team, which then led to stints with Windy City (2016-17) and the Raptors 905 (2017-18). With Patrick McCaw’s free agency at a standstill, the Warriors turned McKinnie’s training-camp contract into a regular-season deal that becomes guaranteed on Jan. 10.
“He was an NBA player. But it’s all about getting your opportunity,” said Warriors guard Quinn Cook, who played in the G-League last season. “There’s so many talented guys who are in the league who just haven’t gotten their perfect opportunity. He’s taking full advantage of it. It says a lot about him.”
It also says a lot about McKinnie on how he has dealt with the attention.
He noted that his “phone’s been blowing up” and that his Twitter account has gained followers. McKinnie added, “I’m just happy I’m in this situation.” But the Warriors have not sensed the extra attention changing him.
“Zo is not reading too much into that because it’s not really real,” Durant said. “He tries to come out there and play extremely hard and is shooting the ball with confidence at the moment and playing defense. So he’s going to step outside of himself. I think we’re all excited for him. But we want more for him. He wants more for himself. It’s 11 games in. We look forward to seeing him do this the rest of the year.”
Will that be sustainable? Defenses are likely to key in on McKinnie. Maybe the heavy minutes eventually catch up to him. But his stock has kept rising. He has defended consistently because of his constant hustle. He has shot consistently because of his strong confidence.
“It’s unbelievable. I don’t what to jinx the man. But he makes his first shot every time he comes in the game,” Thompson said. “He’s so efficient and fills up such a great role for us with his defensive versatility and ability to rebound and ability to knock down jumpers. He took a crazy path and he deserves everything he’s doing. He works really hard.”
(Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group)
The Warriors appreciate Quinn Cook’s professionalism.
The moment could have caused Cook to complain publicly or sulk privately. After sitting on the bench during the Warriors’ wins last week against New Orleans and Minnesota, Cook channeled his frustration elsewhere. He completed a postgame shooting workout.
“For any basketball player, if their rhythm is off, they’ll try to do anything to get their rhythm back,” Cook said. “It’s something I’ve always done.”
Hence, Cook immediately felt comfortable returning to the lineup. He scored 13 points while shooting 4 of 5 from 3-point range along with seven rebounds in 13 minutes off the bench.
“He’s a true pro. He’s been working that hard since he was a kid,” said Durant, who grew up with Cook in the Washington, D.C., area. “I don’t think just because you get to the NBA. He puts in that work every single day.”
That work started at DeMatha High (of Hyattsville, Marylan) and Oak Hill Prep. It then continued at Duke University. During all of those stops, Cook said he often completed postgame shooting workouts after games he either shot the ball poorly or played limited minutes.
“You have to stay ready and always have to put the work in and stay in shape,” Cook said. “Just stay in tune with what’s going on. You never know when your opportunity will come.”
The Warriors pushed out the vote one more time.
Curry did not say much about the game at the postgame podium. When it came to the mid-term elections on Tuesday? Different story. Curry wore a black T-shirt with the words, “The Young People will win.” That phrase stemmed from the “March for Our Lives” group, founded by survivors of the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.
“Obviously understanding what tomorrow means in terms of how important it is to vote and specifically around candidates and people running for office that are protecting gun control and things like that,” Curry explained. “Trying to continue to raise awareness any way that I can. The saying speaks for itself as far as what tomorrow means all across our country.”
The Warriors have become outspoken leading up to Tuesday’s mid-term elections. They partnered with “Rock The Vote,” which resulted in registering seven players, two assistant coaches and a dozen staff members. In the past year, the Warriors have remained critical of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric. And Kerr has spoken out on every mass shooting.
“It was different how I was as a player,” Kerr said regarding his NBA career (1988-2003). “It wasn’t something that was talked about that much in professional sports. Some of that had to do with the fact we lived in a more stable time. We all had more faith in our government, what was happening and our institutions. When you’re more comfortable you’re less likely to be outspoken. Everybody is more uncomfortable now.”
And mostly everybody has a Twitter account.
“We live in an era of social media and everyone has a platform and every one has a voice. If you’re one of those guys in our locker room, we have a platform,” Kerr said. “They recognize they have the power to create some good and positive change. I’m really proud of them to urge people to vote. I’m trying to do the same thing. Hopefully it helps.”

Memphis’ Omri Casspi appreciates the Warriors’ gesture
The man did not play one postseason game for the Warriors. He also became hobbled with injuries. But the Warriors still honored Memphis forward Omri Casspi with a tribute video and a championship ring before Monday’s game.
“I’m really excited about it and really thankful,” said Casspi, who also was sidelined with right knee soreness. “It’s a class act by the Warriors. We all know how grateful I am for that.”
The Warriors waived Casspi before the NBA playoffs started for two reasons. He had missed the previous 10 games with a right ankle injury that showed no signs of healing. With Curry sidelined with a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee, the Warriors became encouraged with Cook’s emergence at point guard.
Though Casspi appeared tentative with taking 3-point shots, he still averaged 5.7 points on 58 percent shooting in 14 minutes. He also impressed the Warriors with his selfless play and effective cutting.
“I’m glad he’ll be able to be recognized,” Kerr said. “The circumstances last year were really tough. It’s part of the NBA.”

The Warriors are staying cautious with their veteran reserves.
Warriors veteran Shaun Livingston missed a fourth consecutive game because of a sore right knee that Kerr believes Livingston will heal by the end of the week. Meanwhile, veteran Andre Iguodala sat for what the team considered rest purposes after nursing a recent injury.
Iguodala’s absence extended his recovery period since the Warriors last played Friday against Minnesota. The Warriors do not play until Thursday against Milwaukee.

Learn about resources for extended care of a loved one
Whether the need happens suddenly or over a period of years, when the necessity for extended health care happens, knowing about community resources is a necessity. The worst case scenario is to have to make decisions about long term care in a crisis.
“Options for the Future: Living Choices for Older Adults & People with Disabilities” is presented every six months as a free, information-only opportunity to learn about the wide variety of services and resources in Pierce County. Topics to be addressed include in-home care, geriatric care management, elder law, adult family homes, assisted living, skilled nursing homes, memory care, Medicare, Medicaid and community resources in Pierce County.
“Life is fragile,” said Aaron Van Valkenburg, Pierce County Aging and Disability Resources manager. “For some people – even the youngest and healthiest individual – life can change in a blink with an accident or illness. For others, the gradual onset of disabilities may lead to need for extended care. In either case, knowing about community resources and how to tap into them is crucial.”
“Options for the Future” will be held from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. April 7 at the Jim and Carol Milgard Family HOPE Center, 8502 Skansie Avenue in Gig Harbor. The event is jointly sponsored by Pierce County Community Connections Aging & Disability Resources and the Health Care Providers Council of Pierce County.
Participants will have the chance to learn about services and resources and ask questions of local professionals in the long term care services network. The workshop is free and open to the public. For more information about the workshop itself, call the Pierce County Aging and Disability Resource Center at (253) 798-4600.

6 December: General Affairs Council
EU foreign ministers focused on preparations for this weekend’s summit of heads and state and government in Helsinki where key decisions will be taken on enlargement, European defence and security policy, and reform of the Union’s internal decision-making procedures.
European Voice
12/8/99, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 5:15 AM CET
ON enlargement, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen led a discussion on plans to expand the number of countries negotiating to join the Union by six to take in five more states from central and eastern Europe plus Malta. EU leaders will certainly invite Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania to start talks during the Portuguese presidency in the first half of next year. They are also expected to offer Bulgaria and Romania a seat at the negotiating table following the steps taken by both countries to meet pre-conditions set by the European Commission on nuclear safety, economic and child welfare issues.
MINISTERS did not settle the key issue of whether Turkey would be given full candidate status at Helsinki. A spokesman for the Finnish presidency said the decision would be taken by Union leaders themselves when they meet this weekend. Diplomats said after the foreign ministers' meeting that Sweden and the Netherlands had softened their opposition to giving Turkey full candidacy on human rights grounds. Some countries also commented positively that Ankara was showing signs of agreeing to refer disputes over islands in the Aegean to an international tribunal, which would increase chances of Turkey winning candidate status. However, officials said it was unclear whether EU leaders would agree to a Greek request for governments to pledge that Cyprus could join the Union whether or not the question of its status was resolved.
A FINNISH paper on next year's Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to reform the EU treaty to prepare for enlargement was also discussed briefly. Union leaders are expected to agree at Helsinki to confine the negotiations to a limited number of issues, including the size of the Commission, the reweighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the extension of qualified majority voting. EU governments may also tackle the question of the constitutional changes needed to allow new military decision-making bodies to function effectively and a new Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Ministers agreed in principle on a new EU security capability which would give the Union the capacity to use military and non-military means to tackle regional crises. They decided to set a target for an EU rapid-response force of up to 60,000 troops which could be deployed at 60 days notice and could stay on the ground for at least one year. But to reassure the US and NATO members that the new force would not be a rival to the western alliance, ministers confirmed that the Union would only launch and lead a military operation if NATO decided that it did not want to spearhead a campaign. They also agreed a range of new decision-making structures including a permanent political security committee to meet in Brussels, a military panel comprised of defence ministry officials and a military staff to provide expert advice.
FOREIGN ministers delivered their strongest condemnation yet of Moscow's military campaign in Chechnya after the Russian army warned civilians to flee the capital of Grozny or be killed. "The present campaign and the unacceptable threat to the people of Grozny can only perpetuate, not break, the cycle of violence in the northern Caucasus," they warned in a statement issued after the meeting. Ministers discussed a range of sanctions which could be imposed on Russia including withholding International Monetary Fund loans, halting deliveries of food aid and suspending an EU-Russian scientific project, but took no concrete decisions.

Waterville weighs restrictions on where sex offenders can reside
A teacher's request may lead to limits on how close registered offenders can live to places where children gather, such as schools, parks and playgrounds.

WATERVILLE — Andrew Ayers is frightened for his daughter when he looks out his window and sees a registered sex offender walking past Albert S. Hall School against his probation restrictions.
As a teacher, Ayers hears from female students about how frightened they are of sex offenders in their neighborhoods.
Albert S. Hall elementary students board a bus in Waterville. On Feb. 7, police received a report of a registered sex offender walking near the school and police arrested him on a probation violation charge because he was prohibited from being around the school. David Leaming/Morning Sentinel
Registered sex offenders
Sex offenders are registered on three tiers, Tier 1 (10 years), Tier 2 (25 years) and Tier 3 (lifetime). The Maine Sex Offender registry determines in which tier a sex offender should be registered based on the severity and class of their crime or crimes. The registry is updated daily. The towns listed, with the exception of Skowhegan and Waterville, have enacted ordinances barring sex offenders from being within 750 feet of schools, parks, and areas frequented by children. Skowhegan will vote on such an ordinance at Town Meeting in June, and Waterville is in talks to create such an ordinance.

When he checked the law regarding sex offenders, he learned that Waterville could adopt an ordinance prohibiting some sex offenders from being within 750 feet of places frequented by children such as schools, parks and playgrounds.
On Feb. 6, Ayers stood before the City Council and urged councilors to consider developing such an ordinance.
“I don’t think this would be an administrative burden on the city,” he said.
He told the council that other municipalities, including Biddeford and Falmouth, have enacted ordinances, and he thinks it shows that residents want such restrictions. He said he understands there are arguments against it, including one that says 93 percent of victims of sex crimes know their perpetrators.
“But I would say, what about the other 7 percent?” he said.
Mayor Nick Isgro backed Ayers’ recommendation to have an ordinance and thanked him for speaking up.
“I think it’s a good idea, by the way,” Isgro said. Enacting an ordinance would send a message that sex offenders are not wanted in the city, he said.
OFFENDER RESTRICTIONS LIMITED
Police Chief Joseph Massey said state law authorizes municipalities to adopt ordinances that restrict certain groups of sex offenders from living within 750 feet of places such as schools, parks and municipal pools, if they have been convicted of a Class A, B or C sex offense against someone who has not reached the age of 14 at the time of the offense.
“It’s not all sex offenders,” he said. “If the crime is against a 16-year-old, restrictions don’t apply, so they could live within 750 feet.”
Also, sex offenders living within 750 feet of places frequented by children before an ordinance is enacted would not be affected, Massey said.
No one had proposed such an ordinance for Waterville before Ayers’ request to the City Council, Massey said. He said he has no issues with the idea of enacting an ordinance and he does not think it would place a burden on the police department.
City Manager Michael Roy said that, in his 13 years working for the city, he does not remember anyone specifically asking that an ordinance be enacted.
“We have had people suggest that we adopt restrictions, but those suggestions were never able to be supported by law – meaning that they wouldn’t pass constitutional muster,” Roy said.
Not everyone views an ordinance as necessarily the best course.
Rachel Healy, director of communications and public education for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, based in Portland, said the organization is not familiar with Waterville’s efforts to consider enacting an ordinance but she spoke about such ordinances in general.
“Generally speaking, while well-intentioned, restrictions on where former offenders can live aren’t based on data and don’t make anyone safer,” she said. “Instead, they drive former offenders into the shadows and further away from their support systems. They also ignore the fact that most offenses are committed by family members or acquaintances of the victims, not strangers. A better way to keep our kids safe is to focus on getting former offenders the rehabilitative services they need.”
AUGUSTA ALREADY HAS ORDINANCE
There are 46 registered sex offenders in Waterville, according to Massey, who said they live in various parts of the city. Some are on probation and may have specific restrictions because of that, he said.
In the city of 15,700 residents living within 13 square miles, there is one sex offender for every 341 people, or about 3.5 sex offenders in each square mile, Massey said.
When a sex offender moves into a neighborhood, police go door-to-door in that neighborhood to distribute fliers that notify residents of the sex offender, his address and his crime.
The city of Augusta has a sex offender ordinance, and the police department there has a website that lists the streets that a sex offender is prohibited from living on, he said. If Waterville were to enact an ordinance, police would advise newly registered sex offenders who committed crimes against people 14 and younger about areas they are prohibited from living in, Massey said.
Augusta Police Chief Robert Gregoire said in an email that Augusta enacted a sex offender ordinance in 2013 and that the request to adopt an ordinance came from the public.
Asked if sex offenders tend to re-offend, Massey said some have done so in Waterville over the years, but most violations are either that they do not register when they move to a new address, as required, or do not abide by probation restrictions, such as to not have contact with a child under the age of 15 or 16.
“We’re pretty familiar with many sex offenders, and I think we do a pretty good job recognizing them and knowing where they live and doing what we can to do additional oversight, given all the other challenges we face,” Massey said.
He noted that many sex offenders live in areas where resources are available, including courts, probation offices, mental health counseling and alcohol and drug counseling.
On Feb. 7, police received a report of a registered sex offender, Cory Kibbe, walking near Albert S. Hall School at the corner of Pleasant and School streets. Kibbe, who is prohibited from being near the school, was arrested on a probation violation, according to police records.
POSSIBLE COUNCIL VOTE NEXT MONTH
Ayers, the man who asked city councilors to consider adopting a sex offender ordinance, asked Councilor Nathaniel White, D-Ward 2, if he would sponsor such a proposed ordinance.
White said he would.
“I think Andrew has a very good point where we have a lot of schools in Waterville and we want to keep our kids safe,” White said recently.
“This ordinance should have been established in Waterville as soon as the state gave the towns and cities permission to enforce this,” White said. “With the revitalization of Waterville, I think this is important to establish within the city of Waterville. Of all the local neighborhood amenities that can influence the decision to purchase a home, good-quality schools is one of the most influential as parents are looking for a safe environment for their children. Establishing this ordinance in the city of Waterville will show that we as a city strive to create a safe environment for citizens to live and raise a family.”
Roy said Friday that the City Council will discuss a potential sex offender ordinance for Waterville on Tuesday and that officials will look at crafting an ordinance based on those enacted in other communities. No vote will be taken Tuesday, but it’s possible that councilors will take a first vote March 6 on a proposed ordinance, Roy said.
Ayers said he has taught in Waterville for 17 years, but lived in Vassalboro before he and his family moved to Waterville 1½ years ago.
“We are excited about revitalization and wanted to live downtown,” he said.
Recently, he noticed police fliers in his neighborhood notifying residents that a registered sex offender who had committed gross sexual assault against a child under 14 was living in the area right across from a school.
Ayers cited a list of municipalities that have enacted sex offender ordinances, including Bangor and Augusta, and said Waterville should do the same.

Fracking company to pay record fine for Clean Water Act violations
U.S. fracking company Chesapeake Energy has been hit with the largest civil penalty ever imposed for water contamination.

Staff — December 31, 2013
Jim Parkin/Hemera/Thinkstock	
U.S. fracking company Chesapeake Energy has been hit with the largest civil penalty ever imposed for water contamination. Its subsidiary, Chesapeake Appalachia LLC, has entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that states that the company will have to pay a $3.2 million fine for violating the Clean Water Act.
The EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Chesapeake Appalachia had discharged sand, dirt, rocks and other fill material into streams and wetlands without a federal permit. The discharge is estimated to have affected about 2.2 miles of stream and over three acres of wetland. The company will be required to spend approximately $6.5 million on restoring a total of 27 sites in West Virginia damaged by the illegal discharge. Of these, 16 sites involved fracking operations, the Department of Justice said in a statement. In addition, Chesapeake Appalachia will have to present the EPA with a comprehensive plan ensuring compliance with federal and state regulation on water protection.
RELATED: Fracking uses more water than thought, study claims
Robert G. Dreher, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, commented that by signing the agreement Chesapeake Appalachia was taking important steps to protect wetlands and water supply from contamination. The Environment and Natural Resources Division remains committed to ensuring that oil and gas development complies with the Clean Water Act and other federal laws, he added.

The following is a list of historical changes that were made to this asset. Typically, once an API is published on ProgrammableWeb.com, the data we keep about that asset gets updated over the course of its life. For example, the endpoint or home page of the documentation might change. As a means of enforcing the integrity of our data, every time a non-trivial change is made to the data we keep about an asset, we require the entry of some changelog text before that change can be saved. This way, we have a great audit trail of all activity surrounding the asset. For each asset, the changelogs begins with the moment an asset is approved for publication on ProgrammableWeb. If you spot an error in our data and believe that a record needs to be updated in some way, the ProgrammableWeb team would very much like to hear from you at support@programmableweb.com

How to Turn Existing Web Pages Into RESTful APIs With Import.io
API University import.io
Getting structured data out of web pages — often referred to as "web scraping" — is a real need, particularly for people whose job it is to prepare and analyze the information that's available in web pages. Meeting this need is right up the alley of a data extraction tool, such as Import.io.

Trump being Trump: Greatest hits from his press conference
Anne Flaherty, The Associated Press
Tuesday
Jun 12, 2018 at 8:57 PM Jun 12, 2018 at 9:38 PM
Some of the U.S. president's more noteworthy comments at the Capella Hotel in Singapore:
WASHINGTON — Not surprisingly, President Donald Trump's first official solo press conference in 16 months strayed from convention. He talked up North Korea's beachfront property as ideal for condo developments and declared the estimated 100,000 political prisoners in North Korea's gulag as the real winners of the U.S.-North Korea summit.
Here are some of Trump's more noteworthy comments at the Capella Hotel in Singapore:
I'M RIGHT, FOR NOW
Trump previously criticized President Barack Obama for looking weak after declaring a "red line" in Syria only to not follow through with a U.S. military strike.
On Tuesday, Trump avoided his own "red line" gaffe by attaching a surprisingly honest caveat to his insistence that North Korea will keep its verbal promise to destroy an engine testing site.
"I may be wrong," he said. "I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, 'Hey, I was wrong.' I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find some kind of an excuse."
I DIDN'T SAY KIM WAS NICE
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is suspected of ordering the public assassination of his half brother with a nerve agent, executing his uncle by firing squad and killing U.S. college student Otto Warmbier.
So why would Trump call him "very talented"? Because he is, Trump said.
"Well, he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it, and run it tough," is talented, Trump told reporters.
He added: "I don't say he was nice."
As for the estimated 80,000 to 120,000 people imprisoned in the North Korean gulag? Trump said the latest pomp and circumstance can only help them.
"I think, ultimately, they're going to be one of the great winners as a group," he said of the prisoners.
NORTH KOREA SAVED THE OLYMPICS
Some travel agents attributed lagging ticket sales for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Seoul to risks posed by North Korea.
To hear Trump tell it, Kim single handedly salvaged the Winter Olympics in South Korea when it agreed to send a delegation.
"As soon as North Korea agreed to send a delegation, tickets "sold like wildfire," Trump said.
"It was a great success," he said. "He did a great thing."
BEACH CONDOS
Trump gave control of his global real estate empire to his two adult sons after taking office, but never divested his businesses, opting instead to put his financial assets in a trust.
So the real estate mogul sounded as though he was looking for the next great opportunity when he lauded North Korea's "great beaches."
"You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right?" he asked. "I said, 'Boy, look at the view. Wouldn't that make a great condo behind?'"
Trump says he told Kim: "You know, instead of doing that (develop nuclear weapons), you could have the best hotels in the world right there."
TIME MAGAZINE COVER
Trump is known to boast about his appearances on the cover of Time magazine, and fake ones have been hung up at his golf courses. In a recent cover, an artist's rendering depicts Trump looking at a painting of him dressed as a king.
So when a Time reporter identifies himself, Trump responds: "Am I on the cover again this week? Boy ... (I have) so many covers."
The reporter says that is possible, but his question is whether Trump sees Kim as an "equal" considering the human rights abuse allegations.
Trump responds: "If I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honor to do it."

A Republican Senate?
Friday
Dec 30, 2011 at 12:01 AM
Ben Nelson is a rarity � a U.S. senator who sometimes votes with the other party. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have many of his kind, and their number will dwindle still further.
The Nebraska Democrat�s decision to retire from the Senate improves the Republicans� chances of gaining a majority in the chamber next year, and a shift in party control has a different meaning than it used to.
Arithmetic favors the GOP in 2012. Of the 33 Senate seats up for election, 23 are held by Democrats. Many of the 10 seats held by Republicans are in such deep-red states as Wyoming and Utah. The Democrats must defend seats in several states where their party is vulnerable � including Virginia, North Dakota and now Nebraska, where three incumbent Democratic senators have announced their retirements. Republicans would gain majority status in the Senate with a net gain of four seats.
Nelson is the only Democrat in Nebraska to hold statewide elective office. He has won two terms in the Senate, and two terms as governor before that, by being conservative enough to appeal to independent and even some Republican voters.
According to The National Journal, Nelson has been the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, voting with his caucus just 81 percent of the time, compared with Senate Democrats� average of 94 percent.
Nelson�s willingness to stray from the party line makes it difficult to fit him into an ideological pigeonhole. He opposes abortion, but favored repeal of the �don�t ask, don�t tell� policy for gays in the military. He delivered a crucial vote in favor of President Obama�s health care reform bill, but only after extracting a concession ensuring federal payment of Nebraska�s increased Medicaid expenses � the �cornhusker kickback.�
After his first term, Nelson�s relatively conservative record was good enough to win him the endorsement of Nebraska Right to Life and Americans for Tax Reform. No longer. In today�s hyperpartisan atmosphere, any member of the same party as President Obama is disqualified automatically by such groups. The number of Republicans who might expect support from liberal groups similarly has declined and might now be limited to Maine�s two senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, who occasionally break with their party colleagues.
The near disappearance of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans from the Senate raises the stakes in the competition for majority control. Not long ago, a minority in either party could count on a few senators from the other party crossing over to support its positions. A shift in party control left the power to influence legislation in the hands of a loose bipartisan coalition of centrists. That coalition has dwindled, and it will shrink still further in 2012.
But the ascendancy of caucuses made up of reliably ideological senators has not increased the majority�s legislative efficiency. In the Senate, a minority can use the filibuster to block the majority�s legislative agenda, as Republicans have shown throughout Obama�s presidency. If Democrats lose four or more seats next year, they�ll play the same role by standing in the way of the majority�s legislative steamroller. The days when a few senators might peel away to end a filibuster by members of their own party are gone � and gone, too, is the Senate�s ability to get much done.

30, 60, 90-Day Inpatient Vs. Outpatient Rehabilitation in Masonic Home, Kentucky	
Getting clean and sober from Lortab, Lorcet, alcohol or other drugs you or your loved one is addicted to takes an individualized treatment arrangement. Two options of addiction treatment programs in Masonic Home can help you succeed: either Inpatient or Out-patient Rehabilitation. Residential care offers continuing benefits with extended residence in a top rehabilitation facility. Outpatient treatments may be convenient, but lack the permanence and resources of three-month programs to become sober. Ultimately, the choice is your own, and we are here to help you choose the one that'll be best for you.
Maybe the best treatment for you...

Detaching yourself from the conditions of the addiction issue can help separate disruptions and temptations that prevent long-term recovery. When viewing rehab as a therapeutic refuge, addicts will find exclusive executive clinics in cities outside of Masonic Home, Kentucky. Offering resort-like amenities, the best-quality facilities help achieve a physical, psychological and emotional recovery. However, those looking for treatments from home may find a center close to your residence is a less difficult choice.

A co-occurring disorder refers to people who are simultaneously struggling with both a substance abuse problem and behavioral or mental issues. For instance, an addiction to cocaine, OxyContin, Norco or Oxycodone combined with compulsive shopping or compulsive gambling. For these people, a residential rehab center is often imperative, incorporating quality inpatient treatments with group support, such as one might experience in Narcotics Anonymous. Luxury drug rehabs in Masonic Home, Kentucky will provide excellent rehab services with upscale amenities for anyone requiring the very best drug rehab experience, just as Masonic Home alcohol rehab centers will help those battling alcohol to attain sobriety.
Note About Insurance for Addiction Treatment: Healthsmart, UnitedHealth Group and HMO Insurance frequently offer at least some coverage for your rehab stay, and you can find out more about your own carrier's policy or benefit status here.

Getting sober from MS Contin, Dilaudid, alcohol or other addictive substances you or your loved one is addicted to takes an specifically-tailored treatment strategy. Two options of drug or alcohol addiction treatment facilities in Sidney can help you succeed: either Residential or Outpatient Rehab. Residential therapy offers long-run gains with an extended stay in an excellent rehab clinic. From-home plans may be "easier", but lack the stability and assests of one-month programs to get into recovery. Ultimately, you make the choice, and we are here to help you pick the best fit.

Withdrawing yourself from the location of the drug or alcohol problem can help get rid of interruptions and temptations that prevent long-term sobriety. When viewing rehabilitation as a healing retreat, addicts will find luxury private centers in cities outside of Sidney, Kentucky. Offering resort-like qualities, excellent clinics help achieve a state of physical, mental and emotional healing. However, those looking for outpatient healing may find a program near your address is a less difficult decision to make.

Dual diagnosis refers to a person who is simultaneously coping with drug or alcohol abuse issues and behavioral or mental problems. For instance, an addiction to Suboxone, Norco or Adderall combined with video game addiction or bipolar disorder. For these cases, a residential treatment center becomes even more desirable, incorporating quality inpatient therapy with support group aid, such as one might see in Alcoholics Anonymous. Luxury drug rehabs in Sidney, Kentucky will provide the latest treatment with upscale amenities for anyone requiring the very best drug rehab, just as Sidney alcohol rehab centers will help those battling alcohol addiction to get sober.

European stocks close at five-month high amid trade and Brexit optimism
Josephine Mason
4 Min Read
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares closed at their highest level in five months on Friday as investors cheered positive signs on U.S.-China trade talks and UK lawmakers’ vote to request a delay in a potentially chaotic exit from the EU.
FILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, February 19, 2019. REUTERS/Staff
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.7 percent, its biggest gain in a month, and ended the day at its highest level since Oct. 4. All major bourses were in positive territory, led by Paris’s CAC 40, up 1 percent.
London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.6 percent, lifted by heavyweight oil and mining stocks that were boosted by higher metals and crude prices. Germany’s trade-sensitive DAX was up 0.85 percent.
Turnover picked up on Friday after being generally in line with long-term averages in recent sessions - STOXX 600 volume was almost double its 90-day average as investors rushed to position themselves ahead of another critical Brexit week.
The mood was boosted by growing expectations that Britain will not leave the European Union on March 29 without a deal to minimize economic disruption following Thursday night’s parliamentary votes.
London’s domestically focused midcap index rose 1.1 percent as sterling rallied in late trading.
Thursday night’s votes saw Prime Minister Theresa May’s government narrowly avert an attempt by lawmakers to seize the agenda next week if no Brexit deal has been passed, with the aim of forcing a discussion of alternative options before an EU summit on March 21. She plans to put her deal to the vote for a third time before then.
Investor confidence was also bolstered by news from China’s state news agency that Washington and Beijing were making further substantive progress on trade talks, and upbeat comments from U.S. President Donald Trump.
Gains may be a little overdone given the uncertainty about the outcome of next week’s Brexit votes, a slowing of economic growth and the fact that there has been little more than rhetoric around the U.S.-China trade talks, said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at asset manager Brooks MacDonald.
“There are still quite a lot of moving parts (to Brexit),” he said.
Still, technology stocks, which are particularly exposed to China, rallied 2.6 percent, their best day in five months.
They were also lifted by better-than-expected results from U.S. chipmaker and sector bellwether Broadcom, stirring hopes that the industry is recovering from the slowdown in Apple and smartphone demand that knocked earnings late last year.
STMicroelectronics topped the Milan bourse, Infineon jumped 3.9 percent and AMS rallied 7.1 percent.
Some of the individual movers were driven by legal dramas.
UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, was down 1.1 percent after saying it was bulking up its litigation provisions after a French court slapped it with a hefty penalty last month.
Wirecard sank almost 9 percent after Citi downgraded the German card payments company. The shares have plunged almost 40 percent since January.
The company rejected a report in the German business daily Handelsblatt, citing court documents, that authorities in Singapore were looking into Wirecard’s operations in India, acquired in 2015.
Norwegian salmon farmers SalMar fell 6.1 percent after a Berenberg downgrade.

Marc Maron interviewed President Obama for his 'WTF' podcast.	
Pete Souza/The White House	
In a widely discussed episode of comedian Marc Maron’s WTF podcast released Monday, President Obama discussed racism, gun control and what he considers his greatest achievements in office. Although there were lighter moments, such as when Obama ribbed Maron for being “a little narcissistic” for pasting photos of himself in his garage (where the interview took place) and joking about how his daughters find him boring, the president fielded more serious questions in a measured and often earnest fashion. Here are the ten most thought-provoking quotes the president said over the course of the hour-long interview.
Related: 5 Things We Learned From White House Correspondents’ Dinner
1. On the time Congress most “disgusted” him.
“Right after Sandy Hook, Newtown, when 20 six-year-olds are gunned down and Congress literally does nothing, that’s the closest I came to feeling disgusted. I was pretty disgusted.”
He added that “that’s the exception rather than the rule.”
2. On race relations in America (in which the president says the n-word).
“I always tell young people in America, ‘Do not say that nothing’s changed when it comes to race in America unless you lived through being a black man in the 1950s or Sixties or Seventies.’ It is incontrovertible that race relations have improved significantly during my lifetime and yours and that opportunities have opened up and that attitudes have changed. That is a fact. What is also true is that the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives, that casts a long shadow and that’s still part of our DNA that’s passed on. Racism, we are not cured of. And it’s not just a matter of it not being polite to say ‘nigger’ in public. That’s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It’s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don’t overnight completely erase everything that happened two to 300 years prior and so what I tried to describe in the Selma speech that I gave, commemorating the march there, again is a notion that progress is real and we have to take hope from that progress.”

3. On breaking the cycles of poverty and racism.
“What are we doing to help…lowest-income communities? We know, for example, that early childhood education works. That is one way to break the legacy of racism and poverty. If a 3-year-old, 4-year-old kid is in an environment of love and is getting a good meal and has a teacher that is trained in early childhood development and is hearing enough words and is being engaged enough, they can get to where a middle-class kid is pretty quickly….What hasn’t happened is us making a collective commitment to do it.”
4. On Charleston.
“During the course of my presidency, it feels as if a couple times a year I end up having to speak to the country, and to speak to a particular community about a devastating loss. And the grieving that the country feels is real – the sympathy, obviously, the prioritizing, comforting the families, all that’s important. But I think part of the point that I wanted to make was that it’s not enough just to feel bad.”
5. On our country’s gun laws.
“There are actions that could be taken to make events like this less likely. And one of those actions we could take would be to enhance some basic, common-sense gun safety laws that, by the way, a majority of gun owners support. This is unique to our country. There is no other advanced nation on earth that tolerates multiple shootings on a regular basis and considers it normal….The question is just, is there a way of accommodating that legitimate set of traditions with some common-sense stuff that prevents a 21-year-old who is angry about something or confused about something or is racist or is deranged from going into a gun store and suddenly is packing and can do enormous harm. And that is something that we have not ever fully come to terms with and unfortunately, the grip of the NRA on Congress is extremely strong. I don’t foresee any legislative action being taken in this Congress, and I don’t foresee any real action being taken until the American public feels a sufficient sense of urgency and they say to themselves, ‘This is not normal.'”
6. On the fight against terrorism.
“We ended two wars. But I always said from the start that there really are people out there who would have no compunction about just blowing up an entire neighborhood of Americans – innocent men, women and children – for ideological reasons. We have to deal with that. That then means that we do have to be able to identify those networks. We do have to, when we can find those folks, try to prevent them from doing what they’re doing. And so, for the last six-and-a-half years what I’ve tried to do is to build up a legal structure that is consistent with our values and due process, build up an intelligence system that is consistent with our civil liberties.”
7. On being, basically, America’s “middle management.”
“We’ve got to be mindful that whatever abstract views you have about drones or that you have about intelligence gathering that if you were sitting there in the Situation Room, you’d realize that you’ve got some responsibilities and you’ve got some choices to make. And it’s not all clear-cut the way oftentimes it gets presented. So I guess to go to the point…it’s like middle management. Sometimes your job is just to make stuff work.”
8. On whether we’re better off than we were four years ago.
“When I take an unemployment rate of 10 percent down to 5.5 percent, when I drive the uninsured rate to the lowest it’s ever been, when I restore people’s 401(k)s, when I make sure that we’re doubling clean energy, and we are reducing our carbon footprint, and high school graduations are the highest they’ve ever been, and college attendance is the highest it’s ever been, and LGBT rights have been recognized and solidified in ways that we couldn’t even imagine ten years ago – when I look at those things, I can say that in terms of not just managing the government, but moving the country forward, we’ve had a lot more hits than misses. We’ve made a difference in people’s lives. And that is ultimately what you’re looking for.”
9. On dealing with stress.
“I have learned not to worry about the day-to-day and to stay focused on what I need to do for the American people.”
10. On running for another term, if he could.
“I was talking to somebody the other day about why I actually think I’m a better president and would be a better candidate if I were running again than I ever have been. It’s sort of like an athlete. You might slow down a little bit, and you might not jump as high as you used to, but I know what I’m doing, and I’m fearless.”

Agriculture and Food Mycotoxins
If certain levels of mycotoxins (e.g. aflatoxin B1, deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin, ochratoxin, zearalenone, T-2 toxin) are present in animal feed, they can adversely affect the health of humans and animals.
SGS regularly performs mycotoxin testing to ensure feed safety and compliance with the strict regulations in place.
Mycotoxins range in their toxicity by type and end user. Our mycotoxin tests use either an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) or liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrophotometry (LC MSMS). These methods of mycotoxin analysis deliver appropriate levels of detection and quantification, ensuring that your feed matches the regulatory requirements for the levels of mycotoxins present.
Approved and accredited laboratories
To maintain our reputation for independence, integrity and innovation, our mycotoxin testing laboratories operate under strict guidelines and are accredited to ISO 17025 and ISO 9001:2008. Staffed by scientists and technicians with years of laboratory experience – as well as degrees in chemistry, microbiology and agronomy – our labs have also earned the approval of several feed associations.
Since we adhere to the highest industry standards, your feed is sure to satisfy national and international regulations for mycotoxin levels. Discover how we can help you, now.

Chemical Water System Validation
SGS is the leading provider of laboratory water testing and pharmaceutical water system validation services.
Purified water is a key component in the manufacturing of virtually all pharmaceutical products. Water purification systems must be validated to ensure that the specified quality of water is consistently produced.
If manufacturing plants are located near any of SGS’s Life Sciences Services laboratories, our technicians can perform the sampling for you. Alternatively, your staff can collect the samples and ship them to an SGS laboratory for analysis. We can supply containers for collecting water samples.
Your samples for microbiological testing will be put on test schedule the same day we receive them. Bacterial endotoxin and chemistry testing will be completed within five working days. Please contact your local laboratory from our network to discuss your purified water system validation requirements.
All water purification systems must be monitored regularly to verify the quality of the water produced. Water purification systems can potentially harbour high levels of bacteria and bacterial or chemical purity problems with water can compromise the quality of finished products. We can carry out the following water monographs on your behalf as part of our purified water system validation services:
Water Monograph Testing Performed According to USP/EP/JP:

Conductivity
Bacterial endotoxins (LAL)
Particulate matter
Total microbial count

FAQ
What is Probate?
Probate is the process by which the court validates the authenticity of a will; appoints an executor (aka personal representative); and supervises the settlement of an estate, including the payment of bills, filing of tax returns, and transfer of assets to beneficiaries. Every probate estate is unique, but most involve the filing of a petition with the proper probate court; sending notice to heirs and beneficiaries; Inventory and appraisal of estate assets by Personal Representative; Payment of estate debt to rightful creditors; Sale of estate assets; Payment of estate taxes, if applicable; and then final distribution of assets to proper beneficiaries. Many people choose to avoid probate by using a Trust as the focus of their estate plan.
What are Fiduciaries?
A very critical decision that you must make in the Estate Planning Process is choosing your Personal Representative, Trustee, Power of Attorney, Health Care Agent, and Guardian of your minor children. These people are called your Fiduciaries.
Why is it important to avoid Probate?
Probate is the court process that your family must go through in order to carry out the wishes outlined in your will. All assets with no beneficiary designation must go through probate. It can be expensive, take time to complete, and become public record. For these reasons, it is important to take measures to avoid probate.
How do I avoid Probate?
Only assets in your individual name or payable to your estate will go through probate. Many folks use a (fully funded) revocable living trust to avoid probate. In addition, contract assets such as life insurance, retirement accounts, and annuities as well as assets owned by joint tenants with rights of survivorship avoid probate as well.
A well designed and executed estate plan, including trusts and other strategies, can help you avoid probate.
Is Probate bad?
Many people, but not all, think so. The difficulty and expense of probate varies from family to family because of family goals and personalities, and assets. Many clients wish to avoid probate because it’s a public process, time consuming, and costly.
If I go through Probate, is my Will public information?
Most people want to avoid probate because it can include high fees and costs, significant time delays and stress, and public dissemination of private information. In most cases, court records are public records, meaning that anyone could get a copy of your will, the estate’s inventory, and other information you might wish to keep private. The ease of accessing this information does vary from state to state, and sometimes even from county to county. Some places even have online dockets, allowing anyone with an internet connection to see a listing of your assets, debts, beneficiaries, and who got what. If you’re like most people, you want to keep your family affairs and finances private, so probate should be avoided.
What does it mean if someone dies intestate?
Intestate means that a person has died without a last will & testament. Who is in charge of your estate, and who your assets are distributed to, are determined by statute and becomes a function of which relatives are alive at the time of your death. Typically, your property will pass to your closest relatives and family. Very often, the intestacy laws may apply in ways that do not reflect your intentions at all. In addition, there are many missed opportunities to plan for tax consequences, protect assets or establish guardianships for minor children. Intestacy is, in effect, a default estate plan created by the Commonwealth.
What is a Will?
A last will & testament is a legal document a person signs to document who they would like to inherit their estate. A Will also typically designates someone to be your Personal Representative, which is the person you designate to carry out your instructions. If you have minor children, a will is also where you would nominate their Guardian and Conservator. What is important to note is that wills have no legal authority until the Testator (person who created the Will) dies and the original will is delivered to the Probate Court and is “allowed” by the Court. A Will does not avoid Probate.
What is a Living Will?
Sometimes called an advance medical directive, a living will is a non-binding document that allows you to state your wishes in advance regarding what types of medical life support measures you prefer to have, or have withheld/withdrawn if you are in a terminal condition (without reasonable hope of recovery) and cannot express your wishes yourself. This document is typically executed in conjunction with a Health Care Proxy.
What is the benefit of a Trust?
Placing your assets in trust provides many benefits for you and your family. If you become incapacitated, your successor trustee can step in to manage your affairs. You also get greater power and flexibility over how your wealth is distributed to your beneficiaries. For example, you have the option of providing them with long-term protection against court control, divorce, bankruptcy, and financial mismanagement.
Can my Trust be updated?
If your trust is a revocable trust, as most are, you have the power to update it whenever you’d like (so long as you have the mental capacity to do so). Updates which add to, or replace, parts of an existing trust are called “amendments.” If the entire trust is updated, it’s called a “restatement.” In many cases, your attorney may recommend a restatement, so that the entire trust can be modernized, but for small changes an amendment can still be appropriate.
Technically, irrevocable trusts are indeed irrevocable and can’t be updated; however, trust protectors, judicial and nonjudicial modification laws, and decanting allow us to update an irrevocable trust that is no longer meeting the trust maker’s intent.
Since revocable trusts and, in some cases, irrevocable trusts, can be updated to take into account new laws, like the proposed tax changes we’ve all heard about, it’s always a “good” time to work on implementing an estate plan. Estate plans are designed to be flexible, so they can almost always be updated later to take into account future changes to the law.
What is a Revocable Trust?
A properly drafted revocable trust, sometimes called a living trust, is a powerful estate planning tool that allows you to remain in control of your assets during your lifetime, have your assets managed for your benefit during incapacity, and, upon your death, will allow for the efficient, private transfer of your assets to your beneficiaries according to your wishes. In addition to these basic functions, a revocable trust can also provide for estate tax savings, creditor protection for future beneficiaries after your death, and allow for management of assets for minor or disabled beneficiaries. All of this can be done outside of the probate system.
Will I lose any control over my property if I create a Revocable Trust?
Creating a revocable trust and transferring your assets to the name of that trust will not impact your ability to control such assets during your lifetime. The exception to this would be in the event of incapacity, then the successor Trustee would be in charge of the trust assets and would be responsible for managing the assets for your benefit in accordance with the terms of the trust. During your lifetime, you may engage in any transaction that you could before you had a Trust. There are no changes in your income taxes either. A revocable trust does not file any separate income tax returns. Because a living trust is revocable, it can be modified at any time or it can be completely revoked if you so desire. Upon your passing, the trust can no longer be modified and the successor trustee(s) you have designated will then proceed to follow the terms of the trust in accordance with your wishes.
Do I have to transfer any of my assets to my Revocable Trust?
Yes. For your trust to work and function as designed, assets must be placed into the trust. It is important, however, to seek the counsel of an experienced estate planning attorney who can advise on and assist with transferring the necessary assets to your trust. How assets are connected to a trust varies depending on the type of asset (i.e. real estate vs. life insurance vs. retirement accounts, etc). A well drafted estate plan must factor in the proper funding of the trust for the plan to work.
Do my kids have to know what I’ve decided to leave them in my estate plan?
From a technical standpoint, there is no requirement for the children to see or be involved with your estate plan. We do think that it is important that your family know you completed your estate planning. In the event of illness or death, it is important that they know you did your planning and who to contact. Also, in some situations, we offer and encourage families to have a family meeting to discuss estate plans and how things will work after your passing. Usually in those meetings we discuss the mechanics of how the plan will work, and do not typically disclose the specific bequests or amounts of those bequests. If, however, there is considerable wealth being passed along to another generation, we often suggest some counseling with professional wealth counselors to help families learn how to discuss these delicate issues.
How do I name a guardian for my children?
In Massachusetts, if you have children under the age of eighteen, you should designate a person or persons to be appointed guardian(s) over their person and conservator(s) over their property. Of course, if a surviving parent lives with the minor children (and has custody over them) he or she automatically continues to remain their sole guardian. This is true despite the fact that others may be named as the guardian in your estate planning documents. You should name at least one alternate guardian in case the primary guardian cannot serve or is not appointed by the court. You make these designations through language in your Last Will & Testament.
What is a HIPAA Authorization?
As part of your incapacity planning, you should sign a HIPAA authorization form that allows the release of medical information to your designated health care agents, successor trustees, family or any other individuals you wish to designate. Without this release form, medical providers can refuse to release information, even to spouses and adult children, due to the restrictions of the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
What is a Health Care Proxy?
Massachusetts law allows for a document called a health care proxy, in which you can appoint someone to make health care decisions for you should you be unable to make those decisions due to disability or incapacity.
What is a Durable Power of Attorney?
A durable power of attorney is a document that empowers another individual to carry on your financial affairs in the event you become disabled or incapacitated.
Without a Durable Power of Attorney, it may be necessary for one of your loved ones, including your spouse or adult child, to petition a court to be appointed conservator in order to make decisions for you when you are incapacitated. This conservatorship process is time consuming, expensive, often costing thousands of dollars and it can be emotionally draining for your family.
I am married. What happens if my spouse has to go to a nursing home?
For calendar year 2017 in Massachusetts, the spouse of a nursing home resident is allowed to keep $120,900.00 of countable assets. In addition, the nursing home resident is allowed to keep $2,000.00. Therefore, the total amount of countable assets that a married couple may keep is $122,900 in 2017. These numbers typically increase slightly each year. A married couple with assets under this amount is eligible for MassHealth without spending down assets. There are also stategies for a married couple with more than the allowed amount above in countable assets to still qualify for MassHealth in certain circumstances.
In addition, for a married couple, certain assets are considered “non-countable” in this assessment process, such as the primary residence, an automobile and an irrevocable prepaid funeral contract.

Stereophile: the Next Generation
Stereophile Staff | Mar 1, 2019
Today, Stereophile announces its first major Editorial changes in decades, with an expansion of the Editorial team and a change in leadership.
Since 1986, through many generations of corporate ownership, John Atkinson (right, above) has been the Editor and bedrock of the magazine. After nearly 331/3 years, JA has decided to relinquish daily responsibility for producing the magazine and as of April 1 will take on a new (and newly established) position: Technical Editor. Stepping into his shoes as Editor will be long-time Stereophile contributor Jim Austin (left, above). Deputy Editor Art Dudley will continue to do what he does best (and what he prefers to do): writing columns and reviews and editing the prose of Stereophile's other contributors, while managing an expanded suite of responsibilities. Richard Lehnert, who began his association with Stereophile in 1984 as our long-time Copy Editor and was the magazine's Music Editor 19871996, has also chosen this time to retire from the magazine that bears the stamp of his influence; Lehnert will be replaced by a new copyeditor, Linda Felaco. These changes will be effective as of the July issue of Stereophile.
"I'm deeply honored to become only the third Editor in Stereophile's distinguished history," says Austin, who has been writing for Stereophile for some 15 years. "It's a major responsibility to follow in the footsteps of audio legends like J. Gordon Holt and John Atkinson, and to hold the reins of the world's most important high-end audio magazine. It's an opportunity I relish, though. It's hard to even imagine a job I'd enjoy more."
As a teenager, Jim spent many hours at the Sound Shack, the audio boutique in his home town of Ft. Pierce, Florida. That's where he bought his first serious pair of loudspeakers, Polk Audio Model 7Bs, which he paired with a succession of Japanese receivers and Technics turntables. Later, he earned a PhD in physics and worked for a while as a research scientist, applying methods from nuclear physics to study of semiconductors and other materials. "It was nothing to do with music," Austin says, "but I was an experimental physicist and I learned a lot about electronics and craft." Still later he became an Editor at Science magazine, where he worked for 14 years, rising to the rank of Senior Editor while contributing to Stereophile on the side.
Despite the change in leadership, major editorial changes are not envisioned at the magazine. "Stereophile is a successful magazine," Jim says, "which is remarkable when you consider all the titles that folded or today exist only online. I intend to look for opportunities to make Stereophile better: more engaging, more relevant, more entertaining, with the best, most insightful writing about music and audio.
"My main objective, though, is to steer a steady courseto keep Stereophile pointed in the direction it has been pointed in for decades. In particular, Stereophile has always been a subjectivist audio journal. Its main concern has always been with how music sounds through the equipment we review and how it affects us, the listeners. But for 30 years Stereophile has been built upon the edifice of John Atkinson's measurements, which examine whether the components we review are thoughtfully and solidly engineered. Under my watch, we'll continue to do both those things, with, I hope, renewed vigor."
John Atkinson adds: At last fall's Rocky Mountain Audio Fest I asked a young Stereophile reader how he had discovered us. "I started reading my Dad's copy," he explained. "He used to read you in Hi-Fi News magazine in the 1980s."
I blanched. But yes, approaching 71 years old, I am long in the tooth. The June issue of Stereophile will be my 390th and though my hearing is still good, I decided it was time to hand the reins over to a new and, more importantly, a younger man.
As Jim noted, I will still be on Stereophile's masthead as Technical Editor. But having worked with Jim for the past 15 years, I know as Editor he will succeed in taking J. Gordon Holt's and my magazine to even greater heights. You have the conn, Jim.

I find this interesting. First, let me congratulate both men - JA, I was 9 years old when you took over and you arguably shaped many of my current beliefs about sound and many of my considerable spending decisions through the years; and JA2, whose conclusions I haven't always shared, but whose articles I have always read from beginning to end with interest. I've viewed JA's "quant" a welcome counter to the pages of "qual", which has always been Stereophile's yin to TAS's yang. In this regard JA2's appointment is a continuation of something that I have always regarded as a quality that made Stereophile the absolute best... "TAB". I have hired many people that I feel counter the norm, or my own personal beliefs, on the hope they'd create a diversity of thought that hedge the downside risk of groupthink and hivemind; in that regard I think this change ensures Stereophile's relevance for years to come, albeit with some turnover in staff given what I suspect is a strong personality. I say this in a positive sense. I don't know JA2, but my inference from his articles and comments is that he will kick the tires at every turn! Congratulations to both of you!

You're joking. The magazine has it already. It's called the measurements section of the review. Keep Stereophile exactly as it is. This is not Scientific American. It is art and magic and it cannot be explained with measurements or algorithms. If you can't accept that by now after 50 years of Stereophile and TAS, you're in the wrong hobby.

"Double Blind Tests" PROVE that all vodkas taste the same and that a Stradivarius is indistinguishable from a student violin. Actually those stupid results prove double blind tests though useful for many things are often not. And then as I found out when challenged to a double blind amplifier test that didn't go the way the test designer wished (to prove all amps that measure the same are sonically indistinguishable), excuses are made and "outlier" results (like when I got all identifications correct) get tossed.

Submitted by Anton on March 4, 2019 - 12:13pm
I love DBT (usually SBT and I get to play with the volume) but I know what you mean.
I have an acquaintance who did the "Brita" challenge at a science meeting neurology conference with a good vodka compared to cheap vodka that had been filtered through a Brita. There were six different Brita samples, corresponding to "one filtration," "two filtrations," etc.
He nailed the good vodka, the cheap vodka, and identified each filter sample by how many times it had been filtered.
Amazing.
Getting the test criteria straight would help with other DBT.
At some point, someone skilled enough should be able to rise above the terrible deafness caused by DBT and be able to tell things apart, like you did with the amps!
Also, what's true for an amp driving a complex thing like a speaker may not apply to other things, like fuses, "wires," etc. Still lots to flesh out!
I was just perusing the Hi Fi News site and they actually published measurements of wires, fascinating!
As a reader, I would love to see JCA (technical editor) compare and contrast an array of findings with these more subtle devices.
Both sides of the "makes a difference / no it doesn't" crowd need to find some room for common discussion.
Transparent measurements, listening trials, all part of the fun.
Our local club does blind comparisons and nobody gets butt hurt about challenging our listening skills.
In a recent club challenge, a plain over the counter fuse won the day vs. fuses costing up to 120 bucks per fuse! So, it seemed we had the ability to hear what was up, but the challenge was won by the little guy.
We did the same thing with passive preamps at a THE Show and a 400 dollar unit KILLED the 15,000 dollar and 2,000 dollar competition. (This was on a fancy system with King's Audio electrostats, etc.)
It's like when the 6 dollar bottle of wine beats the 120 dollar bottle, good for us!
I digress...instead of feeling threatened by DBT (actually, SBT and not instantaneous would be fine,) we should start the party and see how golden our ears really are.
Man, in the realm of measurements, how about comparing the differences between "broken in" and not for equipment, and see what may change!
Everyone is so afraid of being wrong, or having their perceptions "judged" that we poo poo a very fun thing!
In wine competitions, tasting is done blind and we get feedback on our perceptions, for better or worse. Hi Fi should be able to emulate that and see what happens.

Are the "useful" ones those with whose outcomes you agree and the "stupid" ones those with whose outcomes you disagree?
A given test doesn't prove that all vodkas taste the same.
It does demonstrate that a particular group of tasters could not reliably distinguish among the particular group of samples they tasted. If you're open-minded, you might consider conducting your own blind taste test to see if you reach the same conclusion, or not.
Likewise, outlier results shouldn't be tossed out of hand.
Rather, the test should be repeated to determine if those results can be confirmed.

I've been reading Stereophile since right before the digest to large format switch over and I have always loved it. Of course, back in those days, getting your CD player and a simple DAC figured out was a priority for me, anyway. By my calculations, that's right after your (JA) takeover, so I'm pretty accustomed to your editorial style. While I do miss the old cast of characters (J10, Corey, Sam and the late Mr. Reina), I'm sure with JA2 in the drivers seat, the course will stay true. Thanks for the great ride, so far.

You Could do Swiss Army Knives with Silver Inlayed Logos, Embroidered Hats, Silk Screened shirts and all manner of other desirable Desk Top trinket items.

I was referring to my Vinyl Business in the 1980s not You and your acquaintances.
The Audio Business continued, Redbook replaced 33.3, the Automotive Market bloomed into the Dominant Component of the 2 Channel Audio Industry with Billions of Dollars in Sales ( hidden in the New Car Window Sticker). The Movie Industry migrated from Magnetic Tape to 5.1 & 7.1 etc.
I attempt to be fair in saying it isn't 33.3 Vinyl's fault that it's number of proponents has tapered off to a very few committed & dedicated collectors.
Vinyl's largest problems are:
1). Prohibitively High Price of admission. ( New Playback Gear is Pricy )
and
2). Millennials ( the next generation of audiophiles ) are struggling with Tuition Debt as they complete their Diplomaed Education. They no longer have disposable income for Pricy Vinyl Audio gear in addition to the Digital Gear they are already able to access.
Vinyl's smaller problems include :
3). The amount of Support Gear needed
and
4). The Volume of Cubic Footage needed for the Record Storage Systems. ( what family is tolerant of the Vinyl Audiophile's 10,000 Record Collection.?)
So, you see, Vinyl has problems.
The Remaining 75,000 or so Vinyl playing people might be HighEnd Audio's smallest Minority, while Chad Kassem remains their Wonderful Higher Authority.
Where would Vinyl be without Chad breathing life into it?

What is your definition of ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:50pm
... "pricy" (or pricey) in regard to vinyl playback gear?
The first turntable and cartridge I bought (a few years before the introduction of CDs) would cost the equivalent of about $1,000 as adjusted for inflation.
At that price level, today, you can buy decent turntables from Audio-Technica, Pioneer, Pro-Ject and Rega, along with a moving-magnet cartridge from Audio-Technica, Nagaoka or Ortofon.
Or, for that same amount you could buy a complete system.
For example, an Audio-Technica AT-LP5 turntable (with cartridge included), plus a Yamaha R-N303 receiver (which also has a DAC and a network interface for streaming) and a pair of ELAC Debut 2.0 bookshelf speakers.
Such a system ought to be sufficient to tide over most millennials until they are able to afford something significantly more expensive.

Definition of Pricy:
Submitted by tonykaz on March 5, 2019 - 3:04pm
Vinyl playback is an extraordinarily pricy Hobby by comparison!
I'm talking HighEnd.
A VPI Avenger ( Comic Book Name? ) begins around $30,000! VPI is the finest turntable line I ever represented.
Arm price around $10,000
Phono Cart around $10,000 ( I'd think KOETSU )
Special Cables $ ?
Phono RIAA pre-amp $10,000 - up
A suitable stand for the Player $500 +
Vinyl record cleaning systems $ 500 +
Vinyl Record Storage Systems for 10,000 Records and the square footage to house them $100 per sq.ft. for 10 x 10 Room = $10,000
Buying Audiophile Vinyl $30/$50 each
A Vinyl System compared to a PS Audio DAC $5,000 playing Acoustic Sounds DSD downloads is far less expensive and far easier to maintain.
Committed Collectors, like the Vinyl Junkie, have lifetime collections to maintain.
New Millennials, starting fresh, may be vinyl curious but Digital presents a far wider mainstream Access to Glorious Music reproduction throughout 21st Century Life Environs.
There is a difference between Vinyl and the various Designers DACs: CHORD, PS Audio's Direct Stream, Schiit's Multibit, MSB's Analog DAC, etc. but the difference is small and the price differential is huge.
Price differential aside, Digital is an elegant solution to a complex problem.

It would coincide with analog's resurgence in recent years, while the use of a tiki torch by some MAGA-cap wearers is probably meant to symbolize "old school" technology.

They are extinct, but I have one of the originals from the mid-1990s, which I am wearing, and one of the newer ones from 10 years ago, which Jim is wearing.

But I don't hate the coffee mugs idea. Imagine this, John (and if this doesn't apply to you, John, would you be so kind as to forward my idea to the appropriate person in marketing): each Stereophile Limited Edition Collector's mug would be imprinted with, get this, the mug of someone at Stereophile!
A mug on a mug.
I see this type of thing all the time, with the Beatles, and other one-hit wonders.
The Montreal show is still three weeks away. There's still time if we hop to it!

Did Bogolu Haranath beat me to it on the "mug on a mug" idea? The posting times lead me to believe that he did.
In that case, do you mind if I borrow your idea, Bogolu? There's a free Stereophile Limited Edition Collector's mug in it for you.

It could be like those "Sex and the City" quizzes, except a person could get classified as a Herb Reichert, or Michael Fremer, etc..
Then, we could wear our corresponding T-Shirts and say things like, "Oh! That is such a Dudley thing to say."
"Oh, you strike me as a total Ken Micallef!"

How about t-shirts with a reviewer's face on it under which would be inscribed a witty two- or three-word catchphrase we might expect that reviewer to say.
Examples:
Michael Fremer's face with "Digital sucks!", or
John Atkinson's face with "Analyze this!"
And that's it folks! I've been silly long enough (spring fever baby!). Thank you all for your tips and ideas. Should anything come of them in a retail sense, I promise you all free merch (limit one item per person).

Thanks, Ortofan,
Submitted by rschryer on March 6, 2019 - 9:17am
I enjoyed that video. And I do believe what Paul is saying.
However, as far as my own experience is concerned, when it comes to mid-priced equipment — the category of equipment I can afford — rather than the megabuck stuff, I feel more inner peace and long term satisfaction listening to a vinyl setup than I do a digital one, regardless of whether the former may exhibit more measurable distortion than the latter.
As good as mid-priced digital can be, from what I've heard (and there's a lot out there I haven't heard, especially when it comes to the latest generation of DACs), I still hear a blueish-grayish tint of mechanical artificiality that overlays the music, an effect that keeps me from becoming completely engaged in the music.
The mid-priced LP setup has other problems, but I still find that it sounds more natural overall than does its digital counterpart.
As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)

mid-priced vinyl rigs do sound better than their megalomaniac counterparts due to inevitable format limitations; nothing really special about megabuck digital either since digital holds no big secrets anyway. Delusions of grandeur might be a function of big money amongst others but good sound thankfully not.

"As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)"
I know it's said with a smiley-face, but I've always found it rather strange that "megabuck" price gets attached to "killer" sound quality.
Let's be honest that of course companies want (perhaps even need) this association to be made. However, I think audiophiles are recognizing that this is often not the case at all.

I meant killer in the sense...

...of the cream of the crop, which, like anything else in life, comes at a premium.
This doesn't mean that all digital attached to a hefty price tag is going to be killer, and I wholeheartedly agree that there's some great-sounding digital out there that doesn't require mortgaging your house to own. But there's also a reason why Michael Fremer and Jason Victor Serinus bought uber-expensive gear from DCS rather than the $2500.00 offerings from Benchmark or Schitt, as good as the latter companies' goods are. Why else would these professional audio reviewers and lifelong music lovers choose to pay the big bucks?
I haven't heard DCS gear, but I trust MF's and JVS's hearing and their buying decisions.
That's the kind of "killer" I was referring to.

As someone who began reading Stereophile just before the transition from JGH to JA, I have experienced almost the whole range of John Atkinson's editorship (a short lapse during child rearing years). I have appreciated his deft hand on the tiller of Stereophile. I can only hope Jim Austin has as much success during his tenure.
Also since I began reading Stereophile in the first year of my career, I can't begrudge John the chance to step back as I will have been retired for 3 years in June.

Jim Austin. And thank heavens for that. I was recently contemplating that Atkinson must be getting ready to hand over the reigns, and was worried what with the amount of copy he seems to get these days that the successor was going to be named JVS. Don't get me wrong. JVS is a very good writer, but cut him back a little or the magazine will become the JVS Journal.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina | The Latest: Trump meets Chinese leader amid trade war
12/01/2018 Tazeem Anjum
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina— The Latest on President Donald Trump at the Group of 20 summit (all times local):
6:15 p.m.
President Donald Trump is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the countries look for ways to ease an escalating trade war.
Trump suggested to reporters just before the sit-down that at “some point” it could yield “something that will be good for China and good for the United States.” He didn’t elaborate.
Trump and Xi were set to talk over dinner Saturday at a summit of world leaders in Argentina.
The two are trying to negotiate the end to a trade conflict that is rattling financial markets and threatening the world economy. Both sides have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each country’s goods.
Trump said they would also discuss the opioid crisis. He said he hopes China will criminalize fentanyl, the synthetic form of opioids largely shipped from China.
3:50 p.m.
A senior White House official says a joint G-20 statement meets many U.S. objectives, most importantly reforming the World Trade Organization.
President Donald Trump and the other leaders signed the document at the end of a two-day summit of rich and developing nations held in Argentina.
The U.S. supported the language on the WTO but did not sign on to a commitment to support the Paris Climate Accord, which Trump is exiting.
All the other countries agreed to support the statement.
The White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, also noted language on workforce development and women’s economic development and said China committed to doing infrastructure financing on “transparent terms.”
-By Catherine Lucey
3:20 p.m.
President Donald Trump is meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid a global outcry over the death of a U.S.-based columnist who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
Erdogan has sought to keep international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the slaying in October of Jamal Khashoggi. Trump has said there is no definitive evidence that Saudi Arabia’s crown prince is complicit in the killing. He says the kingdom is an important ally that has helped keep oil prices low.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the crown prince must have at least known about the plot to kill Khashoggi.
The two leaders are meeting at the Group of 20 rich and developing nations in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The meeting is closed to reporters.
2:40 p.m.
President Donald Trump held an “informal conversation” with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday.
That’s according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who says the chat occurred during the dinner program at the Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Sanders says that as is typical at multilateral events, the president and first lady had several informal conversations with world leaders at the dinner, including Putin.
Trump and Putin were supposed to have a formal bilateral meeting Saturday at the summit, but Trump called it off Thursday amid spiking tensions over Russia’s seizure of three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crews last weekend.
2:15 p.m.
President Donald Trump is talking trade and other hot-button international issues with German Chancellor Angela Merkel — a leader he says is “highly respected by everybody, including me.”
They are meeting during the Group of 20 summit of rich and developing nations being held in Argentina.
Trump and Merkel will discuss trade, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and Moscow’s violations of a landmark nuclear arms treaty that Trump plans to exit.
Many in Europe have looked to Merkel as Trump has called into question traditional trans-Atlantic ties with his announcements of trade tariffs, repeated criticism of European contributions to NATO and other issues. Merkel has walked a fine line, criticizing some of Trump’s decisions while emphasizing that a good relationship with Washington is central to her government.
2:10 p.m.
President Donald Trump says he expressed his “best wishes” to the Bush family after the death of former President George H.W. Bush.
Trump says he spoke with former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Saturday. He praised the elder Bush, who died Friday, as “a high-quality man who truly loved his family.”
He added that Bush’s death “really puts a damper” on his participation at the international Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Earlier Saturday, Trump cancelled a scheduled summit news conference out of respect for the Bush family. Trump has publicly sparred with the political dynasty, clashing on style and substance.
Trump commented while meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who praised the late Bush one of the fathers of German reunification.
1:15 p.m.
President Donald Trump has ordered American flags to fly at half-staff for 30 days to honor former President George H.W. Bush.
In a proclamation signed Saturday, hours after Bush died, Trump has also designated Wednesday as a national day of mourning. Trump encourages Americans to gather in places of worship “to pay homage” to Bush’s memory.
He adds: “I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.”
Trump hails Bush as “one of America’s greatest points of light,” a reference to one of Bush’s signature phrases about American civic culture.
Trump has mocked the “points of light” phrase, saying at campaign rallies that “I never quite got that one.”
12:40 p.m.
President Donald Trump is cancelling a planned news conference at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina Saturday, “out of respect for the Bush Family” after death of former President George H.W. Bush.
In a tweet, Trump says he was “very much looking forward” to speaking with the news media before leaving the summit in Buenos Aires “because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the G20.”
He adds: “However, out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W. Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference.”
Trump is scheduled to meet down Saturday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Chinese President Xi Jinping before returning to Washington.
4:45 a.m.
When President Donald Trump sits down for dinner Saturday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, their table talk will undoubtedly have a global impact.
Trump and Xi will be seeking a way out of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, while also saving face for their domestic audiences at home. Trump says: “There’s some good signs.
We’ll see what happens.”
The Trump-Xi meeting is the marquee event of Trump’s whirlwind two-day trip to Argentina for the Group of 20 Summit.
Trade analysts and administration officials acknowledge it won’t be easy. The United States and China are locked in a dispute over their trade imbalance and Beijing’s push to challenge American technological dominance.

Cancer Insurance
Cancer in some form and to some degree affects millions of Americans. In the year ahead, significantly greater than a million new cancer cases are likely to be diagnosed, says the American Cancer Society®.1
If your family is struggling with fears of cancer and you reside the Central Florida area, we may be able to help allay at least some of your fears. The knowledgeable and compassionate insurance agents of Sun Coast Legacy Advisors can assist you in finding an insurance plan to cover some, maybe even a large amount, of the likely costs. That's what cancer insurance plans are intended to do.
Treatment costs are but a few of the things cancer policies cover. They also can help you pay for ...
travel
lodging
food
child care
daily bills
other expenses
Let us meet with you to discuss your circumstances privately. At that time, we'll go over what cancer insurance options and benefits we have to offer. Then, together, we'll choose a cancer insurance plan we hope will afford some degree of comfort to you and your loved ones.
Should I Buy Cancer Insurance?
Cancer insurance is a topic not often talked about around the dinner table. It can assuredly be the “white elephant” in the room if you or a loved one has received a cancer diagnosis. Working through such a diagnosis and the difficult treatment procedures that one must endure can be very traumatic. It is possible, however, to take proactive steps to mitigate the trauma associated with at least one aspect of cancer care: how to pay for it.
Cancer insurance might be just what you need. And we at Sun Coast Legacy Advisors can help you determine if this is something you should buy. It’s worth your while to discuss this with us since the health insurance world changes at an ever-increasing pace.
As a rule, many standard cancer treatments were paid for by health insurance companies. Adding a cancer-specific treatment rider to your policy was helpful in terms of taking steps to address a potential diagnosis. But, usually, the insurance companies absorbed the cost of treatment.
The great news is that medical science continues to make new and amazing cancer treatment breakthroughs, and your the likelihood of surviving a cancer diagnosis improve every day. Those breakthroughs are driving the cost of health care higher, though. As a result, most major medical plans, individual health care plans, and Medicare all have much higher deductibles and co-pays.
Unfortunately, the long-term effects of cancer treatment on the patient’s health may cause significant additional financial burdens such as…
health insurance with larger deductibles
Medicare with greater maximum out-of-pocket expenses – many near $6,700 annually
Paying your mortgage while being out of work
the cost of a spouse assisting with appointments and lost wages
travel expenses to specialists
alternative treatments
treatment not covered by your health insurance or Medicare
a much-needed vacation after beating the disease
and other considerations.
Cancer insurance can be a good selection for consumers who want to address the risk of having to pay for these additional burdens. Some carriers sell polices that also allow you to add specific coverage for Heart Attack or Stroke. While these plans do cover a wide range of benefits, premiums can be very reasonable. Buying a policy to handle these potential costs may be a good idea for you and your loved ones. Contact Sun Coast Legacy Advisors. We’d like to ask a few basic questions to help you determine if cancer coverage is appropriate for you. If we agree that it is, we have a few simple ways to set up a policy appropriate for your needs – and your budget.

Costs for Rural Towns Surge after Hurricane Harvey Hits Water Systems
In Patton Village, some residents went weeks without access to clean drinking water, and now their sewer system is running on a “Band-aid.”
by Christopher Collins

Patton Village had just started using its new $10 million wastewater treatment system when Hurricane Harvey wrecked it last month. Floodwaters fried the pumps’ circuitry and flooded a nearby municipal water well. Residents of one neighborhood went weeks without clean water. Repairing the wastewater plant could take months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars that the town doesn’t have.
Located about 30 miles north of Houston in Montgomery County, almost a third of Patton Village’s 1,893 residents are below the poverty level. In fact, the new wastewater treatment system was the first in Patton Village’s history — until this year, the town lacked a comprehensive wastewater system, and the new facility had been hailed as a major sign of progress.
Leah Tarrant, mayor of Patton Village, said the damage was worst in the Peach Creek Dam and Lake Club neighborhood, where 90 homes and a drinking water treatment facility were flooded. The short rows of modest homes, lined with small gardens, pine and magnolia trees, were decimated.
“We had automobiles and motor homes that were literally sucked into the ground,” Tarrant told the Observer. “It looked more like a war zone than a flood zone.” It was three weeks after Harvey made landfall that clean water again could be provided to residents of the Peach Creek area.

Across the state’s coastal areas, raging water from flooded rivers snaked through rural areas and hit water systems hard, gumming up sewer mains with sand and mud, pushing raw sewage into waterways and rendering drinking water wells unusable. As of Monday, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) data showed that 40 counties had issued 367 notices to residents that they’d need to boil water before safely drinking it. But even after water service is fully restored, cities could be holding the bag for millions of dollars in repairs.
In Patton Village, the town’s wastewater pumps are being run by “Band-aid” generators until $150,000 of new electronics can be installed, Tarrant said. The town also must pay about $200,000 to contractors who manually pumped Patton Village’s wastewater in the days directly following the storm. “Now we have so much cost,” she said.
Financial help may come in the form of a grant offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which gives emergency funds to communities whose water infrastructure has been damaged in a disaster. Also, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) helps cities pay to repair damage to publicly owned facilities. Tarrant has applied for both grants. “We are praying for USDA and FEMA assistance,” she said. “I believe we will get it, I just don’t know how soon.”
“If you look at a small community, the single largest capital investment that community will ever make is their water system,” said Nathan Ohle, executive director of the Rural Community Assistance Partnership (RCAP). After disasters, the nonprofit helps small and rural water systems assess damage and apply for grant funding. RCAP estimates that about 30 small and rural water systems in Texas sustained “significant” damage from Harvey. As a result, those communities — likely more than 100,000 people — sometimes didn’t have access to clean drinking water, and may have been exposed to floodwaters containing E. coli, chemicals and other contaminants.

Harvey hit rural water systems with a one-two punch, though the second blow hasn’t fully landed yet. First, the initial damage to infrastructure, which can financially cripple a small community. But the second blow can come as a surprise, with lingering effects. Because most public water systems are sustained by rates paid by residential consumers, towns need residents to use water to finance the system. Put simply: If no one buys water, the city can’t pay to provide it.
“It’s hard enough for a rural community to sustain a water system when things are going well, but in Hurricane Harvey a lot of the housing was damaged and families had to temporarily move out or find new homes,” Ohle said. “There’s a shortage of housing and a shortage of residents who are actually using the system.” Some cities may eventually have to suspend water services, or raise the rates charged to the remaining customers.
Stopgap repairs likely can be made to most small and rural water systems within the next couple of months, but returning water systems to normal will take years, partially because they must conform to federal drinking water standards, said Tommy Ricks, director of environmental services for Communities Unlimited Inc., a partner organization of RCAP. “This recovery process is not a bunch of farmers and ranchers connecting water hoses to get the water to flow again,” Ricks said. “The same standards that apply to Houston apply to Patton Village.”

Cooper Anderson asks Andrew McCabe if Trump is a "Russian asset'
By Jay Jackson, Thailand News
21 Feb 2019, 00:06 GMT+10
NEW YORK, New York - The FBI began an investigation into whether U.S. President Donald Trump was a Russian agent, according to former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
In speaking with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Tuesday, McCabe said he still believes it is possible Mr Trump is a Russian agent.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway initialy when asked about the remark said the question did not dignify a response, but then said, "He's a liar and a leaker."
Anderson's question to the former acting top FBI official was: "Do you still believe the president could be a Russian asset?"
McCabe responded: "I think it's possible. I think that's why we started our investigation, and I'm really anxious to see where Mueller concludes that."
McCabe began his career with the FBI as a street agent in the FBI's New York bureau under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime, which is inextricably linked to the Russian state, and terrorism.
Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft.
While serving under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.
On 16 March last read, a day before he was due to retire from the FBI that he had served with distinction for more than two decades, McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI.
President Trump later tweeted: "Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy."
On Wednesday when asked about recent interviews by McCabe, the president labelled him a "disaster."
"Well, I think Andrew McCabe has made a fool out of himself over the last couple of days, and he really looks to me like sort of a poor mans J. Edgar Hoover,"Trump told repoters at the White House on Wednesday. "Hes a, I think hes a disaster. And what he was trying to do was terrible and he was caught. Im very proud to say we caught him."
"So well see what happens. But he is a disgraced man. He was terminated, not by me; he was terminated by others. The IG report was a disaster, a disaster, from his standpoint. Anybody reading the IG report would say, How could a man like this be involved with the FBI? And the FBI has some of the greatest people, some of the finest people youll ever meet. But this man is a complete disaster," the president said.

Taylor Swift Declares War on Sony Music Over Kesha Contract Fight

Taylor Swift has raised the stakes considerably for Sony Music Entertainment’s contract battle with pop star Kesha. She’s given Kesha $250,000 to underwrite her legal battle on behalf of all female artists.
Kesha’s case has become an unexpected rallying cry for female music artists that has grown to include Demi Lovato, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande and New Zealand singer Lorde.
IM reported Friday (Feb. 19) that a Supreme Court Judge in Manhattan had denied the “Tik Tok” singers request to get out of an eight-album deal with Sony because she claims her producer, Dr. Luke, emotionally and sexually abused her.
Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich ruled that Sony would suffer “irreparable harm,” if the contract was broken. Kesha owes the label six more albums, all of which she agreed to make through Dr. Luke’s Kemosabe Records.
Kornreich cited New York contract law, which typically favors corporations. Kornreich urged Kesha to accept a label offer to let her work with another producer.

Since then, a number of female artists have expressed their support for Kesha, real name Kesha Rose Sebert. But Swift upped the stakes dramatically in a move that’s being interpreted as show of solidarity for feminism.
She donated the money to help cover Kesha’s expenses “during this trying time,” according to a statement released by her spokesman.
Surprisingly, Lovato scolded Swift online for donating the money, but not speaking out publicly about the plight of women in music. That, in turn, produced a sharp reaction from Swift’s fans.
Lovato shot back in a series of Tweets.
“How the fuck am I making this about myself?. At least I’m talking about it. Not everyone has 250k to just give to people. Would love to but I didn’t grow up with money and def haven’t made as much as her. At least I speak up about shit that’s uncomfortable to talk about rather than trying to be politically correct 24/7.”
Later Lovato clarified her remarks even more.
“Didn’t shade Taylor. If you take it that way than fine. I’m just tired of seeing women use ‘women empowerment’ and ‘feminism’ to further brands without actually being the ones that have the uncomfortable conversations. I’m also ready for self-proclaimed feminists to start speaking out or taking action for women’s rights. Women empowerment is speaking up for other women even when it’s something uncomfortable to speak up about.”
So apparently feminism comes in varying shades of grey.
But the bigger question is how Sony intends to get back on top of the issue. Simply citing arcane contract law won’t be enough to quell the outrage generated by Kesha’s battle.
Of course, overlooked in this latest turn, is Dr. Luke’s heated denials that anything inappropriate took place.
IM was one of the first sites to report on the controversy two years ago. It started as a dispute over the creative direction of Kesha’s music.
She wanted Warrior, her second release, to be a rock album. Luke, however, reportedly insisted on dance and electro songs that propelled the success of her first album, Animal.
She hasn’t produced another album in three years.
Let us know your thoughts and be sure to follow IM for the latest developments in the case.

In exchange for including the ambitious target in the final text, developing nations are being pressured to never again mention “liability and compensation.”

EDITOR’S NOTE: The original article used the expression “loss and damage,” which has been replaced in this updated version with “liability and compensation” to more accurately reflect the negotiations. Furthermore, the article has been updated with new information about financial assistance to developing nations.

Paris, France—Entering the closing 48 hours of the global climate negotiations, US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that “we will not leave the most vulnerable nations among us to quite literally weather the storm alone.” Speaking an hour before newly updated negotiating text was released, Kerry also referenced the surprising news from Monday that a temperature limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius—“or as low as we can go” beneath 2 degrees, he said—might be included in the final agreement. But representatives of developing nations complained that, behind closed doors, the United States was demanding two deal-breaking quid pro quos. First, in return for referencing the 1.5 C target, poor and vulnerable nations must agree to never again raise the issue of “liability and compensation” for the climate impacts bound to increasingly afflict those nations in the years ahead. Second, the US has refused to provide the financial assistance poor nations need to pursue a development path consistent with a 1.5 C target—for India, for example, to forego coal-fired power plants in favor of wind and solar.
Ad Policy
In an uncharacteristically animated speech, Kerry made news by announcing that the United States will double its funding for vulnerable countries’ adaptation to climate impacts to $800 million a year by 2020. Beyond that, he largely reiterated the known US position, listing four points the Obama administration wants to see in the final text: The agreement should be “as ambitious as possible”; it should be “flexible,” reflecting the differing economic circumstances of each country; it should include “adaptation and resilience” for the poor and most vulnerable countries, where climate disruption is “a matter of life and death,” and it should “get stronger over time.”
In a speech streamed live throughout the Le Bourget convention center, Kerry told a packed press conference that he was optimistic that the Paris summit will succeed, saying, “We are seeing momentum towards an agreement that has never existed before.” He concluded with unabashed cheerleading, urging his fellow diplomats to “do whatever it takes, make the compromises we need to make, to give the world the agreement it deserves and demands.”
What Secretary Kerry did not say was also important. He did not endorse de-carbonizing the global economy by 2050 or the related imperative of leaving most of the earth’s fossil fuels in the ground, as scientists have said is required to honor the current international goal of limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees C above the pre-industrial level. Nor did he mention “liability and compensation”—a shorthand term for the demand by vulnerable countries for monetary and other assistance to deal with irreparable climate impacts beyond what adaptation can address, such as the disappearance of homelands under rising seas.
Civil society groups expressed varying degrees of enthusiasm for Kerry’s remarks, even as other activists announced plans for a “Red Lines” demonstration in the streets of Paris on Saturday, despite French authorities’ continuing ban on large public protests.
“Secretary Kerry’s commitment to an ambitious deal is clear,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, told The Nation. “This announcement of additional financing—the hardest thing for the US to pledge—shows how committed the US is to a strong outcome. But there is still much more to do.”
“With today’s announcements, Secretary Kerry has just taken the US off the fence on finance and helped boost the elements we need to achieve the 100% clean energy deal the world demands,” said Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director of Avaaz, a citizens movement that claims 42 million members worldwide. “The question now is whether China and India will back the deal, or break it.”

Kyl Ashe, senior legislative representative for Greenpeace USA, praised Kerry’s sense of “urgency” but complained that “the force of his words is not matched by the US financial commitments. The US $800 million he announced, doubling the current commitment, is a positive step, but it’s just a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed.”
Under the banner “It’s Up To Us To Keep It In The Ground,” activists including Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein, Vandanna Shiva, and Rebecca Solnit revealed that thousands of climate-justice activists will lay red tulips (sustainably harvested in Belgium) along an undisclosed boulevard in Paris on Saturday to “honor the past and future victims of climate change” and to demonstrate the climate justice movement’s “commitment to keep fighting to keep fossil fuels in the ground and make a just transition to 100% renewable energy.”
Meanwhile, the surprising news about a possible 1.5 C target in the final agreement continued to cascade through the summit, triggering diverse reactions from governments, activists, and scientists. None of the big powers said to be open to such a move—the United States, the European Union, Canada, China—have disputed the media accounts, indicating the idea is still alive in the back rooms where diplomatic negotiations are now intensifying.
Speaking not for attribution, some US activists suspected a trick. Making a voluntary pledge of 1.5 C is easy, they argued, and not to be taken seriously, given that the current commitments for emissions cuts would produce at least 3 degrees C of warming by 2100. Only a clear, binding commitment to leave fossil fuels behind entirely by 2050, and an ambition mechanism to scale up current commitments accordingly, can deliver the progress science demands.
The view from the global South, on the other hand, focused more on the alleged quid pro quo regarding “liability and compensation.” “The US does not want us to talk about ‘liability and compensation,’ and we have not,’” said Saleem ul Huq, director of the International Center for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh. “But they say, ‘Ah, but you’re thinking about it. Stop thinking about it!’ To ask the most vulnerable nations never to raise this issue in the future is unacceptable to us. Climate change has been caused by the emissions of the wealthy world, but it is the poor who are suffering the worst, and this is morally wrong.”
And while developing countries have the greatest self-interest in a 1.5 C climate scenario, advocates say that they cannot prioritize zero-carbon over climate-destructive development options without financial help—which the wealthy countries are not as yet offering at the necessary scale. Secretary Kerry, in his speech, lauded the US’s participation in a coalition of countries pushing for the most ambitious emissions reductions possible. But the coalition’s stated plans make no provisions for financially assisting developing countries to choose wind, solar and other clean options over dirty oil, coal and gas. (The $800 million in aid Kerry announced is meant for adaptation to climate impacts, not reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.) Solar is cheaper than coal over the long term—its fuel is free—but it can carry high initial capital requirements to construct solar power facilities. Without aid, a country like India, with its abundant domestic coal supplies, has an economic incentive to choose coal over solar, despite the terrible health costs coal imposes both immediately, through increased asthma and lung cancer, and over time through worsened climate disruption. In essence, India ends up subsidizing its economic development with increased sickness and death among its people. “Many leaders say they support a 1.5 degree temperature limit, and we’re heartened to hear that, but that doesn’t change anything if you don’t have a map and a car to get to that destination,” said Ruth Davis, political director at Greenpeace UK. “The ministers are holding the pen. Those of us who have watched for a long time see a new spirit of cooperation, but this cooperation has to result in something real and meaningful.”
Finally, some ask whether it is even possible to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. The world has already warmed by 1 degree C, and the fact that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries insures that temperatures will rise further, no matter how much emissions are reduced post-Paris.
Although it won’t be easy, a 2 degrees C limit can be honored, Dirk Messner, a senior scientist at the German Advisory Council on Global Change, reported during a “side event” at Le Bourget on Tuesday. What’s needed are dramatically different political, economic, and even cultural choices, Messner said, adding that he is relatively optimistic, given the distance the world has traveled since the failed summit in Copenhagen six years ago. “In 2009, our activities towards a zero-carbon economy were occurring at the periphery of our social systems,” he noted. “In 2015, they are taking place in the center of our systems. For example, this year investments in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are resulting in higher energy production than new fossil energy investments are. This is a tipping point. The question is, How do we scale up the pace of change?”
A little-noticed paper published in Nature Climate Change in May by colleagues of Messner at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research made the case that even the 1.5 C limit could be achieved. This would require, however, accepting that temperatures would first rise closer to 2 degrees C before being reduced by the application of carbon-negative practices: using photosynthesis to extract CO2 from the atmosphere by growing trees and planting cover crops that get buried underground. Messner, however, was pessimistic such measures can achieve 1.5 C, calling the scenario “technologically possible, but politically, economically and socially implausible,” because it would mean diverting so much land area that food production and biodiversity would suffer.
But one of the co-authors of the Nature Climate Change study said that this pessimistic view did not necessarily have to hold true. Joeri Rogelj, a scientist with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, agreed that carbon-negative practices could have unwanted problems. But Rogelj told The Nation that the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “identified policy choices by which possible such adverse side effects can be minimized.”
So will the Paris summit end with an agreement that leaves no one behind, as John Kerry urged on Wednesday afternoon? The next 48 hours will be decisive.

'Basketball Wives' Star Tami Roman -- Don't Pull the Show ... MILLIONS Will Suffer
EXCLUSIVE
"Basketball Wives" star Tami Roman is begging a Texas court NOT to let a hairy legal battle stop her reality show from airing ... because, according to her, millions would suffer.
TMZ broke the story ... Roman was sued in March by Crème de la Crème hair company for allegedly bailing on her endorsement duties and then promoting her OWN hair line instead. The company asked the court to stop VH1 from showing any segments where Tami promoted her line instead of theirs.
Now Roman is firing back ... claiming in court docs that she is the VICTIM because Crème didn't pay her on time, thus breaking any obligation she had to them or their hair extensions.
Roman goes on to claim that prohibiting the show from airing would affect "millions of people" and the harm suffered by Crème de la Crème "pales in comparison."
Roman is asking the court to let the show air as is, along with ordering Crème to remove her name and likeness from any products and pay her court costs.
A judge has yet to rule on the case.

Bloomberg: U.S. warns Russia it will hit Assad if he uses chemical arms

U.S. officials say they have information Assad may be planning a chemical attack in the northwestern province of Idlib.
REUTERS
The U.S. has told Russia it is ready to take strong military action against Syria if President Bashar al-Assad uses chemical weapons to recapture one of his country's last rebel-held areas, according to four people familiar with the discussions.
U.S. officials say they have information Assad may be planning a chemical attack in the northwestern province of Idlib. At a Thursday meeting in Geneva, National Security Adviser John Bolton told his Russian counterpart, Nikolai Patrushev, that America is prepared to respond with greater military force than it has used against Assad's regime in the past, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the content of talks hasn't been publicly disclosed, Bloomberg reported.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia is "very concerned" by the threat and suggested possible chemical attack "provocations" assisted by U.S. spy agencies in Syria as a pretext for new U.S. military action. Russian officials told Bolton about their concerns at the Geneva meeting, Ryabkov said in a phone call Saturday with Bloomberg News.
"We caution Washington against another military escapade," Ryabkov said. "When things don't turn out the way the U.S. and its' allies want, then new provocations are prepared."
President Donald Trump has said before that he'll punish Assad for any further use of chemical weapons, after ordering two limited strikes in similar circumstances since taking office early last year. But the latest warning is more specific, and it comes on the eve of what may be one of the bloodiest campaigns in Syria's civil war.
Syrian forces, backed by Russian air power, are deploying around Idlib – the only remaining area where the rebels, now dominated by jihadists from al-Qaeda and other groups, have a significant presence. They are estimated to number tens of thousands of fighters, many of them evacuated to Idlib under cease-fire arrangements as the Assad-Russia-Iran alliance gradually regained control over other parts of Syria.

Unpaid Wages Including Overtime Pay
Our New York and New Jersey overtime pay attorneys represent employees who have been subjected to violations of wage and hour laws by their employers. Conversely, our lawyers have also represented companies who are audited by the United States Department of Labor and/or New York State Labor Department for wage and hour disputes, non-payment for breaks required by labor law, non-payment for spread of hours work and generally unpaid wages. Our New York wages lawyers are very familiar with the technical provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the New York State Minimum Wage Act and other state labor laws. Call us now at (800) 893-9645 to learn your employment law rights.
We Represent Employees and Employers in Disputes Regarding:

Unpaid overtime wages and pay
Unpaid Paid Tme Off (PTO) (example: accrued vacation)
Misclassification of exempt and non-exempt employees
Unpaid sales commissions

Employees are misclassified as an non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law and, as such, are denied overtime
Unequal pay between persons of a different sex or race
In today’s technology driven workplace where employees are required to be available at all times where their movement is restricted and they are an on-call shift, some employees also may have a claim for they work on their blackberry devices, laptops, or other work-related devices when they are away from the office. In addition, some employees may have a claim for pay when they are waiting at the workplace.
Too often employees are fearful of coming forward because their employer has threatened to report their citizenship status if they file a wage complaint. Undocumented employees have rights and should not be abused and taken advantage by unscrupulous employers. Undocumented workers have rights under employment law including the right to be free from retaliation. If you are an undocumented worker, please call our office at (800) 893-9645 for a CONFIDENTIAL discussion regarding your rights to overtime pay and your rights to protection.

Analysts: Sanctions on Iran Complicating Response to Khashoggi Killing

LONDON —
A new round of U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's oil and economic sectors went into effect Monday. And analysts say Western capitals are looking at the dynamics of the world oil market as they debate what action, if any, to take against Iran's neighbor, Saudi Arabia, over the recent death of a dissident Saudi journalist.
The West needs the Gulf kingdom to help make up for any oil supply shortfalls caused by the reinstatement of the sanctions against Iran, they say. Even before the penalties were reimposed, a significant amount of oil from the world market was removed, according to Sarah Ladislaw of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research institution.
“The [Trump] administration has been quick to point out that it is working to ensure oil market stability through liaising with other producing countries and aided by U.S. production growth. All things considered, this may be possible as long as no additional and substantial oil supply disruptions take place, which is far from guaranteed," Ladislaw said.
A still image taken from CCTV video and obtained by TRT World claims to show Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, highlighted in a red circle by the source, as he arrives at Saudi Arabia's Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, Oct. 2, 2018.
Self-exiled dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed last month in Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to collect documents allowing him to remarry. His murder by Saudi agents, some of whom have served in the past as bodyguards for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was belatedly acknowledged by the Saudi government after leaks to the media by Turkish officials providing details over the incident.
Riyadh first claimed Khashoggi left the consulate alive, but was later forced to acknowledge that the journalist had been killed. Saudi officials have maintained the killing was a rogue operation by renegade security and intelligence officials.

The sanctions are aimed at Iran to “abandon its destructive activities,” according to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But the administration appears to be taking care to keep disruption of the oil markets to the minimum. The United States has granted temporary waivers to eight countries for them to continue to buy Iranian oil.
Top Iranian tomp importers granted temporary US sanctions waivers.
Saudi Arabia has promised to increase oil production capacity by a million barrels of oil a day to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil. That pledge emphasizes the importance of Saudi Arabia for the West, both in terms of the oil it can supply and its role as an ally in the Gulf, say analysts.
“Like it or not, Saudi Arabia and its partners need one another; they share a long-held interdependency, and the U.S. in particular now considers Riyadh to be an important plank in its effort to push back against Iran,” Neil Quilliam of Britain’s Chatham House wrote in a recent comment.

Quilliam says Western governments need to recalibrate carefully their relationship with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the Khashoggi murder. The analyst adds the West needs to "set terms that place a constraint upon the adventurism of MBS, accompanied by a list of measures they wish to see from the kingdom, aimed at advancing reforms, restoring lost confidence among international investors and helping to stabilize the region." He acknowledges that will be "a tall order."
Michael Stephens of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research group, says so far, the Saudi explanations for the Khashoggi killing "do not appear to have been enough to stop Western states mulling options for the imposition of targeted sanctions" on the Gulf kingdom. But among the questions Western governments are asking themselves is, "What will the potential impact on world oil prices be, especially with the U.S. threat to Iran’s oil exports?"
He adds, "Would censuring Riyadh lead to an empowerment of Iran, destabilizing the region further and leading to heightened regional tensions above their currently inflamed levels?"
The consequences of the sanctions on Iranian oil exporters are complicated enough to calculate, with or without Saudi production assistance, says Sarah Ladislaw.
Ladislaw argues the granting of waivers to eight countries "takes pressure off the near-term oil price." But, she says, "Uncertainty still exists over how much of Iran’s remaining approximately 1.5 million barrels per day in crude and condensate exports will come off the market both next week and over the long run." Ladislaw noted this was in part due to what she called "lack of clear guidance from the United States regarding sanctions implementation now and going forward."
Secretary Pompeo and other U.S. officials have avoided setting a deadline for the waivers or indicating when a full ban on Iranian oil exports would take effect. They say that the new sanctions, along with others imposed earlier this year as a consequence of Washington’s withdrawal from an international nuclear deal with Tehran, will undermine the Iranian economy. U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear agreement in May, accusing Iran of violating the deal. The Islamic Republic has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
Last week, in the run-up to the reimposition of the oil sanctions, U.S. officials exchanged barbs on social media platforms with Iranian counterparts. On Friday, President Trump invoked the TV show Game of Thrones in a tweet displaying a portrait of himself and the words, “Sanctions are coming” — an apparent reference to the show’s catch phrase, “Winter is coming.”
