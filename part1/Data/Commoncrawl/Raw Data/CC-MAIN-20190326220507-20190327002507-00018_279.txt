David Adjaye’s ‘Living Spaces’
General / People / Products / December 21, 2017	
Houses may represent a smaller portion of David Adjaye’s considerable body of work, but they are more potent as a result. For his new book, “Living Spaces,” he selected projects that are challenging because of their sites, complexity, or architectural possibility – 15 in all, from Africa to Brooklyn. A+A recently interviewed him via email:
What is the purpose of the book?
“Living Spaces” collects nine private residences I have designed over the last decade or so. Together, they represent an exploration of the shape of private life in the 21st century, and architecture’s role in reflecting, supporting or producing these shifts. The book captures the lessons I have learned from working on these spaces, and conveys a general approach to architecture that informs my work on public buildings as well.
What is its intent?
The book starts to think through the interplay of public and private space in the 21st century, and architecture’s role as a special kind of recording devise for these kind of evolutions and shifts. The projects I present here are offered as prototypes for modes of living and engagement with their contexts.
Who is the target audience?
This book is really intended as a conversation about the role of private spaces in contemporary life, and the way architecture informs and records this. I think the book is relevant to anyone working through these issues, whether as designers, practitioners, or simply as casual citizens grappling with the increased density of our urban environments.
Why publish it now?
It has been over 10 years since I published my last book on private residences, and much of the work at that point had focused on interventions into existing structures, primarily in London. Since then, my private realm work has expanded to include a larger diversity of typologies and locations. scope and locations. Because of this, I felt there was now a body of work capable of speaking to the nuanced role of context – the geography, history and culture of a place – in shaping our living spaces.
What was the inspiration for the book?
I wanted to offer a counterpoint to my work on public buildings, which has perhaps been more widely documented in the past 10 years. I wanted to demonstrate the ways in which work in the private realm engages with its own distinct histories and typologies, but still very much deals with the role of the public realm. So the book is about elucidating a comprehensive approach to architecture that revolves around the changing interplay of the public and the private.
What is its scope?
“Living Spaces” covers nine houses across four continents, along with an essay detailing my approach to these private realm works. The accompanying descriptions for each project detail the client’s brief, the challenges of the environment and space, and the solutions uncovered through design.
What does each project in it have in common with the others?
Each project here is a model for discussing the evolution of the home and what it can be in the future. With each, I am concerned with how elements like form, volume, and light can be harnessed to craft spaces that both reflect the demands of our spaces of respite and respond to the specificities of their contexts.

Jesús Huerta de Soto is probably the most important Austro-libertarian thinker you're not reading, but there's an easy solution. His incredible banking treatise, titled Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles, is free online both in English and the original Spanish.
It's a worthwhile read, if not always an easy one. But real knowledge and wisdom are never easily obtained, and Huerta de Soto here gives us a granular account of everything we need to know about how modern banking works: the history and legal principles; the mechanics of deposit contracts; the role of interest rates; fractional reserve and credit expansion; business cycles and malinvestment; and updated critiques of Keynes, monetarism, and free banking.
As such, it's the most important comprehensive Austrian book on money in many decades and deserves a wide audience.
As does the author himself.​ Huerta de Soto, professor of applied economics at King Juan Carlos University in Madrid and hardworking scion of his family's life insurance business, surely ranks among the great Austrians working today. His aforementioned work on money and banking represents only a portion of his academic output, which also includes important work on Hayek, legal theory and contract, the role of insurance in the economy (hint: it doesn't increase the money supply), and the history of the Spanish Scholastics. Somehow he manages to combine economist, writer, professor, insurance CEO, and mentor to younger academics into one prolific career. And he studiously — laboriously — updates Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles constantly, already bringing us to the third English edition and multiple Spanish editions.
Do yourself a favor and become better acquainted with this man and his work. It will be well worth your time.
Applying a businessman's touch, Huerta de Soto called the 2008 financial and monetary crisis with compelling accuracy in the first (1998, Spanish) edition of his treatise. Writing a decade later, in the teeth of that unfolding crises, Huerta de Soto reminds us of his earlier predictions: everything then happening to Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac, and Lehman Brothers, not to mention Europe's sovereign debt crises, was all entirely predictable, and in fact inevitable. It all lay at the feet of the Federal Reserve Bank, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and other profligate bad actors.
Only readers of Professor Huerta de Soto (and of fellow travelers like Dr. Mark Thornton, who called the housing bubble) were braced for the gut punch that was the Crash of 2008.
For this reason alone we should listen to him over the vast majority of monetary economists, who utterly failed even to see the connection between central bank loosening, low interest rates, malinvestment, and bubbles.
We also recommend his sociological treatment titled The Austrian School: Market Order and Entrepreneurial Creativity, published free online by the Institute of Economic Affairs. This is as good a primer on Austrian thought as you'll find anywhere, short, sweet, and succinct at 113 pages.
Huerta de Soto routes us through the key causal-realist principles, always comparing and contrasting those principles with the neoclassical treatment. He anchors acting man, the entrepreneur with finite knowledge and capital, at the forefront of economic analysis — an individual nowhere found in the floating, non-temporal treatment of homogenous capital in macroeconomics. And he gives us superb brief snapshots of Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises, and F.A. Hayek, along with summaries of their major contributions. He concludes with a discussion of the Austrian resurgence of the 1970s, led by Murray Rothbard and Israel Kirzner, while parrying some of the chief empiricist criticisms of Austrian theory and method.
But along with contrasts he also gives us blistering critiques of the supposedly dominant neoclassical paradigm, particularly with respect to the relatively static construct of equilibrium:
It is not surprising that present-day economics, dominated by the mathematical formalism of equilibrium theorists of both perspectives, is deemed to be going through a major crisis. This crisis springs mainly from the following causes: first, theorists’ central preoccupation with states of equilibrium, which have nothing to do with reality but are the only states which can be analysed via mathematical methods; second, the total disregard for the role of dynamic market processes and real-world competition, or the study of these from an unfortunate angle; third, the insufficient attention to the role played in the market by subjective information, knowledge and learning processes; and fourth, the indiscriminate use of macroeconomic aggregates and the concomitant neglect of the study of coordination between the plans of the individual agents who participate in the market. All of these factors explain the lack of understanding in economic science today concerning the weightiest problems of real economic life in our time and, thus, they also account for the state of crisis and increasing loss of prestige in which, by and large, we now find our discipline. The above factors all share a common source: the lack of realism in assumptions, and the attempt to apply a methodology characteristic of the natural sciences to the sciences of human action, a field entirely foreign to it. It is precisely the discipline’s current state of crisis which also explains the strong resurgence, beginning in 1974, of the Austrian school of economics, the members of which have been able to present an alternative paradigm which is far more realistic, coherent and fruitful, with a view to rebuilding our science.
This is vintage Huerta de Soto, identifying not only the mainstream failure to recognize the dynamic elements of an economy but also pointing out the deficiencies of mathematical and statistical aggregates to teach us much of anything. We should recall, as Huerta de Soto reminds us, that "mainstream" economists not only failed to get 2008 right, they blew the whole 20th century by failing to predict the collapse of the former Soviet Union. They neither foresaw the collapse of the USSR's planned economy nor understood the fundamental, inherent problems in the world's dominant anti-market economic system of the last hundred years. The impossibility of socialism, both in terms of market information and property rights, was entirely dismissed by the Keynesian establishment.
But Mises and Hayek were right; Marx and Keynes were wrong. Jesús Huerta de Soto is a worthy heir to the former and a capable slayer of the latter, or at least their acolytes still plaguing us with their demand-side fetishes.

Jewish Groups Helped Florida Felons Gain The Vote
Loretta Pittman
Nov 07, 2018
Florida started permanently barring felons from voting after the Civil War as Congress forced states to ratify the 13th and 14th Amendments guaranteeing all men the right to vote. The language of the amendment excludes those convicted of murder and serious sexual offenses, but supporters still estimate that over 1 million Floridians who have served time in prison would become newly eligible to vote.
For many residents, they say although they've paid a price for their crimes, the lingering effects actions are taking a disproportionate toll. I can't cast a vote for anything.
The passing of Amendment 4 is likely to most benefit voters of colour in Florida, where an estimated one-in-five African American voters could not vote due to their criminal records.
But Republican Governor Rick Scott and the Cabinet ended automatic restoration of voting rights as one of Scott's first acts upon taking office in 2011. While some opponents of the amendment are still in favor of speeding up the process, they claim that Amendment 4 will allow former felons to regain their voting rights automatically, without any process. Whereas most states prohibit people now in prison from voting and some extend this to probation or parole, Florida was one of four states where felon status permanently removed one's voting rights. Florida also accounts for a quarter of the disenfranchised population in the United States, according to the Sentencing Project.
In February, a federal judge ruled the state's policy requiring felons to petition the government to have their voting rights restored was unconstitutional because it was lengthy, arbitrary and forced them to "kow-tow" to the whims of state politicians. Scott and other top officials met only four times a year to consider applications to restore voting rights, causing a backlog of more than 10,000 requests.
More news: Here's how to score free stuff in Orlando on Election Day
The implications for the state's elections are enormous.
Stars like John Legend and Rihanna also expressed their support for the measure.
Shortly after Amendment 4 passed, Trump-aligned Republican Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated progressive Democrat Andrew Gillum in the race for Florida governor.
"This is proof when you speak up and work hard and fight for something you believe in, good things will happen", Stratemann said.
Others celebrated the long-awaited victory, which could shift Florida's future political climate.

a villanelle
The sun descends into the silent sea.
As shadows lengthen in the fading light
I journey on to seek what yet may be.
As death from life yearns to be free,
And grief seeks comfort in the night,
The sun descends into the silent sea.
And as the past with all its misery
Sets with the sun and disappears from sight,
I journey on to seek what yet may be.
And as for love there is no guarantee.
For whether one is in the wrong or right,
The sun descends into the silent sea.
From pain and suffering no one can flee.
And so, amidst the brokenness and blight,
I journey on to seek what yet may be.
Yet hidden in this pain is harmony.
Within my heart its whispered dream burns bright.
The sun descends into the silent sea;
I journey on to seek what yet may be.

I’ve recently come of the opinion that villanelles are hard to write well, and are commonly botched by the incompetent, so I’m glad to read one of clear quality! Great work, James.

This is a very well done villanelle. I agree with David Watt that your refrains are very well chosen. A good refrain should evolve in meaning even as it is repeated, and I think yours do this. I especially like the fourth stanza: it puts things in perspective in an evocative way. Nicely done.

I am grateful for the (so far!) positive response. This was my first attempt at a villanelle and I found it much more challenging than I had anticipated. I had Dylan Thomas’ “do not go gently” in front of me the entire time to serve both as a model and as inspiration. Aim high and you might hit something.
Reply
C.B. Anderson July 21, 2018
James,
All of the comments were on point, and I just want to add that your rhetorical connections from line to line were superb, where the failure to accomplish this is the downfall of many a villanelle. Also, this poem was thematically very coherent, which is always a good thing. Though Thomas’ villanelle might be the most famous one in English, I don’t think it’s the best by a long shot.
Reply
Leo Yankevich July 22, 2018
C.B.,
Thomas’ villanelle is the best written by anyone anywhere at anytime. The second best is Auden’s:
If I Could Tell You
Time will say nothing but I told you so
Time only knows the price we have to pay;
If I could tell you I would let you know.
If we should weep when clowns put on their show,
If we should stumble when musicians play,
Time will say nothing but I told you so.
There are no fortunes to be told, although,
Because I love you more than I can say,
If I could tell you I would let you know.
The winds must come from somewhere when they blow,
There must be reason why the leaves decay;
Time will say nothing but I told you so.
Perhaps the roses really want to grow,
The vision seriously intends to stay;
If I could tell you I would let you know.
Suppose the lions all get up and go,
And the brooks and soldiers run away;
Will Time say nothing but I told you so?
If I could tell you I would let you know.
–W.H. Auden (21 February 1907 – 29 September 1973)
Mr Tweedie’s attempt is lightweight, a symphony of clichés. However, it is not terrible, and deserves its due.
Reply
Leo Yankevich July 22, 2018
Here is my attempt at the villanelle, published in Triancria:
“Your Mother’s Eyes, Your Father’s Chin”
When you kneel down to feed the poor
they’ve got to have your mother’s eyes,
your father’s chin. Spurn, curse the Moor.
Muhammad, scornful to the core,
dreams of a Euro Paradise
when you kneel down to feed the poor.
Stupidity is not a cure.
Look at the anger in their eyes,
hate in their mouths. Spurn, curse the Moor.
The haughty Mullah can say more,
on the blond beach, a lord of flies,
when you kneel down to feed the poor.
Lock the front gate and bolt the door;
defend your blood; pray to the skies,
to Mars or Thor. Spurn, curse the Moor.
Love not thy foe, defiant, sure,
you have been fed a pack of lies.
When you kneel down to feed the poor
think of your own. Spurn, curse the Moor.

Here’s the third best villanelle, in my opinion:
The Waking
BY THEODORE ROETHKE
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I feel my fate in what I cannot fear.
I learn by going where I have to go.
We think by feeling. What is there to know?
I hear my being dance from ear to ear.
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
Of those so close beside me, which are you?
God bless the Ground! I shall walk softly there,
And learn by going where I have to go.
Light takes the Tree; but who can tell us how?
The lowly worm climbs up a winding stair;
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
Great Nature has another thing to do
To you and me; so take the lively air,
And, lovely, learn by going where to go.
This shaking keeps me steady. I should know.
What falls away is always. And is near.
I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow.
I learn by going where I have to go.
William Empson’s gets honorable mention;
Villanelle
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
Your chemic beauty burned my muscles through.
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.
What later purge from this deep toxin cures?
What kindness now could the old salve renew?
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
The infection slept (custom or changes inures)
And when pain’s secondary phase was due
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.
How safe I felt, whom memory assures,
Rich that your grace safely by heart I knew.
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
My stare drank deep beauty that still allures.
My heart pumps yet the poison draught of you.
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.
You are still kind whom the same shape immures.
Kind and beyond adieu. We miss our cue.
It is the pain, it is the pain endures.
Poise of my hands reminded me of yours.

James, I like the poem. I might change “amidst” to “amid,” to make the line flow more smoothly.

1. The opening stanza of Mr. Tweedie’s “I Journey On” demonstrates the heights of purity, which his poetry occasionally attains.
2. Although I do not generally like the villanelle, it appears New Millennial writers are continuing to crank them out.
3. Though I find I frequently disagree with Mr. Yankevich in his literary assessments, and I would never put it this way, I absolutely agree with him that “Thomas’ villanelle is the best written by anyone anywhere anytime” in English, which I have argued before on these literary strands, and which, if memory serves me correctly, Mr. MacKenzie disagreed with and Mr. Sale concurred.
4. I am less impressed with the other villanelles; but what a nice reminder of the poetry of Roethke (1908-1963). I never think of his poetry these days, but reading his villlanelle that Mr. Yankevich placed on this strand, brought back to mind his poetic oeuvre, which rushed into my mind, like a Northwestern American river flowing through the wild. It was refreshing, to say the least.

Wilbur Dee Case,
I failed to mention EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON’s
“The House on the Hill”
They are all gone away,
The house is shut and still,
There is nothing more to say.
Through broken walls and gray
The winds blow bleak and shrill:
They are all gone away.
Nor is there one today
To speak them good or ill:
There is nothing more to say.
Why is it then we stray
Around the sunken sill?
They are all gone away.
And our poor fancy-play
For them is wasted skill:
There is nothing more to say.
There is ruin and decay
In the House on the Hill
They are all gone away,
There is nothing more to say.
or
“Villanelle of Change”
Since Persia fell at Marathon,
The yellow years have gathered fast:
Long centuries have come and gone.
And yet (they say) the place will don
A phantom fury of the past,
Since Persia fell at Marathon;
And as of old, when Helicon
Trembled and swayed with rapture vast
(Long centuries have come and gone),
This ancient plain, when night comes on,
Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,
Since Persia fell at Marathon.
But into soundless Acheron
The glory of Greek shame was cast:
Long centuries have come and gone,
The suns of Hellas have all shone,
The first has fallen to the last:—
Since Persia fell at Marathon,
Long centuries have come and gone.
Anyway, all of the villanelles I have posted could be considered “the best,” but few poets today could aspire to such heights.
Best

Regarding Roethke, kindly recall this:
IN A DARK TIME
In a dark time, the eye begins to see,
I meet my shadow in the deepening shade;
I hear my echo in the echoing wood—
A lord of nature weeping to a tree.
I live between the heron and the wren,
Beasts of the hill and serpents of the den.
What’s madness but nobility of soul
At odds with circumstance? The day’s on fire!
I know the purity of pure despair,
My shadow pinned against a sweating wall.
That place among the rocks—is it a cave,
Or winding path? The edge is what I have.
A steady storm of correspondences!
A night flowing with birds, a ragged moon,
And in broad day the midnight come again!
A man goes far to find out what he is—
Death of the self in a long, tearless night,
All natural shapes blazing unnatural light.
Dark, dark my light, and darker my desire.
My soul, like some heat-maddened summer fly,
Keeps buzzing at the sill. Which I is I?
A fallen man, I climb out of my fear.
The mind enters itself, and God the mind,
And one is One, free in the tearing wind.
This is greatness.
Roethke was a much better poet than the poetaster Robby Lowell.

Gingrich: Romney ‘Sucking Up’ To Trump

Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter
Newt Gingrich, continuing his public crusade against Mitt Romney, mocked him for “sucking up” to President-elect Donald Trump, after the two men went to dinner together on Tuesday night.
Gingrich told conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, “You have never, ever in your career seen a serious adult who’s wealthy, independent, has been a presidential nominee, suck up at the rate that Mitt Romney is sucking up,” Gingrich said. He has actively voiced his discontent at the possibility of Romney serving as Secretary of State. Read more at POLITICO.

SORRY NEWT, NOBODY KISSED UP TO TRUMP MORE THAN YOU!!!

Mittens threw the election to Obama because he was so so scared of the corrupt DNC controlled media calling him a racist.
Mittens rule #1: If you criticize Mr. Obama, you are a racist. Mr. Obama is black. If you can’t criticize Mr. Obama so it shows, that you agree with everything he did. If you agree with everything he has done/doing, why should we vote for you? Everything is just great. No?
So we see that Mittens is a very little baby who is scared of names people might call him. It might hurt his feelings. He might want to curl up into a ball, just like Hillary.
Pass me the box of tissues please.
Mr. Mittens has shown that he is unfit for public office. Case closed.

Facts About Narconon
Narconon demonstrates the workability of the drug-free social education model. Their drug rehabilitation does not use more drugs to solve the problem of drug and alcohol abuse. We have found that effective education must be a fundamental component of the rehabilitation process in order for alcohol and other drug abusers to stably recover and live ethical and productive lives.
Workability is the watchword. The key in developing the Narconon program has been what works  not fads, not what is politically correct. What we have looked at from the beginning and still examine routinely is, Are we returning former addicts to society as stable, productive, ethical, drug-free individuals?
There is not often good news in our struggle with the consequences of alcohol and other drug abuse in our society. I am happy to say that the Narconon program is good news. I encourage you to review it carefully and consider utilizing it. Many years ago I did and I have been able to help save many lives as a result.
Megan Shields, M.D.
Dr. Shields graduated from the Medical College of Virginia and is a Diplomat of the American Board of Family Practice. She is a frequent presenter at conferences on Substance Abuse and Public Health as well as being the author of many scientific papers on the role of detoxification of drug and other toxic residuals. See A Physician's Perspective for a more complete statement of Dr. Shields experience with the Narconon program.

Diogo Dalot: Manchester United hosting Fulham a 'big game' after winless run
08 December 2018
Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot is confident that his side can still finish in the top four this season despite now sitting six points behind Chelsea and Arsenal. We need the points to climb the table.
United welcome bottom side Fulham to Old Trafford on Saturday, looking to claim their first Premier League victory since November 2.
"It was a good season for me on a personal level last season and an enjoyable summer and I wanted to kickstart this season in the same form", he said.
More news: Six dead in stampede at Italian nightclub: Firefighters
"I think it is our main goal for now to get into the top four and we are going to fight for that and I think are will get there".
"Especially this month there's a lot of games, so we need everyone in the squad to be fully fit".
"I needed to be ready to come here and to settle here", the Portuguese said.
More news: Schmidt scores twice as Knights beat Capitals 5-3
Not least, the collective spirit shown by the players after controversial midfielder Paul Pogba was left on the bench for most of the game.
Lingard added: "There's always pressure on people's shoulders when it comes to Man United and it's how you deal with the pressure". Arsenal twice led at Old Trafford but they saw those goals cancelled minutes later and Iwobi acknowledged that, instead of slowing down the tempo and trying to maintain the flow of the game at their own pace, Arsenal got really excited and tried to do everything to overwhelm their hosts. Try to work harder and try to do what we are doing to try to win as many games as possible.
"The first pretty much 20 seconds got the crowd up on their feet and it kind of gave us a buzz after that". Every day we are working with the movies and with tactical moments on the pitch before the matches, we are repeating that.
More news: Epic Games’ store is now open, promises a free title every fortnight
"I think we had two good reactions after their goals and at the end it was a draw". "But today was a tough game".

Background:
On 20 January 2017, the Special Session of the UN Forum on Forests adopted the recommendations of the Working Group of the Forum, which featured the first ever UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030 and the Quadrinnial Programme of Work of the Forum for 2017-2020.
The UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030 provides a global framework for actions at all levels to sustainably manage all types of forests and trees outside forests and halt deforestation and forest degradation.At the heart of the Strategic Plan are six Global Forest Goals and 26 associated targets to be achieved by 2030, which are voluntary and universal. They support the objectives of the International Arrangement on Forests and aim to contribute to progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the Paris Agreement adopted under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and other international forest-related instruments, processes, commitments and goals.
As outlined in the Quadrennial programme of work of the Forum for the period 2017-2020, under the Forum’s new format – odd-year sessions will focus on discussions on implementation, technical advice and exchange of experiences while even-year sessions will focus on policy dialogue, development and decision-making.

Humana, Inc. v. Commissioner 1 881 F.2d 247 (6th Cir. 1989) United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit Humana Inc., Petitioner-Appellant, v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Respondent-Appellee - The Feldman Law Firm LLP
Humana, Inc. v. Commissioner 1
881 F.2d 247 (6th Cir. 1989)
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
HUMANA INC.,
Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE
Respondent-Appellee.
Docket No. 88-1403
Date of Decision: July 27, 1989
Judge: Martin, opinion
Principal Code Reference: Section 162
ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT
Decided and Filed July 27, 1989
Before: Martin and Milburn, Circuit Judges; and Hackett, * District Judge.
BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., CIRCUIT JUDGE. Humana Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries with which it files a consolidated federal income tax return appeal the decision of the United States Tax Court determining deficiencies against them with respect to their 1976-1979 fiscal years on the basis that: 1) sums paid by Humana Inc. to its captive insurance subsidiary, Health Care Indemnity, on its own behalf and on behalf of other wholly owned subsidiaries did not constitute deductible insurance premiums under the Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954), and 2) such payments are not deductible under the Internal Revenue Code section 162 (1954) as ordinary and necessary business expenses as payments to a captive insurance company are equivalent to additions to a reserve for losses.
Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries operate hospitals whose insurance coverage was cancelled. Humana Inc. incorporated Health Care Indemnity, Inc., as a Colorado captive insurance company. In order to facilitate the incorporation of Health Care Indemnity, Humana Inc. also incorporated Humana Holdings, N.V., as a wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherland Antilles. The only business purpose of Humana Holdings was to assist in the capitalization of Health Care Indemnity. /1/ At the time of the initial capitalization, Health Care Indemnity issued 150,000 shares of preferred stock and 250,000 shares of common stock. Of these, Humana Holdings, the wholly owned Netherland subsidiary, purchased the preferred stock for $250,000.00 in cash (its entire capitalization) and Humana Inc. purchased 150,000 shares of Health Care Indemnity's common stock for $750,000.00 in the form of irrevocable letters of credit (as provided by Colorado statute).
Health Care Indemnity, the captive insurance subsidiary of Humana Inc., provided insurance coVerage for Humana Inc. and its other subsidiaries. Humana Inc. paid to Health Care Indemnity amounts which it treated as insurance premiums. Humana Inc. allocated and charged to the subsidiaries portions of the amounts paid representing the share each bore for the hospitals each operated. The remainder represented Humana Inc.'s share for the hospitals which it operated. The total sums, $21,055,575.00, were deducted on a consolidated income tax return as insurance premiums.
The Commissioner, in accordance with the position outlined in Rev. Rul. 77-316, 1977-2 C.B. 52, disallowed the deductions and asserted deficiencies against Humana Inc. and the subsidiaries. Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries filed petitions in the tax court for redeterminations of the deficiencies assessed against them. On August 14, 1985, the tax court issued a memorandum opinion upholding the Commissioner's determination. Following a petition for reconsideration, the tax court withdrew that opinion. Humana Inc. requested full court review. On January 26, 1987, the tax court, after review by the entire nineteen member court, upheld the Commissioner. Humana Inc. and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner, 88 T.C. 197 (1987).
The opinion of the tax court contains a twelve member majority written by Judge Goffe, an eight member concurrence written by Judge Whitaker and joined by seven members of the majority, a two member concurring opinion written by Judge Hamblen and joined by Judge Whitaker, and a seven member dissent written by Judge Korner. The twelve member majority relied on its prior decisions in Carnation Company v. Commissioner, 71 T.C. 400 (1978), affd. 640 F.2d 1010 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 965 (1981) and Clougherty Packing Company v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 948 (1985), affd. 811 F.2d 1297 (9th Cir. 1987), and held 1) that sums paid by Humana Inc. to Health Care Indemnity on its own behalf (described as the "parent- subsidiary" issue) were not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses for insurance premiums, and 2) the sums charged by Humana Inc. to the operating subsidiaries (described as the "brother- sister" issue) were also not deductible on the consolidated income tax returns as ordinary and necessary business expenses for insurance premiums. The majority reasoned that there was no insurance because the risks of loss were not shifted from Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries to Health Care Indemnity. In so holding, the majority specifically rejected adoption of the economic family concept argued by the Commissioner.
The tax court noted that the second issue, the brother-sister issue -- whether the sums charged by Humana Inc. to its operating subsidiaries were deductible on the consolidated income tax returns as ordinary and necessary business expenses as insurance premiums -- was an issue of first impression before the court. The court claimed that the issue had been decided in favor of denying the premiums as deductible in two other cases, Stearns-Roger Corp. v. United States, 774 F.2d 414 (10th Cir. 1985) and Mobil Corp. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 555 (1985). The majority stated that Stearns-Roger and Mobil extended the rationale of Carnation and Clougherty to the "brother- sister" factual pattern. In holding that Humana Inc. did not shift the risk from the subsidiaries to Health Care Indemnity by charging its subsidiaries portions of the amounts paid representing the share each bore for the hospitals each operated, the tax court accepted the joint opinion of two experts, Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart. Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart stated:
Commercial insurance is a mechanism for transferring the financial uncertainty arising from pure risks faced by one firm to another in exchange for an insurance premium.... The essential element of an insurance transaction from the standpoint of the insured (e.g. Humana and its hospital network), is that no matter what perils occur, the financial consequences are known in advance. . . . A firm placing its risk in a captive insurance company in which it holds a sole . . . ownership position, is not relieving itself of financial uncertainty. . . . True insurance relieves the firm's balance sheet of any potential impact of the financial consequences of the insured peril. . . . [However] as long as the firm deals with its captive, its balance sheet cannot be protected from the financial vicissitudes of the insured peril.
Humana, 88 T.C. at 219-25 (1987).
The majority also declared that payments to a captive insurance company are equivalent to additions to a reserve for losses and, therefore, not deductible under the Internal Revenue Code section 162 (1954) as ordinary and necessary business expenses paid or incurred during the taxable years in issue. Stearns-Roger Corp. v. United States, 774 F.2d 414 (10th Cir. 1985); Mobil Oil Corp. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 555 (1985).
The eight member concurrence agreed with the majority's conclusion on both issues but felt uncomfortable with the majority's reliance on the expert witnesses, Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart, whose theories rested heavily upon the economic family concept of captive insurance companies. They wrote to affirm that they were holding against Humana solely on the basis that the contracts between Humana Inc. and Health Care Indemnity and the contracts between Humana Inc.'s subsidiaries and Health Care Indemnity were not insurance contracts because of the lack of risk shifting. Humana, 88 T.C. at 231 (1987) (Whitaker, J., concurring).
A two member concurrence wrote to express concern about the "economic family" concept. They noted that the Commissioner's discussions of the economic family concept did not square with Moline Properties v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436 (1943). The Supreme Court in Moline Properties held that each corporate taxpayer was a separate entity for tax purposes. The two person concurrence felt that the Moline Properties issue was injected unnecessarily by way of the economic family concept analogy. The two member concurrence noted that the majority cites proponents of the economic family concept and felt that this was neither appropriate nor necessary. The two member concurrence stated that they "strongly believe that we should decide the issue solely on a lack of risk shifting and risk distribution basis." Humana, 88 T.C. at 237 (1987) (Hamblen, J., concurring).
The seven member dissent concurred in part with the majority that the premiums paid to Health Care Indemnity by Humana Inc. for insurance on itself may not be deducted as insurance premiums. They dissented with respect to the majority's holding that the same result applies to premiums paid by Humana Inc.'s subsidiaries to Health Care Indemnity for comparable insurance on THEM and THEIR EMPLOYEES. The dissent stated that neither Carnation nor Clougherty decided the issue of deductability of insurance premiums where the insurance contract was between corporations related as brother and sister. The dissent stated that the record in this case showed that 1) the wholly owned subsidiaries of Humana Inc. were insured under the subject policies, 2) the subsidiaries were related to Health Care Indemnity as brother-sister, not as parent-subsidiaries, 3) the amounts due under the subject policies as premiums were billed by Health Care Indemnity to Humana on a monthly basis, 4) Humana paid the total amount billed by Health Care Indemnity on a monthly basis, 5) later, the foregoing amounts were allocated and charged back by Humana, Inc. to its appropriate subsidiaries.
The dissent further noted that the majority rested heavily upon the joint opinion of the experts Plotkin and Stewart. However, these opinions gave no support to the position of the majority on the brother-sister question. The thrust of the Plotkin, Stewart testimony was aimed at the parent-subsidiary question, the reasoning being that the subsidiary's stock was shown as an asset on the parent's balance sheet. If the parent suffered an insured loss which a subsidiary had to pay, the assets of the subsidiary insurer would be depleted by the amount of the payment. This, in turn, reduced the value of the subsidiary shares as an asset of the parent. In effect, the assets of the insured parent were bearing the loss as far as the true economic impact was concerned. The dissent claimed that the reasoning presented by the experts provided no support for the majority's position in the brother-sister context. Humana, 88 T.C. at 243-44 (1987) (Korner J., dissenting). Humana Inc.'s insured subsidiaries owned no stock in Health Care Indemnity, nor vice versa. The subsidiarys' balance sheets and net worth were in no way affected by the payment of an insured claim by Health Care Indemnity. When the subsidiaries paid their own premiums for their own insurance, they shifted their risks to Health Care Indemnity. The dissent argued that the rationale of Carnation and Clougherty thus did not apply. Id. at 247.
The dissent further noted that the cases cited by the tax court, Stearns-Roger, Mobil Oil, and Beech Aircraft v. United States, 797 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1986), each explicitly or implicitly adopted the economic family concept. However, Health Care Indemnity and the hospital subsidiaries were valid separate business entities conducting active legitimate businesses devoid of sham. No facts stated the contrary. The dissent argued that to hold the insurance contracts between them invalid because they are one "economic family" and what happens to one happens to all of them ignored the separate entities of Humana Inc., its hospital subsidiaries, and Health Care Indemnity. Such a holding violated the time honored rule under Moline Properties that each taxpayer is a separate entity for tax purposes.
I.
We review de novo the legal standard applied by the tax court in determining whether Humana Inc.'s payments to its captive insurance company, Health Care Indemnity, for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries constitute ordinary and necessary business expenses for insurance. Rose v. Commissioner, 868 F.2d 851 (6th Cir. 1989). The tax court's findings of fact shall not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. Id. at 853.
The Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954) allows a deduction for all ordinary and necessary business expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business. Insurance premiums in the case of a business are generally deductible business expenses. Treas. Reg. section 1.1621( a) (1954). Although the term "insurance" is not self-defined by the Internal Revenue Code, the Supreme Court in Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531 (1943), provided the test for defining "insurance" for federal tax purposes.
An insurance contract involves (1) risk shifting and (2) risk distribution. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 539 (1943) (where an annuity contract completely neutralized the risk inherent in a life insurance contract when both contracts were considered together as one transaction). Risk shifting involves the shifting of an identifiable risk of the insured to the insurer. The focus is on the individual contract between the insured and the insurer. Risk distribution involves shifting to a group of individuals the identified risk of the insured. The focus is broader and looks more to the insurer as to whether the risk insured against can be distributed over a larger group rather than the relationship between the insurer and any single insured. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Treganowan, 183 F.2d 288, 291 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 853 (1950).
We believe that the tax court correctly held on the first issue, the parent-subsidiary issue, that under the principles of Clougherty and Carnation the premiums paid by Humana Inc., the parent to Health Care Indemnity, its wholly owned subsidiary, did not constitute insurance premiums and, therefore, were not deductible. Humana Inc. did not shift the risk to Health Care Indemnity. As the Tenth Circuit stated in Stearns-Roger:
The comparison of the arrangement here made to self-insurance cannot be ignored. The parent provided the necessary funds to the subsidiary by way of what it called "premiums" to meet the casualty losses of the parent. The subsidiary retained these funds until paid back to the parent on losses. . . . In the case before us we must again consider economic reality. The sums were with the subsidiary for future use and would be included in the Stearns-Roger balance sheet. Again the risk of loss did not leave the parent corporation.
Stearns-Roger, 744 F.2d at 416-1 7. We believe the tax court also correctly held that IF the subject payments made by the wholly owned subsidiaries were not deductible as insurance premiums, they likewise should be considered additions to a reserve for losses and not deductible under the Internal Revenue Code section 162 (1954) as ordinary and necessary business expenses. Stearns-Roger, 774 F.2d at 415; Mobil Oil, 8 Cl. Ct. at 567; Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. United States, 577 F.2d 279, 280 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 946 (1979); Spring Canyon Coal v. Commissioner, 43 F.2d 78 (10th Cir. 1930), cert. denied 284 U.S. 654 (1931). We find no error in fact or law with regard to this first issue.
With regard to the second issue, the brother-sister issue, we believe that the tax court incorrectly extended the rationale of Carnation and Clougherty in holding that the premiums paid by the subsidiaries of Humana Inc. to Health Care Indemnity, as charged to them by Humana Inc., did not constitute valid insurance agreements with the premiums deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954). We must treat Humana Inc., its subsidiaries and Health Care Indemnity as separate corporate entities under Moline Properties. When considered as separate entities, the first prong of Le Gierse is clearly met. Risk shifting exists between the subsidiaries and the insurance company. There is simply no direct connection in this case between a loss sustained by the insurance company and the affiliates of Humana Inc. as existed between the parent company and the captive insurance company in both Carnation and Clougherty.
In so stating, we adopt the analysis of the Ninth Circuit in Clougherty. It dealt with the parent-subsidiary issue and held that Clougherty could not deduct payments as insurance to Lombardy, its captive insurance company, as there was no risk shifting. Its holding was explained as follows, 811 F.2d at 1305.:
In reaching our holding, we do not disturb the legal status of the various corporate entities involved, either by treating them as a single unit or otherwise. Rather, we examine the economic consequences of the captive insurance arrangement to the "insured" party to see if that party has, in fact, shifted the risk. In doing so, we look only to the INSURED'S ASSETS, i.e., those of Clougherty. . . . Viewing only Clougherty's assets and considering only the effect of a claim on those assets, it is clear that the risk of loss has not been shifted from Clougherty. (emphasis added).
Because the Ninth Circuit's analysis does "not disturb the separate legal status of the various corporate entities," we adopt the same line of reasoning to decide the brother-sister issue in the case before us. If we look solely to the insured's assets, i.e., those of the various affiliates of-Humana Inc., and consider only the effect of a claim on those assets, it is clear that the risk of loss has shifted from the various affiliates to Health Care Indemnity.
The only open question is whether there was risk distribution, the second prong of the test for an insurance contract under Le Gierse. We hold that there was both risk shifting and risk distribution between the subsidiaries and the captive insurance company. The tax court, therefore, erred on this second "brother- sister" issue.
II.
A. RISK SHIFTING
We recognize, as we must, the separate corporate existence of the affiliates of Humana Inc. and that of Health Care Indemnity. As the Supreme Court stated in Moline Properties, "[S]o long as [its] purpose is the equivalent of business activity or is followed by the carrying on of business by the corporation, the corporation remains a separate taxable entity." Moline Properties, 319 U.S. at 439. See Clougherty, 811 F.2d at 1302 (where the Ninth Circuit stated that, "While Moline Properties concerned an attempt by the sole shareholder of a corporation to report on his personal return income attributable to the corporation, the rule it enunciates applies as well to a corporation and its subsidiaries."). See also National Carbide Corporation v. Commissioner, 336 U.S. 422, 429 (1949) (where the Moline Properties doctrine was applied for federal income tax purposes even where a parent corporation controlled its wholly-owned subsidiary). We, therefore, look solely to the relationship between the affiliates and Health Care Indemnity and conclude the facts of this case support a finding of risk shifting as between the affiliates of Humana Inc. and Health Care Indemnity.
Health Care Indemnity met the State of Colorado's statutory minimum requirements for an insurance company, was recognized as an insurance company following an audit and certification by the State of Colorado, and is currently a valid insurance company subject to the strict regulatory control of the Colorado Insurance Department. The State of Colorado has either approved or established the premium rate for insurance between the Humana affiliates and Health Care Indemnity. As a valid insurance company under Colorado law, Health Care Indemnity's assets cannot be reached by its shareholders except in conformity with the statute. Colorado Rev. Stat. 10-3-503.
Health Care Indemnity was fully capitalized and no agreement ever existed under which the subsidiaries or Humana Inc. would contribute additional capital to Health Care Indemnity. The hospital subsidiaries and Humana Inc. never contributed additional amounts to Health Care Indemnity nor took any steps to insure Health Care Indemnity's performance. It is also undisputed that the policies purchased by the hospital subsidiaries and Humana Inc. were insurance policies as commonly understood in the industry. The hospital subsidiaries and Humana Inc. entered into bona fide arms length contracts with Health Care Indemnity. Health Care Indemnity was formed for legitimate business purposes. Health Care Indemnity and the hospital subsidiaries conduct legitimate businesses and are devoid of sham. No suggestion has been made that the premiums were overstated or understated. Health Care Indemnity did not file its income tax returns on a consolidated basis with Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. Humana Inc.'s insured subsidiaries own no stock in Health Care Indemnity, nor vice versa.
As noted, supra, the tax court majority cites Mobil Oil in support of its holding on the brother-sister issue. The court in Mobil Oil stated that the imposition of a tax must be based on economic reality and the incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of the transaction and the relationship of the parties. Mobil Oil, 8 Cl. Ct. at 567. The economic reality of insurance between a parent and a captive insurance company is that the captive's stock is shown as an asset on the parent's balance sheet. If the parent suffers an insured loss which the captive has to pay, the assets of the captive will be depleted by the amount of the payment. This will reduce the value of the captive's shares as an asset of the parent. In effect, the assets of the parent bear the true economic impact of the loss. The economic reality, however, of insurance between the Humana subsidiaries and Health Care Indemnity, where the subsidiaries own no stock in the captive and vice versa, is that when a loss occurs and is paid by Health Care Indemnity the net worth of the Humana affiliates is not reduced accordingly. The subsidiaries' balance sheets and net worth are not affected by the payment of an insured claim by Health Care Indemnity. In reality, therefore, when the Humana subsidiaries pay their own premiums under their own insurance contracts, as the facts show, they shift their risk to Health Care Indemnity.
The tax court majority has argued that Stearns-Roger and Mobil extend the rationale of Carnation and Clougherty to cover the brother-sister factual pattern of Humana in favor of denying deductions of payments by the Humana affiliate corporations. The tax court majority stated that "they likewise extend the rationale to the . . . brother-sister factual pattern presented in the case." Humana, 88 T.C. at 217.
Neither Carnation nor Clougherty themselves, nor Stearns-Roger nor Mobil Oil provide a basis for denying the deductions in the brother-sister issue. Carnation did not deal with a captive insurance company of a parent corporation insuring separate and distinct wholly owned affiliate corporations of that parent. Carnation dealt solely with the parent-subsidiary issue, not the brother-sister issue. Likewise, Clougherty dealt only with the parent-subsidiary issue and not the brother-sister issue. Nothing in either Carnation or Clougherty lends support for denying the deductibility of the payments in the brother-sister context.
Stearns-Roger and Mobil Oil also do not provide a basis for extending Carnation and Clougherty to cover the brother-sister situation because both clearly rest on the economic family argument that the tax court claimed to reject in Humana. The court in Mobil Oil made no distinctions between the various entities involved -- Mobil, its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and the various captive insurance companies. The court treated them all as one economic unit. The court cited for support cases resting on the economic family argument, looked only to the parent and stated that the "risk of loss remains with the parent," and thus there was no insurance. Mobil Oil 8 Cl. Ct. at 570.
The Tenth Circuit in Stearns-Roger v. United States, 774 F.2d 414 (1985), rested its holding impliedly if not expressly on the economic family theory. On appeal pursuant to certification under section 1292(b), the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's holding, 577 F.Supp. 833, 838 (1984), in which the district court concluded:
Its [Glendale Insurance Company] only business is to insure its parent corporation which wholly owns it and ultimately bears any losses or enjoys any profits it produces. Both profits and losses stay within the Stearns-Roger "economic family." I conclude that since the agreement between Stearns-Roger and Glendale did not shift the risk of losses, it was not an insurance contract for federal tax purposes. /2/
The tax court cannot avoid direct confrontation with the separate corporate existence doctrine of Moline Properties by claiming that its decision does not rest on "economic family" principles because it is merely RECLASSIFYING or RECHARACTERIZING the transaction as nondeductible additions to a reserve for losses. The tax court argues in its opinion that such "recharacterization" does not disregard the separate corporate status of the entities involved, but merely disregards the particular transactions between the entities in order to take into account SUBSTANCE over form and the economic reality" of the transaction that no risk has shifted.
The tax court misapplies this substance over form argument. The substance over form or economic reality argument is not a broad legal doctrine designed to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate transactions and employed at the discretion of the tax court whenever it feels that a taxpayer is taking advantage of the tax laws to produce a favorable result for the taxpayer. Higgins v. Smith, 308 U.S. 473, 476 (1940) (where the Court stated, "The Government urges that the principle underlying Gregory v. Helvering finds expression in the rule calling for a realistic approach to tax situations. As so broad and unchallenged a principle furnishes only a general direction, it is of little value in the solution of tax problems."). The substance over form analysis, rather, is a distinct and limited exception to the general rule under Moline Properties that separate entities must be respected as such for tax purposes. The substance over form doctrine applies to disregard the separate corporate entity where "Congress has evinced an intent to the contrary. . . ." Clougherty, 811 F.2d at 1302. As the Court stated in Le Gierse, 319 U.S. at 439, "A particular legislative purpose, such as the development of the merchant marine, . . . may call for the disregarding of the separate entity, Munson S.S. Line v. Commissioner, 77 F.2d 849, as may the necessity of striking down frauds on the tax statute, Continental Oil v. Jones, 113 F.2d 557." However, as the Ninth Circuit pointed out in Clougherty, "Congress . . . has remained silent with respect to the taxation of captive insurers. . . ." 811 F.2d at 1302. In general, absent specific congressional intent to the contrary, as is the situation in this case, a court cannot disregard a transaction in the name of economic reality and substance over form absent a finding of sham or lack of business purpose under the relevant tax statute. Clougherty, 811 F.2d at 1302; Gregory v. Helvering, 239 U.S. 465, 469 (1935); Higgins v. Smith, 308 U.S. 473, 477 (1940).
In the instant case, the tax court found that Humana had a valid business purpose for incorporating Health Care Indemnity. Congress has manifested no intent to disregard the separate corporate entity in the context of captive insurers. In short, the substance over form or economic reality argument under current legal application does not provide any justification for the tax court to reclassify the insurance premiums paid by the subsidiaries of Humana Inc. as nondeductible additions to a reserve for losses. The test to determine whether a transaction under the Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954) is legitimate or illegitimate is not a vague and broad "economic reality" test. The test is whether there is risk shifting and risk distribution. Only if a transaction fails to meet the above two-pronged test can the court justifiably RECLASSIFY the transaction as something other than insurance.
We have both risk shifting and risk distribution involved in the transactions between the Humana subsidiaries and Health Care Indemnity. The transactions between Health Care Indemnity and the separate affiliates of Humana, therefore, are properly within the statutory language of the Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954) as interpreted in Le Gierse. As long as the transactions meet the purposes of the tax statute, Higgins, 308 U.S. at 477, the substance of the transactions are valid and legitimate regardless of its form and regardless of the tax motivation on the part of the taxpayers involved, Gregory, 293 U.S. at 469.
We, therefore, find no credence in the distinction between disregarding the particular transactions between the Humana affiliates and Health Care Indemnity and disregarding the separate entities. Absent a fact pattern of sham or lack of business purpose, a court should accept transactions between related though separate corporations as proper and not disregard them because of the relationship between the parties. As the Second Circuit stated in Kraft Foods Company v. Commissioner, 232 F.2d 118, 123-24 (2nd Cir. 1956):
[I]t is one thing to say that transactions between affiliates should be carefully scrutinized and sham transactions disregarded, and quite a different thing to say that a genuine transaction affecting legal relations should be disregarded for tax purposes merely because it is a transaction between affiliated corporations. We think that to strike down a genuine transaction because of a parent's subsidiary relation would violate the scheme of the statute and depart from the rules of law heretofore governing intercompany transactions.
Id. 123-24.
Finally, the tax court argues that if it did not deny the deductions in the brother-sister context, Humana Inc. could avoid the tax court's holding on issue one, the parent-captive issue, that insurance premiums paid by the parent to a captive insurance company are not deductible and accomplish the same purpose through its subsidiaries. Such an argument provides no LEGAL justification for denying the deduction in the brother- sister context. The legal test is whether there has been risk distribution and risk shifting, not whether Humana Inc. is a common parent or whether its affiliates are in a brother-sister relationship to Health Care Indemnity. We do not focus on the relationship of the parties per se or the particular structure of the corporation involved. We look to the assets of the insured. Clougherty, 811 F.2d at 1305. If Humana changes its corporate structure and that change involves risk shifting and risk distribution, and that change is for a legitimate business purpose and is not a sham to avoid the payment of taxes, then it is irrelevant whether the changed corporate structure has the side effect of also permitting Humana Inc.'s affiliates to take advantage of the Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954) and deduct payments to a captive insurance company under the control of the Humana parent as insurance premiums.
The Commissioner argues for us to adopt its economic family approach because this approach recognizes the economic reality of the transaction between Humana affiliates and the captive insurance company, Health Care Indemnity. We do not, however, as the government argues, look to Humana Inc., the parent, to determine whether premiums paid by the affiliates to Health Care Indemnity are deductible. To do so would be to treat Humana Inc., its affiliates and Health Care Indemnity as one "economic unit" and ignore the reality of their separate corporate existence for tax purposes in violation of Moline Properties. Even the tax court explictly rejected the Commissioner's economic family argument. Humana, 88 T.C. at 230. /3/
The Commissioner has also argued that even if we do not adopt the economic family argument, we should look through the form of the transaction between the Humana affiliates and Health Care Indemnity to the substance of the transaction and hold that in substance there was no risk shifting. It would appear that this is just another way of stating that transactions between affiliates for tax purposes shall be disregarded if devoid of business purposes or a sham. We have already discussed in detail this exception to Moline Properties, supra. However, if the Commissioner's form over substance or "economic reality" argument is an attempt to broaden the "sham" exception or fashion a new exception, we reject the argument.
B. RISK DISTRIBUTION
Treating the Humana affiliates and Health Care Indemnity as separate entities and rejecting the economic family argument leads to the conclusion that the first prong of the Le Gierse test for determining "insurance" has been met -- there is risk shifting between the Humana affiliates and Health Care Indemnity. However, we must also satisfy the second prong of Le Gierse and find risk distribution. As stated, supra, risk distribution involves shifting to a group of individuals the identified risk of the insured. The focus is broader and looks more to the insurer as to whether the risk insured against can be distributed over a larger group rather than the relationship between the insurer and any single insured. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Treganowan, 183 F.2d 288, 291 (2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 853 (1950). There is little authority adequately discussing what constitutes risk distribution if there is risk shifting. Just recently, the tax court in Gulf Oil v. Commissioner, 89 T.C. 1010, 1035 (1987), noted that insurance must consist of both risk shifting and risk distribution and that the definition of an insurance contract depended on meeting both of the prongs. /4/ With this we firmly agree. Risk transfer and risk distribution are two separate and distinct prongs of the test and both must be met to create an insurance contract. An arrangement between a parent corporation and a captive insurance company in which the captive insures only the risks of the parent might not result in risk distribution. Any loss by the parent is not subject to the premiums of any other entity. However, we see no reason why there would not be risk distribution in the instant case where the captive insures several separate corporations within an affiliated group and losses can be spread among the several distinct corporate entities.
III.
In conclusion, we affirm the tax court on issue one, the parent- subsidiary issue. The contracts between Humana, Inc., the parent, and Health Care Indemnity, the wholly owned captive insurance company, are not insurance contracts and the premiums are not deductible under the Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954). We reverse the tax court on issue two, the brother-sister issue. The contracts between the affiliates of Humana Inc. and Health Care Indemnity are in substance insurance contracts and the premiums are deductible. Under Moline Properties, we must recognize the affiliates as separate and distinct corporations from Humana Inc., the parent company, and, as such, they shifted their risk to Health Care Indemnity. Furthermore, we find there was risk distribution on the part of Health Care Indemnity given the number of separate though related corporations insured by Health Care Indemnity. Under no circumstances do we adopt the economic family argument advanced by the government.
Thus the Tax Court is affirmed on Issue One, Reversed on Issue Two and the case remanded for recomputation of the tax due.
FOOTNOTES
* The Honorable Barbara K. Hackett, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.
/1/ Humana Incorporated owns 75% of Health Care Indemnity and Human's Netherland affiliate owns 25%. Technically, therefore, Humana is not a 100% owner of Health Care Indemnity. However, the tax court stated, and both parties agreed, that the only business purpose of the offshore affiliate was to provide capital for Health Care Indemnity. Therefore, the court and both parties agreed to treat Health Care Indemnity as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana.
/2/ The Carnation case involved an undercapitalized foreign captive, with a capitalization agreement running to the captive from the parent. Stearns-Roger, although involving an adequately capitalized domestic captive, involved an indemnification agreement running from the parent to the captive. A third case, Beech Aircraft 797 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1986), mentioned as support for the majority position, also involved an undercapitalized captive. These weaknesses alone provided a sufficient basis from which to find no risk shifting and to decide the cases in favor of the Commissioner. The Humana case contained no such indemnification agreement and Health Care Indemnity was adequately capitalized.
/3/ Although the tax court in the present case disclaims reliance on the economic family theory, its holding appears ultimately premised on the same type of analysis. In effect the tax court holds that one corporate entity cannot shift risk of loss in an insurance transaction to another corporate entity if they are in the same affiliated group. This approach conflicts with the Moline Properties rule of separate corporate entities. As the eight member concurrence written by Judge Whitaker pointed out:
However, the majority refers repeatedly with apparent approval to decisions of other courts, including the opinion of the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit affirming our opinion in Carnation, all of which follow Carnation and adopt the economic family concept. The majority also quotes extensively with approval from the testimony of respondent's experts, Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart, who have fully swallowed respondent's economic family concept. . . . For these reasons, I strongly believe that we should decide the issue solely on a lack of risk shifting and risk distribution basis.
Humana, 88 T.C. 197, 231 (1987) (Whitaker, J., concurring).
It is this argument that we consider more logically sound than the majority. We disagree, however, in the application of the argument and find the existence of risk shifting and risk distribution.
/4/ The tax court noted in Gulf Oil, decided shortly after this Humana case, that if a captive insurance company insured unrelated interests outside the affiliated group of the captive insurance company, then there might be adequate risk transfer created by insuring the risks of independent third parties. The majority held that the addition of 2% of unrelated premiums is de minimis and would not satisfy the majority that the risk was transferred. However, if the premium income from unrelated parties was at least 50%, the majority stated that there would be sufficient risk transfer so that the arrangement would constitute insurance and premiums paid by the parent and affiliates to the captive insurance company would be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code section 162(a) (1954). It is unclear in the language employed by the tax court majority in Gulf Oil whether the appearance of unrelated third-party premiums constitutes risk shifting or risk distribution. The tax court majority refers to the appearance of unrelated third-parties as sufficient to constitute "risk transfer." If the appearance of unrelated third- parties creates "risk transfer" and by this the tax court means both risk shifting and risk distribution, the tax court majority ignores the fact that risk shifting and risk distribution are two separate and distinct prongs. The tax court majority cannot collapse the two prong test into one and claim that the appearance of unrelated third- parties creates enough risk transfer. Such is not the law. If the presence of unrelated third-parties goes to the question of risk distribution, then the tax court majority should never have reached that issue as its prior opinions, especially its opinion in Humana, stated that there can be no risk shifting as between a captive insurance company and a parent and its affiliated corporations where both are owned by a common parent, as was the situation in Gulf Oil. Thus the tax court has created its own conflict between its holding in Humana and its holding in Gulf.

Judge: Goffe, opinion Whitaker, concurring opinion Hamblen, concurring opinion Korner, dissenting in part
Docket No. 17130-82. /1/
Filed January 26, 1987.
Humana Inc. and its wholly owned foreign subsidiary own all of the capital stock of a captive insurance subsidiary incorporated by the parent corporation. The parent corporation paid to the captive insurance subsidiary amounts which were treated as premiums for insurance coverage of the parent and subsidiaries. The parent allocated and charged to the subsidiaries portions of the amounts paid representing the share each bore for the hospitals each operated. The remainder represents the parent's share for the hospitals which it operated. The total sums were deducted on the consolidated income tax returns as insurance premiums. Held, the risks of loss were not shifted from petitioner and its subsidiaries and the amounts paid to the captive insurance subsidiary are not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses for insurance. Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 948 (1985), and Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, 71 T.C. 400 (1978), affd. 640 F.2d 1010 (9th Cir. 1981), followed and extended; Stearns- Roger Corp. v.

After concessions by the parties, one issue remains for our decision, i.e., to what extent, if any, may petitioner deduct as ordinary and necessary business expenses amounts paid to a wholly owned captive insurance company which were treated as premiums for general liability and medical malpractice insurance.
We first decided the case in Memorandum Opinion, T. C. Memo. 1985-426. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the opinion pursuant to Rule 161. /2/ The Court granted the motion and withdrew the opinion.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Some of the facts have been stipulated and are so found. The stipulations of facts and attached exhibits are hereby incorporated by reference.
Humana Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on July 27, 1964. At all pertinent times, the stock of Humana Inc. was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and its principal place of business was in Louisville, Kentucky.
Humana Inc. is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that filed consolidated Federal income tax returns for the taxable years ended August 31, 1976, through August 31, 1979, inclusive, with the Internal Revenue Service Center at Memphis, Tennessee. The parent and subsidiary corporations which filed the consolidated returns will sometimes be referred to collectively as "petitioner."
American Medicorp, Inc. (AMI), was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on January 11, 1968. It was primarily engaged in the business of operating general, acute care community hospitals offering a wide range of medical, surgical, and related services. On February 2, 1978, Humana Inc. acquired 53.4 percent of the common stock of AMI for $85.5 million and 2,849,567 shares of Humana Inc. preferred stock. On September 27, 1978, AMI merged with and into Humana Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana Inc. that was incorporated for purposes of the merger. As a result of the merger, Humana Inc. became the owner of all of the outstanding common stock of AMI. The final short period taxable year of AMI ended on September 27, 1978. AMI was merged into Humana Inc. on December 21, 1978.
As of February 1978, AMI held two general liability insurance policies. The primary policy was provided by American Home Assurance Company (American Home), and an excess layer of insurance was provided by an industry pooling arrangement known as Hospital Underwriting Group, Inc. (HUG).
As of November 1976, petitioner operated 62 hospitals in 16 states and one foreign country, containing 8,586 beds. As of 1979, principally as a result of its acquisition of AMI, petitioner operated 92 hospitals in 23 states and one foreign country, containing 16,529 beds. Petitioner currently operates 87 hospitals owned by 36 corporations.
From 1972 until August 31, 1976, Continental Insurance Company (Continental) provided petitioner with general liability insurance, including malpractice liability and workers' compensation insurance. As early as 1973, however, there were signs that the availability of such coverage to hospitals was diminishing, and by the mid-1970's, this lack of availability became severe because of the long interval between setting the premium rate, collecting the premiums, and settling claims. During the intervals, loss reserves are established by use of actuarial accounting. Errors in such loss reserves have a strong impact on capital and earnings. Due to changing rules, economic inflation and misjudgments, insurers were adjusting their loss reserves and premiums in many lines of casualty insurance, including malpractice insurance. On May 7, 1976, Continental advised petitioner by letter that it would be unable to renew its insurance coverage when it expired on August 31, 1976.
Through the services of its insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan, Inc. (Marsh & McLennan), Humana Inc. attempted to obtain general and professional liability insurance from third-party insurers, but was unsuccessful. On June 1, 1976, Marsh & McLennan recommended that petitioner immediately take steps to establish a captive insurance company.
At the time that the Marsh & McLennan letter was received, petitioner was considering the following options:
(1) going uninsured;
(2) creating a trust fund or reserve for self-insurance;
(3) combining with other hospital companies in a 5-year insurance pooling arrangement; or
(4) establishing a captive insurance company.
Petitioner rejected Option (1) because it concluded that it was not strong enough to sustain the burden of catastrophic risk if it went uninsured. It rejected Option (2) because, first, it felt that this option would not allow it access to commercial insurance markets for certain excess protection which it regarded as essential; second, some 40 percent of its business was under Medicare and Medicaid, and at least the former would not permit reimbursement for additions to the reserves; /3/ and third, it was clear that payments into such a reserve fund would not be deductible for Federal income tax purposes. Petitioner rejected Option (3) because, first, it had doubts about the financial viability of its potential affiliates in such a pooling arrangement; second, one such potential affiliate owned hospitals in what were regarded as the worst states for malpractice claims; and third, it was reluctant to bind itself to such an arrangement for a 5year period. Option (4) was considered the most attractive because it possessed none of the perceived disadvantages associated with the other options and it would provide a regulated method of insuring risks which would both isolate funds for the settlement of claims and satisfy interested lenders, mortgagees, and securities analysts. In addition, Option (4) would provide access to world reinsurance and excess insurance markets.
On July 14, 1976, petitioner sought the approval of the Insurance Department of Colorado to establish a captive insurance company under Colorado law to insure against losses due to fire, general liability, medical malpractice, including hospitals, and other casualties.
On August 5, 1976, Health Care Indemnity, Inc. (HCI), was incorporated under the Colorado Corporation Act. The articles of incorporation of HCI state the following purposes for its incorporation: /4/ to conduct, engage in and carry on the business of making all kinds of insurance and reinsurance authorized to be made under the Colorado Captive Insurance Company Act * * * and to conduct, engage in and carry on all other activities incident to conducting such insurance and reinsurance business.
From August 20, 1976, to October 12, 1982, HCI qualified as a captive insurance company under Colorado law.
Humana Holdings, N.V. (HHNV), is a Netherlands Antilles corporation organized and incorporated on August 4, 1976. Humana Inc. purchased all of the capital stock of HHNV for $250,000, and continues to own it. The only business purpose for HHNV was to assist in the capitalization of HCI. Petitioner used the device of HHNV because it concluded that to do otherwise would have required the consolidation of HCI and Humana Inc. for tax purposes, requiring Humana Inc. to abandon its fiscal year in favor of a calendar year.
At the time of the initial capitalization of HCI, 150,000 shares of preferred stock and 250,000 shares of common stock were issued. Of these, HHNV purchased the preferred stock for $250,000 in cash, which it still owns, and Humana Inc. purchased the common stock for $750,000, paid in irrevocable letters of credit issued in favor of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Colorado. At all times since such capitalization, each share of common stock of HCI has been entitled to five votes and each preferred share to one vote.
There were no agreements between HCI and Humana Inc. or its subsidiaries which would require the latter to contribute additional capital to HCI for the payment of any losses. However, on May 31, 1979, Humana Inc. contributed $1,323,000 to the capital of HCI. This represented a refund paid by HUG to Humana Inc. after AMI merged with Humana Subsidiary, Inc.
HCI issued the following policies during the taxable years in issue, identifying Humana Inc. and affiliated and subsidiary corporations, in the numbers shown, as named insureds:
Policy No. Policy period Coverage
From To No. of No. of corporations hospitals
1001 9/1/76 8/31/77 22 64
1003 9/1/77 /5/ 9/1/78 22 59
HCI-90178 9/1/78 9/1/79 48 97
In addition, policy number HCI-60178, was effective from June 1, 1978, at which time Humana Inc. owned 53.4 percent of AMI's common stock, until June 1, 1979. HCI replaced AMI's primary policy with American Home, and incorporated by reference the terms of AMI's excess coverage under its policy with HUG.
The charges for the foregoing policies accrued ratably throughout the policy periods. During the taxable years in issue, the following amounts were paid by petitioner to HCI for such policies and were deducted on the consolidated Federal income tax returns:

Total
$21,055,575
The foregoing charges were developed by Marsh & McLennan pursuant to standard industry practice generally by applying to the average number of occupied beds, a composite rate developed by a rating organization known as Insurance Service Offices. The resulting amounts were billed by HCI to Humana Inc. on a monthly basis and were paid by Humana Inc. in a single payment representing the total premiums for all of the hospitals. Later, by means of an allocation formula, portions of the foregoing amounts were charged to the subsidiaries.
/10/ Each of the policies provided three types of coverage: Coverage A--personal injury; Coverage B--property damage; and Coverage C-- professional liability, including personal injury relating to certain professional services (i.e., malpractice). Each policy also included a "good samaritan endorsement" under which professional employees, acting outside of their capacity as employees, were covered for certain occasional professional services not rendered for their personal benefit.
Under each of the four policies, the following were considered as "an insured:"
a. The named insured;
b. Any officer, hospital administrator * * *, stockholder, or member of the Board of * * * Directors or Governors of the named insured while acting for * * * the named insured.
c. Under Coverages A and B, any employee, student or volunteer worker of the named insured while acting within the scope of his duties * * *;
* * *
f. Under Coverage C, any person included in any of the employee classifications for which coverage is afforded under this policy, as indicated in Item 5 of the Declarations, while such person is acting within the scope of his duties as an employee * * *.
Pursuant to Item 5 of the Declarations, any employee of the insured was covered, including those professional employees who were licensed residents, interns, physicians, surgeons, or dentists, except that physicians, surgeons, and dentists were excluded under policy number HCI-60178. Under such policy, however, coverage was extended to independent contractors licensed as physicians and practicing in the hospital emergency room or attending to emergencies on the hospital premises. After June 1, 1979, this coverage was also provided for those insured under policy number HCI-90178. Generally, no coverage was provided for non-employee physicians, since they carried their own insurance.
Humana Inc., on forms 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the taxable years in issue, described the coverage provided by HCI as follows: The Insurance Subsidiary will insure the risks of the Company only, and it will only provide insurance to physicians who are actually employed by the Company. In such documents, "Company" is defined as Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries.
At all times pertinent in this case, payments for coverage of each of the categories described above were paid by petitioner and were not charged to the employee or other individual involved.
Pursuant to policies numbered 1001, 1003, and HCI-90178, the liability of HCI was limited to $2 million per occurrence under Coverages A, B, and C, $2 million in the aggregate under Coverages A and B, and $10 million in the aggregate under Coverage C. /11/ Pursuant to policy number HCI-60178, the liability of HCI was limited to $500,000 per occurrence and $2.4 million in the aggregate for each category of covered risks.
The insurance coverage of petitioner during the taxable years in issue also included multiple layers of excess coverage placed with third-party insurance carriers, over and above the foregoing primary layer provided by HCI.
In policies numbered 1002 and 1004, HCI also provided certain excess comprehensive general coverage to petitioner for the respective periods September 1, 1976, to August 31, 1977, and September 1, 1977, to August 31, 1978. All of the liability under these policies was reinsured by HCI with third-party reinsurance companies. The Commissioner allowed petitioner to deduct the premiums for these policies. With the exception of these policies, during the taxable years in issue HCI did not reinsure the risks of losses with other insurance companies nor did petitioner obtain policies with third-party insurers which were reinsured by or with HCI.
At all times involved in this case HCI filed separate Federal income tax returns based upon a calendar year. The returns and its books and records were maintained using the accrual method of accounting.
During the taxable years in issue, HCI had no employees other than its officers, most of whom were also officers of Humana Inc. By contract dated August 1976, Marsh & McLennan provided HCI with resident managing officers and a variety of administrative and management services, including consulting, underwriting, risk control, recordkeeping, and accounting services. At all times involved in this case, Underwriters Adjusting Co. provided, by written contract, claims administration and claims service for HCI.
After concessions, the sole issue for decision is whether the following amounts are deductible as insurance premiums:

OPINION
We previously decided this case in Memorandum Opinion, T. C. Memo. 1985-426. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court granted, and the Court withdrew the opinion.
Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries operated hospitals whose insurance coverage was cancelled. Humana Inc. incorporated a captive insurance subsidiary which it jointly owned with a wholly owned foreign subsidiary. The captive insurance subsidiary purported to provide insurance coverage for Humana Inc. and its other subsidiaries. Humana Inc. paid to the captive insurance subsidiary amounts which it treated as insurance premiums. It charged portions of these amounts to its operating subsidiaries.
Two issues are presented for our decision:
1. Are the sums paid to HCI by Humana Inc. on its own behalf deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses for insurance premiums and
2. Are the sums charged by Humana Inc. to the operating subsidiaries deductible on the consolidated income tax returns as ordinary and necessary business expenses for insurance premiums.
For convenience the first issue may be described as the "parent- subsidiary" issue and the second issue may be described as the "brother-sister" issue. These represent the relationships between the entity which purports to be the insured and the captive insurance subsidiary which purports to be the insurer.
We have previously decided the parent-subsidiary issue in Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, 71 T.C. 400 (1978), affd. 640 F.2d 1010 (9th Cir. 1981), and Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 948 (1985), on appeal (9th Cir., Dec. 13, 1985). Our decision in Carnation has been followed in disallowing the deductions in Beech Aircraft Corp. v. United States, 797 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1986), Stearns-Roger Corp. v. United States, 774 F.2d 414 (10th Cir. 1985), and Mobil Oil Corp. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 555 (1985). Carnation was applied, but with a different result, in Crawford Fitting Co. v. United States, 606 F. Supp. 136 (N.D. Ohio 1985). Our decision in Clougherty has been followed in Anesthesia Service Medical Group v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. 1031 (1985), on appeal (9th Cir., May 14, 1986), Stearns-Roger, and Mobil. Accordingly, we decide the parent- subsidiary issue in favor of respondent under the authority of Carnation and Clougherty, and it is unnecessary to restate our analysis.
Petitioner also contends that even if the subject payments failed to constitute deductible insurance premiums, they are nonetheless deductible under section 162 "because they are 'ordinary and necessary' business expenses 'paid or incurred' during the taxable years" in issue. In Clougherty we answered this argument by holding that in disallowing the payments as insurance premiums we reclassified them as nondeductible. 84 T.C. at 960. The Claims Court in Mobil followed this approach. 8 Cl. Ct. at 567.
Payments to a captive insurance company are equivalent to additions to a reserve for losses. Stearns-Roger Corp. v. United States, supra at 415; Mobil Oil Corp. v. United States, supra at 567. It has long been recognized that sums set aside as an insurance reserve are not deductible. Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. United States, 577 F.2d 279, 280 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 946 (1979); Spring Canyon Coal v. Commissioner, 43 F.2d 78 (10th Cir. 1930), cert. denied 284 U.S. 654 (1931). If the payments to HCI are not deductible as insurance premiums, they are not deductible at all.
In addition, petitioner argues for deductibility of portions of the amounts paid by Humana Inc. to HCI. It contends that the expense of providing insurance to certain employees, officers, directors, and contractors covered under the policies in issue should be deductible. As to this argument, petitioner cites no authority to support its apparent contention that the risks, whether arising from purely corporate acts or acts of specific corporate employees, were other than the risks fully retained within the meaning of Carnation and Clougherty. Indeed, we believe that it would be difficult to find any such persuasive authority where, as here, the coverage of certain employees, officers, and others was clearly an integral part of the protection of the parent corporation. In this regard, on its forms 10-K filed by Humana Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the taxable years in issue, it described the coverage provided by HCI as follows: The Insurance Subsidiary will insure the risks of the Company only, and it will only provide insurance to physicians who are actually employed by the Company. In such documents, "Company" is defined as Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries.
We turn now to the brother-sister issue, which is an issue of first impression in this Court. It has, however, been decided in favor of the government in Stearns-Roger and Mobil. Those cases extended the rationale of Carnation and Clougherty to the brother- sister factual pattern. We likewise extend the rationale to the brother-sister factual pattern of the instant case. We emphasize that our holding is based upon the factual pattern presented in this case. We recognize that corporate factual patterns may differ. See Crawford Fitting Co. v. United States, supra. In addition, other factors may be present, e.g., reinsurance agreements, guarantees, etc.
Petitioner, in support of its motion for reconsideration argues that in the Mobil case it has support for holding that the risk was shifted among the subsidiaries. We disagree. Mobil involved not only the deductibility of payments from the parent and the subsidiaries to the captive insurance subsidiary but also whether the payments from the subsidiaries to the captive insurance subsidiary resulted in constructive dividends to the parent. The Claims Court held that the arrangement did not cause the risk of loss to be shifted and the payments were, therefore, not deductible as insurance premiums. It also held that the payments did not result in constructive dividends to the parent. 8 Cl. Ct. at 568.
Petitioner relies upon the portion of the Claims Court opinion concerning constructive dividends in which the Court describes the business purposes involved. The business purpose for the payments is not relevant in deciding the deductibility of the payments as insurance premiums because the payments have been reclassified as nondeductible additions to a reserve for losses.
This is the first case on captive insurance arrangements in which expert testimony has been presented to this Court. Carnation was decided on the parties' motions for summary judgment and Clougherty was fully stipulated. In the instant case three expert witnesses testified and the Court received written reports of their opinions. Dr. Irving Pfeffer testified for petitioner and Dr. Irving Plotkin and Mr. Richard Edward Stewart testified on behalf of respondent. Dr. Plotkin testified in the Stearns-Roger, Beech Aircraft, and Mobil cases cited above. Dr. Pfeffer and Mr. Stewart did not testify in any of the previously decided cases.
The opinion of Dr. Pfeffer provides little reasoning and is not very convincing. It simply concludes that the arrangements between Humana Inc., its operating subsidiaries, and HCI constitute insurance. Furthermore, it is contrary to the cases cited above.
Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart prepared a joint opinion. Their opinion is consistent with our decisions in Carnation and Clougherty and contains very persuasive reasoning. The analysis portion of the Plotkin- Stewart expert report is as follows:
Analysis
This case presents the question of whether payments made by a corporation to its wholly owned subsidiary in exchange for formal contracts of "insurance" constitute deductible premiums for federal income tax purposes. The respondent has taken the position that such transactions are not deductible since they are devoid of any RISK TRANSFER (also referred to as risk shifting), an element which he believes to be critical to the definition of insurance for federal income tax purposes.
The respondent has requested us to analyze whether or not the various transactions between and among Humana, AMI, HCI, and * * *, labeled "insurance" by te petitioner, can actually be considered "insurance" from the standpoint of how the insurance and economic professions view them.
Commercial insurance is a mechanism for transferring the financial uncertainty arising from pure risks faced by one firm to another in exchange for an insurance premium. Such financial uncertainty is caused by the possibility of certain types of occurrences that may have only adverse financial consequences. A corporation such as Humana that places its risks in a captive insurance company that it owns, either directly or through a parent corporation, subsidiary, or a fronting company, is not relieving itself of this financial uncertainty. The reason for this is simply that such corporation, through its ownership position, still holds the benefits and burdens of retaining the financial consequences of its own risks. It has a dollar for dollar economic interest in the result of any "insured" peril.
A term frequently used for the act of insuring is underwriting. An essential element of the concept of underwriting is the transference of uncertainty from one firm to another, generally from the one whose activities naturally give rise to the uncertainty to one whose investors are in the business of accepting such uncertainty for the potential profit they can earn thereby.
Thus, insurers, and the interests that own them, are risk takers. They assume the financial consequences of the risks for others in return for a premium payment. * * *
The essential element of an insurance transaction from the standpoint of the insured (e.g., Humana and its hospital network), is that no matter what insured perils occur, the financial consequences are known in advance. Thus the insured, for the price of its premium, is protected from such financial consequences, within the limits of its policy. By reason of its contract, the insured is indemnified against loss from a defined hazard or risk. In essence, the premium represents the substitution of a small, but certain "loss", for a potentially large and uncertain loss,
To have a true transfer of risk, another risk-bearer must replace the insured. To speak of a transfer of risk to a fund or reserve established by the insured is merely to describe "self- insurance". A captive insurance subsidiary, such as HCI, represents a recognized form of risk retention or "self- insurance". Many scholars have noted that the very term, "self- insurance", is a misnomer, since there cannot be any insurance without risk transfer.
Accordingly, a firm cannot insure itself. This does not mean, however, that a firm cannot or should not choose to retain the financial uncertainty of the hazards it faces, nor attempt to predict and minimize the financial consequences of its risks. Whether its portfolio of risks is large or small, there is always uncertainty concerning what will be the actual financial consequences of the events that may occur during some future time period. In fact, the larger the collection of risks, the greater is the uncertainty concerning the actual result. The only way a firm can relieve itself but only of the financial uncertainty is by entering into a contract whereby some other firm will assume that uncertainty. * * *
A firm placing its risks in a captive insurance company in which it holds a sole or predominant /12/ ownership position, is not relieving itself of financial uncertainty. It is, through its ownership, retaining-the burdens and benefits of assuming the financial responsibility of its own risks. This concept has been recognized by scholars for at least twenty years:
It is apparent that the nature of the captive- insurance device involves not only the element of insurance through "transfer" of risks, but also the notion of self- insurance since the "owners" of the risks insured therein are the "owners" of the insurer. The fortunes of the two entities are interlocked to the extent that the risks insured in the captive are not reinsured. In this sense, captive insuring can be considered a risk- retention device similar to self-insurance. In fact, if self-insurance involves the conduct of risk managment "according to all the sound principles and practices employed by insurance companies" it might be argued that captive insuring is the epitome of the self-insurance device. . . (Robert S. Goshay, "Captive Insurance Companies," Risk Management, Ch. VI, Richard D. Irwin, Inc., Homewood, Illinois, 1964, pp. 80-121, at p. 85.)
* * * [T]he recognition and description of captive insurance as a form of risk retention and self-insurance permeates the theoretical and applied insurance and accounting literature. * * *
When a firm actually obtains insurance, the firm's financial costs associated with the insured peril are independent of whether or not the peril actually comes to pass, or the extent of the financial damage caused by the peril. Its costs, in fact, are equal to the insurance premium and KNOWN IN ADVANCE WITH CERTAINTY. Just the opposite obtains with any form of self-insurance, be it on the corporation's books or through the books of the firm's captive insurance subsidiary. The actual costs are a direct, dollar-for-dollar function of what perils in fact come to pass and what their financial consequences turn out to be.
* * *
A question that perplexes some when initially confronted with the captive insurance area is whether or not respondent has chosen to treat, either directly or indirectly, two separate legal entities as one single economic unit. One's first impression might be that, since a parent corporation can deal at arm's-length with a subsidiary in other areas besides insurance and have such transactions respected by respondent, "insurance premiums" paid to a captive should not be treated any differently. The answer to this paradox lies in the unique nature of insurance transactions relative to other types of parent/ subsidiary transactions.
True insurance relieves the firm's balance sheet of any potential impact of the financial consequences of the insured peril. For the price of the premiums, the insured rids itself of any economic stake in whether or not the loss occurs. * * * [However] as long as the firm deals with its captive, its balance sheet cannot be protected from the financial vicissitudes of the insured peril. /13/
On the other hand, if a parent sold its subsidiary a hotel, it is true that the ultimate fate of that hotel will be reflected on the balance sheet. However, whether or not the transferred property could accurately, for tax and other purposes, be described as a hotel is not a function of whether or not the parent's balance sheet reflects the ultimate fate of the property. This, however, is precisely opposite from the case of insurance. A transaction can be fairly described as insurance if, and only if, the parent's balance sheet is immunized from the financial consequences of the insured peril. * * *
It is well recognized that insurance premiums are accorded unique and favorable treatment within the Internal Revenue Code. The same is true for other specific economic activities, such as the depletion allowance accorded to oil wells. We believe that if company A sold company B a farm but in the contract described it as an oil well, company B would not be eligible for depletion allowances.
* * *
CONCLUSION
So long as the firm does not transfer to another the ultimate responsibility for the financial consequences of its risks, it remains the risk bearer and faces the uncertainty of each year's actual financial losses. The attempted placing of a firm's risks, directly or indirectly, in its "insurance affiliates" did not accomplish a transference of risk, or constitute an insurance transaction as a matter of insurance theory or economic reality. We find our conclusion in complete accord with the clear theoretical and applied teachings of the economics, insurance theory, risk management, and captive self- insurance literatures.
In Beech Aircraft, the District Court commented favorably on the testimony of Dr. Plotkin, found it to be relevant, and overruled the taxpayer's objections to the testimony. /14/ No court has refused to accept the testimony of Dr. Plotkin on captive insurance.
Dr. Plotkin testified in both of the brother-sister cases. The District Court, in Stearns-Roger, adopted the analysis of Dr. Plotkin. The Claims Court, in Mobil, based upon the opinion of Dr. Plotkin, concluded that the risk of loss was always with the parent corporation and was not shifted away from the parent by reason of payments among the brother-sister subsidiaries. The Claims Court commented upon the testimony of Dr. Plotkin as follows:
Dr. Irvin Plotkin, * * * was qualified as an expert in the economics of insurance. Dr. Plotkin testified that Mobil did not actually purchase insurance as the term is defined in the field of economics. Essentially, Dr. Plotkin testified that a wholly- owned subsidiary cannot insure its parent because there is no risk transference. The risk of loss remains within the economic unit. As a shareholder of a wholly-owned insurance affiliate, the parent company bears the risks of the subsidiary, suffers from losses sustained by the subsidiary, and benefits from gains realized by the subsidiary. * * * [8 Cl. Ct. at 563.]
Mr. Stewart, in his testimony in the instant case, agreed with Dr. Plotkin as to the shifting of risk. Mr. Stewart has imposing credentials, among them he was superintendent of insurance for the State of New York from 1967 through 1970. From a pragmatic standpoint he perceived no difference between the payments at issue and self insurance.
The joint opinion of Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart proceeds from the proposition that there must be a transfer or shifting of risk for the transactions to represent insurance. This conforms to "hornbook law" that a taxpayer cannot deduct as insurance premiums amounts set aside in its own possession to compensate itself for perils which are generally the subject of insurance. Stearns-Roger Corp. v. United States, 774 F.2d at 416; Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, 640 F.2d at 1013; Mobil Oil Corp. Commissioner, 8 Cl. Ct. at 566; Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. at 958; Pan-American Hide Co. v. Commissioner, 1 B.T.A. 1249, 1250 (1925). Thus, a taxpayer cannot deduct as insurance premiums amounts which it sets aside as a reserve to cover future casualties.
If we decline to extend our holdings in Carnation and Clougherty to the brother-sister factual pattern, we would exalt form over substance and permit a taxpayer to circumvent our holdings by simple corporate structural changes. Assume that Corporation A incorporates a wholly owned captive insurance company, Corporation B, which insures the risks of A. Under our holdings in Carnation and Clougherty, A could not deduct the premiums it pays to B.
Let us alter the corporate structures to the brother-sister factual pattern. The shareholders of Corporation A exchange their stock for the stock of Corporation B, which was incorporated for the sole purpose of holding the stock of A. A is now the wholly owned subsidiary of B. A continues to be the operating corporation. B then incorporates a wholly owned captive insurance company, Corporation C. Corporation C insures the risks of Corporation A, the operating company. Corporations A and C are brother-sister corporations of a common parent, Corporation B.
If we do not extend the holdings of Carnation and Clougherty to the brother-sister factual pattern, the payments from Corporation A to Corporation C would be deductible as insurance premiums. Such a holding, of course, would be contrary to the decisions of the Tenth Circuit in Stearns-Roger and the Claims Court in Mobil, both of whom relied upon our decisions in Carnation and Clougherty.
Respondent again argues that we should adopt his "economic family" concept which he articulated in Rev. Rul. 77-316, 1977-2 C.B. 53. We declined to adopt that concept in Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, 71
T.C. at 413, and also declined to adopt it in Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. at 956. We again decline to adopt that concept because it does not tell all of the story. As we have seen from Crawford Fitting an "economic family" may exist which results in the shifting of risk. Instead of applying a broad approach such as "economic family" to captive insurance, we hold that it is more appropriate to examine all of the facts to decide whether or to what extent there has been a shifting of the risk from one entity to the captive insurance company.
We conclude that there was not the necessary shifting of risk from the operating subsidiaries of Humana Inc. to HCI and, therefore, the amounts charged by Humana Inc. to its subsidiaries did not constitute insurance. Accordingly, the amounts paid to HCI are not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses.
Decisions will be entered under Rule 155.

FOOTNOTES TO OPINION
/1/ The cases were consolidated for trial, briefing and opinion.
/2/ All Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure and all section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and applicable to the taxable years in issue.
/3/ Prior to 1976, petitioner's insurance premiums were apparently considered an allowable cost for Medicare coverage, viz, Medicare would reimburse hospitals for the pro rata cost of certain expenditures, including insurance, for services provided to Medicare patients.
/4/ This excerpt is from the original articles filed on August 5, 1976, rather than the restated articles filed on December 24, 1981.
/5/ While the policy entered into evidence reflects a commencement date of August 31, 1977, we have accepted the stipulation of the parties that it commenced on September 1, 1977.
/6/ The stipulation of the parties at one point describes this amount as $5,703,511. We agree with petitioner, however, that the record reflects that this was a computation error. At all times since 1971, Humana Inc. has owned only 62.35 percent of a corporation, Brentwood Hospital, Inc. ("Brentwood"). Brentwood has never been a part of the affiliated group which filed consolidated returns and respondent did not disallow the $89,460 attributable to it. When this sum is subtracted from the total amounts paid on policy number 1001, or $5,793,031, the difference is $5,703,571.
/7/ For reasons described in footnote 6 above, this amount is computed as the difference between total amounts paid on policy number 1003, or $5,963,006, and the payment by Brentwood, or $97,020.
/8/ For reasons described in footnote 6 above, this amount is computed as the difference between total amounts paid on policy number HCI-90178, or $7,663,533, and the payment by Brentwood, or $80,640.
/9/ This amount is computed as the difference between total amounts paid on policy number HCI-60178, or $2,878,125, and $975,000, which is the amount attributable to AMI and its subsidiaries prior to September 27, 1978, when AMI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Humana Inc. and which was not claimed by petitioner on the return for the taxable year ended August 31, 1979.
/10/ The amounts paid by Humana Inc.--representing the total of premiums for all the hospitals operated by Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries--were charged back to the subsidiaries based upon the number of occupied beds. Adjustments were made if, for example, a hospital operated by the subsidiary had a teaching program, an intern residence program, or nurse anesthetists as opposed to doctor anesthetists.
/11/ Effective June 1, 1979, the aggregate liability under Coverage C for policy number HCI-90178 was increased to $13 million.
/12/ The instant case presents only sole ownership of the captive insurance company. We express no opinion where the ownership of the captive insurance company is only predominant.
/13/ For financial reporting purposes, Humana Inc. prepared consolidated financial statements which included all of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, its investment in HCI stock would be eliminated on the consolidated financial statements. The net effect is that after the elimination of intercompany accounts the assets of HCI are included in the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, even if HCI were not included in the consolidated financial statements, Humana Inc. would properly account for its investment in HCI stock using the equity method. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock," AICPA (New York 1971). Accordingly, the investment of Humana Inc. in HCI stock would reflect the changes in the retained earnings of HCI.

CONCURRENCE OF JUDGE WHITAKER
WHITAKER, J., concurring: We are faced in this case with another aspect of the captive insurance problem--the deduction of insurance premiums between brother-sister corporations. The majority purports to decline as in Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, 71 T.C. 400, 413 (1978), affd. 640 F.2d 1010 (9th Cir. 1981) and Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 948, 956 (1985), on appeal (9th Cir., Dec. 13, 1985), to adopt respondent's "economic family" concept. See Rev. Rul. 77-316, 1977-2 C.B. 53 at 54. However, the majority refers repeatedly with apparent approval to decisions of other courts, including the opinion of the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit affirming our opinion in Carnation, all of which follow Carnation and adopt the economic family concept. The majority also quotes extensively with approval from the testimony of respondent's experts, Dr. Plotkin and Mr. Stewart, who have fully swallowed respondent's economic family concept. The dissenting opinion here as in the prior cases accuses the majority of having in fact adopted the economic family concept and charges us with failing to follow Moline Properties, Inc. v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436 (1943). I think it unfortunate that we--the majority- have allowed respondent's buzzword--economic family--to produce so much strained rationalization that we appear to have lost sight of the real issue, whether or not the contracts in question are insurance contracts.
It bears emphasizing at the outset that what this Court has so far dealt with is a single affiliated group, including the insurance entity, consisting of one parent corporation and one or more wholly owned subsidiaries. The majority correctly notes (footnote 12) that our opinion is limited to the consequences of insuring with a wholly owned captive. I suggest what we have decided and all that we have decided in this case and its two predecessors is simply that on the particular facts of these three cases we do not have insurance for tax purposes. Here the only insurance relationship is that which is purportedly created between entities which are related to each other through a single parent with no unrelated persons being insured or having material interests in any of the entities involved. In so doing we have not "pierced any corporate veil" or done violence to Moline Properties Inc.
There is also another equally compelling basis for our decision. Necessary elements of insurance are risk- shifting and risk- distributing. Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531 (1941); Commissioner v. Treganowan, 183 F.2d 288 (2d Cir. 1950). These two decisions are fundamental to this insurance issue. In Helvering v. Le Gierse, supra the Supreme Court recognized that there were two parties to the contract--an insurance company and an insured individual who were distinct legal entities. There was a contract of insurance and a related annuity contract, each of which were legally binding contracts. As Justice Murphy said:
Considered together, the contracts wholly fail to spell out any element of insurance risk. It is true that the "insurance" contract looks like an insurance policy, contains all the usual provisions of one, and could have been assigned or surrendered without the annuity. * * * The fact remains that annuity and insurance are opposites; in this combination the one neutralizes the risk customrily inherent in the other. * * * [312 U.S. at 541.]
The Second Circuit in Commissioner v. Treganowan, supra, defined risk-shifting as effected by a contract between the insurer and the insured, each of whom gambles on the risk. Risk-distributing on the other hand reduces the potential loss by spreading its cost throughout a group. In Humana as in Carnation and Clougherty, we looked at the facts and at the several corporate entities involved, and found neither risk- shifting nor risk-distributing. We have not invalidated the contracts; we simply found that the contracts involved were not contracts of insurance.
The majority here states "Payments to a captive insurance company are equivalent to additions to a reserve for losses. * * * It has long been recognized that sums set aside as an insurance reserve are not deductible." /1/ Again that is a correct analysis under these facts. If a single entity, party A, undertakes to indemnify an unrelated entity, party B, from a specific risk, at least superficially the risk has been shifted. But in order for the transaction to be economically sound for both parties, the premium would have to approximate the present value of the risk, equating to a reasonable self-insurance reserve. There has certainly been no distribution of the risk. However such a relationship might be characterized, it is not insurance. In the real world, this hypothetical transaction would not occur. Moreover, given that self- insurance reserves are not deductible, to characterize a contract between a parent and its wholly owned captive subsidiary, with no other insurance business, as insurance would exalt form over substance. For these two reasons, Carnation and Clougherty were inevitable. One does not need the economic family concept for this result. And given Carnation and Clougherty as correctly decided, the form over substance rationale is alone sufficient to prevent taxpayers from altering the result in the parent-subsidiary circumstance by the simple expedient of creating a sister insurance captive to insure its brother operating company. It requires very little further rationalization to reach the conclusion that in fact, as opposed to form, there is no risk shifting or risk distributing no matter where in the affiliated wholly owned group one places the captive insurance subsidiary.
I emphasize again that only in these factual contexts have we found that the purported insurance contract does not qualify as such for tax purposes. Whether or not the contract should be recognized as insurance for any other purpose is not an issue before us. In reaching this result we have not collapsed or looked behind the separate corporate existence of any party. As the Supreme Court did Le Gierse, we have merely applied to the facts before us the accepted definition of insurance and the well known "form over substance" doctrine. That we may someday be called upon to determine how much dilution from 100percent control or how much insurance business with unrelated entities is necessary to achieve risk-shifting and risk- distributing is a probable fact of life, but it should not interfere with our decision in this case.
STERRETT, CHABOT, NIMS, PARKER, HAMBLEN, JACOBS, and WILLIAMS, JJ., agree with this concurring opinion.

CONCURRENCE OF JUDGE HAMBLEN
HAMBLEN, J., concurring: In Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, I expressed my concern about the "economic family" concept. /1/ Noting that respondent's assertion of the economic family concept did not square with Moline Properties v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436 (1943), I felt that the Moline Properties issue was inacted unnecessarily into Clougherty by way of the economic family concept analogy. I could see little difference between the economic family concept described in Rev. Rul. 77-316, 1977-2 C.B. 53, and the determination made by the majority in Clougherty. However, I concluded that the Clougherty arrangement was not a true insurance arrangement as there was no risk distribution. Following a similar analysis, I concur only in the result of the majority opinion and agree in principle with Judge Whitaker's concurring opinion.
The majority cite proponents of the economic family concept as authority to support its determination. This, I feel, is neither appropriate nor necessary for the following reasons.
First, one has only to thumb through any text or hornbook on corporate tax law to see the arsenal available to respondent in related corporation transactions. Yet this plethora of available tools, whether codified or judicially developed, apparently is inadequate for respondent in this area, so he asserts an "economic family" theory which has ominous ramifications within and beyond the captive insurance area. /2/
More importantly, under the economic family theory asserted by respondent, there seems to be no real distinction between disregarding transactions between related corporations and disregarding their separate status. However, I submit that, generally, transactions between ANY entities, related or unrelated, should be repudiated or recharacterized only if they are not legally or factually what they purport to be. The majority's reliance on financial reports to buttress its conclusion only fuels the economic family fire; it consolidates two entities for tax purposes which are not permitted to file consolidated tax returns and, without a basis for so doing, erodes the long-standing principle of Moline Properties v. Commissioner, supra.
For these reasons, I strongly believe that we should decide the issue solely on a lack of risk shifting and risk distribution basis. In this respect, there appears to be no tax avoidance scheme. The inter-corporate contractual arrangements are not determined to be shams. Indeed, a business purpose for the transactions is obvious because the entities could not obtain insurance coverage elsewhere.
If we are to abrogate the insurance transaction between these related entities, we should do so by simply saying, without more, that there is neither shifting nor distribution of risk and, consequently, no valid insurance arrangement. If we cannot say that, or must say more than that, then it seems to me that we have valid insurance transactions between separate, though related entities.
In sum, I believe that the economic family theory may conflict with fundamental principles of tax law by invoking attribution among related corporations where it has not been legislated by Congress. /3/ I see no reason to give such a concept credence, as the majority is doing here. Consequently, I concur only in the result reached by the majority.
WHITAKER, J., agrees with this concurring opinion.

CONCURRENCE OF JUDGE KORNER
KORNER, J., concurring and dissenting in part: So far as the majority opinion holds that the premiums paid to HCI by petitioner Humana, Inc. (the common parent corporation) for insurance ON ITSELF may not be deducted as insurance premiums, I agree that such an outcome is controlled by our holdings in Carnation Co. v. Commissioner, 71 T.C. 400 (1978), affd. 640 F.2d 1010 (9th Cir. 1981), and Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 84 T.C. 948 (1985), on appeal (9th Cir. 1985). I therefore concur in that portion of the opinion.
With respect to the majority's holding that the same result obtains with respect to premiums paid by the Humana subsidiaries to HCI for comparable insurance on them and their employees, I dissent.
Neither Carnation nor Clougherty are authority for denying deductions for the amounts paid, as insurance premiums, by Humana Inc.'s subsidiaries to HCI. Said wholly-owned subsidiaries of Humana Inc. are related to HCI as brother-sister corporations. In Carnation, we found that Three Flowers (the wholly- owned offshore insurance subsidiary) was organized "to carry on the business of insurance and reinsurance of various multiple line risks including those of petitioner [Carnation] and its subsidiaries." 71 T.C. at 402. However, the issue of the deductibility of insurance premiums were the insurance contract is between corporations related as brother- sister was not decided. It was stipulated that for purposes of the case all premiums were to be deemed as having been paid and deducted by Carnation. /1/ In Clougherty, the wholly-owned subsidiary, Lombardy's, only business was the reinsurance of Clougherty's workers' compensation coverage. Clougherty was the taxpayer- petitioner. No subsidiaries of Clougherty related to Lombardy as brother-sister were involved.
In contrast with the factual situations presented in Carnation and Clougherty, the record herein shows that: (1) the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Humana Inc. were insured under the subject policies; (2) the subsidiaries are related to HCI as brother-sister, not as parent-subsidiary; (3) the amounts due under the subject policies, as premiums, were billed by HCI to Humana Inc. on a monthly basis; (4) Humana Inc. paid the total amount billed by HCI on a monthly basis; (5) later, the foregoing amounts were allocated and charged back by Humana Inc. to its appropriate subsidiaries; and (6) the subsidiaries are petitioners here. /2/ See sec. 1.1502-77(a), Income Tax Regs. Moreover, respondent does not contend that the existence of the said subsidiaries as separate and viable tax entities should be ignored, or that they were organized in order to unlawfully avoid the payment of tax. Respondent similarly does not contend that the subsidiaries did not engage in any business activities.
I find the majority's holding with respect to the premiums paid by the Humana subsidiaries to HCI (the brother-sister situation) deficient in at least two important respects:
1. The majority relies heavily upon, and quotes extensively from the joint opinion of respondent's expert witnesses Plotkin and Stewart. A careful examination of that opinion, however, leads me to the conclusion that it gives no support to the position of the majority on the brother-sister question. As the quotations show, the thrust of the report is aimed at the parent-subsidiary question, concluding that there is no true insurance (hence no deductible premium) because there is no transfer of the risk of loss from the "insured" parent to its wholly-owned subsidiary "insurer." The reasoning apparently is that the subsidiary's stock is shown as an asset on the parent's balance sheet. If the parent suffers an insured loss which the subsidiary (HCI in this case) has to pay, the assets of the subsidiary insurer will be depleted by the amount of the payment. This, in turn, will reduce the value of the subsidiary's shares as an asset of the parent (Humana), so that, in effect, the assets of the "insured" parent are bearing the loss as far as true economic impact is concerned. As the experts' joint opinion (quoted by the majority) clearly puts it:
True insurance relieves the firm's balance sheet of any potential impact of the financial consequences of the insured peril. For the price of the premiums, the insured rids itself of any economic stake in whether or not the loss occurs. * * * [However] as long as the firm deals with its captive, its balance sheet cannot be protected from the financial vicissitudes of the insured peril.
* * *
CONCLUSION
So long as the firm does not transfer to another the ultimate responsibility for the financial consequences of its risks, it remains the risk bearer and faces the uncertainty of each year's actual financial losses. The attempted placing of a firm's risks, directly or indirectly, in its "insurance affiliates" did not accomplish a transference of risk, or constitute an insurance transaction as a matter of insurance theory or economic reality. We find our conclusion in complete accord with the clear theoretical and applied teachings of the economics, insurance theory, risk management, and captive self- insurance literatures.
Accepting, arguendo, that this is an accurate statement and is in line with our reasoning in Carnation and Clougherty, it nevertheless provides no support to the majority's position in the brother-sister situation. Humana's insured subsidiaries own no stock in HCI, nor vice versa. The subsidiaries' balance sheets and net worth would in no way be affected by the payment of an insured claim by HCI. /3/ It follows that when the Humana subsidiaries paid THEIR OWN premiums for THEIR OWN insurance, as the facts show, they shifted their risks to HCI. The rationale of Carnation and Clougherty thus does not apply, and such premiums should be allowable as deductions to the subsidiaries.
Upon what other basis can these premiums be disallowed? That is the subject of my next point of disagreement with the majority.
2. The majority in this case for the first time extends the rationale of Carnation and Clougherty to the brother-sister situation. In addition, the majority cites and relies upon Stearns- Roger Corp. v. United States, 774 F.2d 414 (10th Cir. 1985), and Mobil Oil Corp. v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 555 (1985). See also Beech Aircraft Corp. v. United States, 797 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1986). A reading of these cases shows that each of them, either explicitly or implicitly, has adopted the "economic family" concept advanced by respondent in Rev. Rul. 77-316, 1977-2 C.B. 53, where it is said:
There is no economic shifting or distributing of risks of loss with respect to the risks carried or retained by the wholly owned * * * subsidiaries * * * [T]he insuring parent corporation and its domestic subsidiaries, and the wholly owned "insurance" subsidiary, through separate corporate entities, represent one economic family with the result that those who bear the ultimate economic burden of loss are the same persons who suffer the loss. To the extent that the risks of loss are not retained in their entirety by * * * or reinsured with * * * insurance companies that are unrelated to the economic family of insureds, there is no risk- shifting or risk-distributing, and no insurance, the premiums for which are deductible under section 162 of the Code.
Thus, the amounts paid by the [parents], and their domestic subsidiaries, and retained by [the insurance subsidiaries], respectively, are not deductible under section 162 of the Code as "ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year." Because such amounts remain within the economic family and under the practical control of the respective parent in each situation, there has been no amount "paid or incurred." * * *
In spite of its citation of, and reliance upon the above cases, the majority in the instant case (as in Carnation and Clougherty) again purports to refuse to accept respondent's economic family argument. Instead, the majority passes over the substantial issues which are raised with the airy statement that "we hold that it is more appropriate to examine all of the facts to decide whether or to what extent there has been a shifting of the risk from one entity to the captive insurance company."
I find the majority's attempted distinction here to be disingenuous and entirely unconvincing. What facts are there which support the conclusion here that there was no shifting of risk from the Humana subsidiaries to HCI: The subsidiaries, WHO PAID THEIR OWN PREMIUMS FOR THEIR OWN INSURANCE, had no ownership in HCI, the insurer, nor did HCI have any ownership in them. If we are to recognize HCI and the hospital subsidiaries as valid separate business entities, conducting active legitimate businesses and devoid of sham--neither respondent nor the majority herein say to the contrary--then how can we say that there was no shifting of risk from the hospital-subsidiaries/sisters to the insurer/brother (HCI), without violation the time-honored rule that each taxpayer is a separate entity for tax purposes? Moline Properties, Inc. v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436 (1943); Burnet v. Commonwealth Imp. Co., 287 U.S. 415 (1932). The only way it can be done is to ignore the separate entities of Humana, its hospital subsidiaries and HCI, to call them all one "economic family" and to say that what happens to one happens to all of them. On the facts of the brother-sister situation presented here, I think that is what the majority is doing, and it ought to say so forthrightly. I would still disagree with such a position, but at least it would have the virtue of candor. Other than "economic family," I can think of no theory on which the result here can be rationalized, and the majority has not articulated any.
This Court has never adopted respondent's economic family theory, /4/ and has expressed--justifiably--its concern regarding the adoption of such theory and its application to other areas of the tax law. /5/ The theory of Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531 (1941) may have been adequate to sustain the holdings in Carnation and Clougherty, where only a parent and its insurance subsidiary were involved. It cannot be stretched to cover the instant brother-sister situation, where there was nothing--equity ownership or otherwise--to offset the shifting of risk from the hospital subsidiaries to HCI. If the majority is to accomplish the fell deed here, "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them" /6/ to such a result.
SHIELDS, CLAPP, SWIFT, GERBER, WRIGHT, and WELLS, JJ., agree with this concurring and dissenting opinion.
FOOTNOTES TO CONCURRENCE OF JUDGE KORNER
/1/ Carnation and its subsidiary corporations that were required to file Federal income tax returns each filed separate Federal income tax returns rather than a consolidated return.
/2/ As stated in the majority's findings of fact, supra, Humana Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries filed consolidated Federal income tax returns for the years in issue. Respondent conceded that HCI was not a member of the affiliated group of corporations of which Humana Inc. was the common parent. HCI was not able to and did not file its income tax returns on a consolidated basis with Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. Secs. 1501, 1504(a), 1504(b). HCI filed separate returns for all the pertinent years.
/3/ The majority, at footnote 13 of the majority opinion, states that Humana Inc. (the common parent), filed consolidated balance sheets for all of its subsidiaries (including HCI) for FINANCIAL reporting purposes. The effect, says the majority, is that the assets of HCI were included in the consolidated statements. I question whether this would be proper for TAX reporting purposes, where HCI was not and could not be a member of the consolidated returns which were filed. See my footnote 2, supra.
The majority furthr states that even if HCI was not properly includible in Humana's consolidated balance sheet for tax reporting purposes, nevertheless Humana would reflect its investment in HCI's stock under the "equity" method. Ergo if HCI pays an insured claim against one of its brother/sister subsidiaries, its assets, and therefore the assets of Humana PARENT will decrease, and therefore Humana PARENT is the one who truly bears the loss. Consistent with this reasoning, is respondent prepared to allow a deduction to Humana PARENT when HCI pays an insured claim against one of the brother/sister hospital subsidiaries?

After letting tongues wagging via their commendable silver screen performances in Ram-Leela and Bajirao Mastani, Ranveer and Deepika have given a major reason for their fans to rejoice by taking their relationship a step ahead.
The pre-wedding festivities of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone's wedding have begun in Bengaluru. Moreover, we hope that the wedding turns out to be an unforgettable affair. Deepika participated in the puja dressed in a bright tangerine suit from the house of Sabyasachi.
The actress was accompanied by her team - stylist Shaleena Nathani, make-up artist Sandhya Shekar, and hair stylist Gabriel Georgiou - as the bride-to-be posed for pictures.

"With the blessings of our families, it gives us vast joy in sharing that our wedding is set to take place on the 14th and 15th of November, 2018. Lots of love, Deepika and Ranveer", they wrote in a joint statement. Afterwards, the couple will be hosting two receptions in Mumbai and Bengaluru.
Ranveer and Deepika are expected to get hitched in the scenic Lake Como, Italy. The two will have a traditional Konkani style wedding, as Deepika belongs to the Saraswat Brahmin community from Karnataka and her mother tongue is Konkani. We hear that master chefs will prepare the dishes on the exclusive wedding menu, which will be prepared right at the venue.
Fans are more than excited about the wedding, and are lapping up each and every detail of the functions.

Kansas attempts to be “abortion-free”
June 24, 2011	
Marshall Thompson Kansas has a new law that requires its abortion clinics, all three of them, to meet new regulatory standards and apply for annual licenses. The new standards require major renovations to existing clinic buildings that may be impossible to accomplish in time. The broad law gives the state’s secretary of health and environment several different avenues for…

Multiracial students and the evolution of affirmative action
June 17, 2011	
Jay Willis Reduced to its elements, affirmative action is a relatively straightforward concept. Colleges and universities consider an applicant’s racial and ethnic background to ensure that they enroll sufficient numbers of students from traditionally underrepresented groups. But schools are now grappling with new Department of Education regulations that, for the first time, allow students to identify themselves as members…
Eric Holder kicks off the tenth annual ACS convention
June 16, 2011	
Jessica Jackson Standing in front of the sold-out dinner at the opening night of the tenth annual American Constitution Society National Convention, keynote speaker Eric Holder waited patiently for the roaring applause to finish. His message to the hundreds of progressive lawyers, judges, and students before him was simple, but very important for all those…
Top 10 Features of the GOP Debate
June 15, 2011	
Jake Laperruque 10. The Child Count Competition. Rick Santorum opened this contest at the start of the debate by mentioning he had 7 children. Michelle Bachmann bested him by announcing she had 5 children, plus 23 foster children. Newt Gingrich forgot about his children, and just said that we need to end the “Obama depression.”…
The Filibuster Returns
June 10, 2011	
Yevgeny Shrago Both parties saw the other side of the double-edged filibuster earlier this week. Democrats, lead by Dick Durbin, prevented an attempt to delay implementation of a cap on debit-card interchange fees that passedlast year as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform. Despite 54 votes for the highly contentious measure, the amendment failed; its bipartisan supporters were…
Crowdscouring a Beer Company Buyout
June 10, 2011	
Anthony Kammer I came across an interesting post in the Blog of the Legal Times yesterday about two advertising executives who attempted to raise $300 million from online investorks in order to purchase Pabst Blue Ribbon. Rather than approaching large investors, they came up with a rather brilliant method for crowdsourcing the buyout. The two men, Michael Migliozzi II…
Human Trafficking Sanctions Ineffective
June 8, 2011	
Marshall Thompson The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) is the main U.S. law to combat slave labor and sex slavery. While most of its provisions appear to be having some positive effects on human trafficking worldwide, a key aspect of it has become little more than a sad joke. To motivate international cooperation, the law requires the…
Head in the iClouds
June 7, 2011	
Jake Laperruque Yesterday, Steve Jobs wowed the tech world with exciting announcement of Apple’s newest product, iCloud. iCloud is Apple’s long awaited cloud computing tool. It enables users to sync iPhones (and XL sized iPhones ) with Mac computers, and instantly access files and exchange them between devices, using the Internet. Cloud computing is an excellent way to make…
Tenn. Smacks Down Local Anti-discrimination Laws
June 7, 2011	
Marshall Thompson Last week Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee signed a new state law that prohibits local governments from passing their own anti-discrimination laws. The bill comes in response to a Nashville ordinance prohibiting housing and employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. According to Businessweek Haslam said, “We’re not in favor of discrimination in any form…
Some Courts Are Still Afraid of the Internet
June 6, 2011	
Michael Stephan Electronic filing of court documents has become a relatively common practice in this country. Nearly all jurisdictions allow electronic filing in some manner, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly permit electronic filing. The benefits of filing documents electronically rather than physically are clear: it’s typically cheaper, faster, and easier. Nevertheless, some courts…
Borrowing our way to the American Dream
June 6, 2011	
Yevgeny Shrago The New York Times noted recently that financial regulation in the mortgage market has made for some strange bedfellows: advocacy groups like the NAACP and industry groups like the American Banker’s Association have joined together to oppose more stringent regulations. While the banker groups worry about shrinking profit margins and lower salaries, advocacy groups worry…

Los Blancos, with captain Sergio Ramos suspended after deliberately collecting a yellow card in the first leg, had been looking to build on a slender 2-1 lead from that game in Amsterdam and stay on course for a potential fourth straight European triumph.
However, after Raphael Varane’s header rattled the crossbar, Ajax raced into an early lead through Hakim Ziyech before Dusan Tadic set up David Neres for a second in the 18th minute.
tinyurl
Real Madrid were forced into two changes when Lucas Vazquez and Vinicius Junior went off injured, with substitute Gareth Bale hitting the post just before half-time.
Ajax looked to have put the tie to bed when Tadic swept in a brilliant third goal just after the hour – which was eventually given following an extensive Video Assistant Referee review to check if the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.

Christina was born in the royal castle Tre Kronor on 18 December S. 8 December] 1626. Her parents were the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus and his German wife, Maria Eleonora, had already had two daughters—a stillborn princess in 1620, and then the first Princess Christina, who was born in 1623 and died the following year.3] Excited expectation surrounded Maria Eleonora’s third pregnancy in 1626. When the baby was born, it was first thought to be a boy as it was “hairy” and screamed “with a strong, hoarse voice.”she later wrote in her autobiography that, “Deep embarrassment spread among the women when they discovered their mistake.” The king, though, was very happy, stating, “She’ll be clever, she has made fools of us all!”6] From most accounts, Gustav Adolf appears to have been closely attached to his daughter, and she appears to have admired him greatly.

Facing 30 Years in Prison For Violating Arms Length in Short Sale
This is the perfect reminder that when you are going to short sale a home or purchase a short sale you must abide by all of the rules. The economy is in enough trouble without people further trying to scam the system.
Just another story to read for those people planning on scamming their lender in a short sale. This is just one of several cases I've read about lately. This is why I refuse to list and help any homeowner navigate through a short sale if I detect they aren't 100% honest, or if they indicate that it's going to be a pain to get them to provide the information that will be needed to keep a short sale process on track and moving forward. Too many people are involved, and I don't want to waste peoples time if the seller thinks it's just a big game.
Yes, banks take Arms Length Agreements seriously. So if you think you're going to short sale your house to your parents or another relative, then rent it back from them with plans to buy it in the future, you are conspiring to commit a crime. Goodbye and good luck. Ask yourself, is the buyer connected to you in any way by blood or business? If yes, they are not eligible to purchase your short sale. Why do lenders like BOA ask for 5 digits of a potential buyers social security #? It's mainly so they can research and verify it's an Arms Length Transaction. I love the people that call me and say they want to short sale their house and they already have a buyer lined up, but they need an agent to help them.
Many people don't realize that these days lenders and FBI agents are actually going door to door to verify that buyers who checked the box on their mortgage application claiming he/she was buying a primary residence, are actually living in the property. I know of one case where FBI showed up at a house 2 months after a closing where buyer had claimed he was buying primary residence, and the tenant answered the door. They asked if he was the owner, and he said no, he was renting and had been there for 2 months. They put that buyer on their list to file mortgage fraud charges against, which they did.
http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/jun/13/henderson-couple-charged-bank-fraud-short-sale/#axzz2WWXtJqoq
What are you in for? Well, we bought this house for $600,000.00, then the bottom fell out of the market. We heard about how all these people were getting rich flipping houses, so we decided to short sale our house for $300,000.00 to my cousin, then we were going to buy it back from him for $400,000.00. It sounded perfect, we would reduce our mortgage by $200,000.00 and he would make around $100,000.00 for his trouble. We didn't understand what an Arms Length Agreement was. It's the banks fault.
Short Sales are Debt Settlements that Need to be Taken Seriously.

Landslide injures tourists at famed ‘shipwreck’ beach in Greece
14/09/2018
The landslide occurred Thursday on the Navagio Beach, or Shipwreck Beach, on the northwestern coast of the island.
Rescuers from the local coast guard and the fire department soon arrived on the scene to evacuate the beach and prevent boats from approaching.
"A giant wave hit the small boats and debris hit people on the beach", she said.
An air and sea search was conducted as a precaution in case there was anyone trapped under the rocks.
Footage posted on social media showed people running in panic as a large section of the cliff peeled off and crashed down close to several bathers.
A couple of small boats overturned from the force of the fall that caused high waves, witnesses told authorities.
Meghan Markle mocked by half-sister Samantha in latest rant
Royal fans went wild once the photo was posted. "She has an obligation especially to treat our father with kindness". This is the end of your normal life, the end of your privacy - everything'. "This is a happy time for us".
Among those injured was a 34-year-old woman from the Czech Republic, who suffered a fractured vertebra.
There were at least seven people injured in the rockfall, but according to coastguard officials, none of them received life-threatening injuries.
Tourists board a boat at the beach Navagio following a rockfall, on the island of Zakynthos, Greece September 13, 2018.
Her husband and two children were hospitalised with minor injuries.
FILE - In this Friday, Sept. 8, 2017 file photo, people enjoy the popular beach of Navagio, or Shipwreck Beach, on the western island of Zakynthos, Greece.

Patient Experience
WE are the patient experience.
WE are centered in care, powered by pride.
Patient-centered care is the guiding principle of JPS Health Network. The patient experience is the sum of all interactions that influence our patients’ perceptions of every aspect of the network.
Everyone who wears the JPS badge represents the patient experience to every patient and family member seeking care. Their commitment to our mission of transforming healthcare delivery for the communities we serve is evidenced by every smile, laugh and act of compassion. More than 5,000 nurses, practitioners, ancillary and support services team members make up the JPS Health Network.

THE ONLY QUESTION ABOUT GUN REGISTRATION
by Alan Korwin
Only one thing is overlooked in the common sense proposals to register guns, so here it is. How exactly would writing down my name, or your name, help arrest criminals or make you safer? Although at first blush, gun listing has a sort of tantalizing appeal, on reflection you have to wonder whether gun lists would be an instrument of crime control at all.
The unfortunate answer is that, no matter how good it feels when the words first pass your ears, registering honest gun owners doesn't stop criminals, and in fact focuses in exactly the opposite direction. It is an allocation of resources that has no chance of achieving its goal, if that goal is the reduction of crime.
1. Registering 70 million American households is extremely expensive.
Do you know what it takes to run a database that big? You need 19,000 changes daily, just to keep up with people who move every ten years. Floor after floor of cubicle after cubicle for employees with permanent jobs, payroll, parking and dry cleaning bills. It's a federal jobs program all by itself, all in the common sense -- but deceptive name -- of stopping crime. How many criminals do you figure will register when all is said and done? That's right, none, and the planners know that. All that money and time, invested on tracking the innocent.
2. Americans who fail to register would become felons without committing a crime.
Under registration, activity that is a common practice and has been perfectly legal since inception makes you a felon. Think about that. Possession of private property would subject you to felony arrest, if the property isn't on the government's master list. Boy, that doesn't sound like the American way. No other evil is needed, there is no victim and no inherent criminal act takes place.
3. Registration, if enacted, will create an underground market for unregistered guns bigger than the drug trade.
How many times must an elite forbid what the public wants, before learning the unintended consequences of outlawing liberties? People get what they want either way, it's just a question of how much crime the government itself forces to accompany it. With respect to guns, the last thing you want to encourage is the creative import programs and price supports that drug dealers enjoy, for gun runners.
4. People have said to me, "But Alan, if all guns were registered and there was a crime, then you could tell."
Tell what? If your neighbor is shot, that's not probable cause to search everyone with a matching caliber in a ten-block radius. The evidence needed to conclusively link a person to a crime has no connection at all to a registration plan -- police aren't waiting for official lists so they can start catching murderers. Gun registration schemes lack a crime prevention component.
5. You don't really think authorities would use gun registration lists to confiscate weapons from people, do you?
Despite current examples of exactly that in New York and California, and global history for the past century, this couldn't really happen, do you think? Who would even support such a thing in a country like America, with its Bill of Rights? The guarantees against confiscating property, unwarranted seizures and the right to keep and bear arms would surely forestall any such abuse of power.
And what about the so-called First Amendment test? If it's OK for arms it must pass muster for words too. Why would an honest writer object to being on the government list of approved writers? Why indeed.
Pile logic on logic, some people just feel the government should register everything, just to keep control. When government has that much control, you no longer possess your liberties. You're living where government lists define who can do what, and where people control trumps crime control -- the gun registration model precisely.
I might favor registration if the system would include criminals. In fact, I'd favor testing the system on them first. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a widely known case (Haynes v. U.S., 1968), has already determined that a felon who has a gun cannot be compelled to complete such forms, because it violates the Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. That's right, registration -- not in your case of course but in the case of a criminal -- is a self-indictment of a crime, and is therefore prohibited.
Gun listing is a feel-good deception that passes unquestioned by the media, engorges the federal bureaucracy, and undercuts the linchpins of American freedoms. It has no more place in a free society than a government authorized list of words, and should be rejected outright. Elected officials who promote such a scheme are opposing the very Constitution they take an oath to preserve, protect and defend, and deserve to be removed from office.
Sincerely
Alan Korwin

“He wasn’t getting into the party mood and couldn’t raise a smile when the cameras weren’t on.

“Everyone was worried about him – the break-up with Megan seems to have hit him very hard.”
The insider then continued to say that Pete says he’s doing well and is simply just fine:
“Pete is feeling ok about everything and isn’t moping around,” says the insider.
“He is trying to enjoy life again as he has a lot to look forward to professionally.
“Of course he isn’t himself, he is hurting a lot.”

A common misconception that many retirees have is that after they have retired, Medicare is going to be there for them. It will cover every medical bill that they will have from that point on. Unfortunately, for those that do not realize the fallacy of this concept soon enough, they may be paying for several tens of thousands and doctor bills, or hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital bills, as a result of not getting some type of supplemental coverage. Medigap insurance has been around for many years. There are several major insurance companies that provide this. This is going to be an additional cost. This is why you need to do a little research before selecting the very first policy that you find.
How To Get Quotes For Different Medigap Policies
If you do want to get quotes for Medigap policies, you can either contact local insurance providers in Buffalo, New York, or you can use the Internet to help you find them. Submitting your information to these insurance providers will allow them to calculate how much you are going to pay. They will have different policy levels that you can choose from just like any ordinary health insurance policy. The amount that you pay is usually reflective of how much coverage you will have. In many cases, it's better to go with the most expensive plan so that you eliminate the possibility of being blindsided by very expensive medical bills.
Is The Most Expensive Policy Always The Best?
Although we had just stated that you should pay the most money for Medigap insurance, this is only reflective of contacting one particular health insurance provider. Your goal is to get multiple quotes from different companies and look at all of the rates collectively. You will see that there are policies that are virtually identical, but they could be several hundred dollars a month less then other policies that are the same. In this case, you will want to choose the Buffalo, New York Medigap policy that is the lowest price which will come from one particular insurance provider.
Will It Take Long To Get The Policy In Effect
There is usually no lag time in between the moment that you officially sign up for the policy, making your first payment, and when the coverage begins. Making the payment is usually an indicator of when it starts. If you can do all of this research quickly, if you are worried about doctor visits that you have coming up, you can have this in force long before you actually go to the doctor. This will ensure that your doctor visit, prescription drugs, or even a hospital stay will be covered by this policy. It will make sure that you will not have to lose any of your retirement as a result of simply taking care of yourself when you need medical attention.
What is wonderful about Medigap policies is that they quite literally cover any and all additional medical bills that you will have that Medicare will not touch. Medicare has a limit to how much they can pay on all of the claims, and this supplemental insurance will do the rest. It is something that many people do not think about until the last minute, so it is a good idea to do your research early. Once it is in force, you will be fully covered for any and all medical procedures that you need to have done, giving you the peace of mind knowing that your retirement is yours to spend on something else other than medical costs.

Republican Lawmakers Target “Pit Bull” Andrew Weissmann, Others From Special Counsel Office.	
March 16, 2019
Elder Patriot| Congressional Republicans Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, perhaps buoyed by the presence the new Attorney, General William Barr, have sent a letter asking the DOJ to release documents and communications, as well as requesting answers to multiple and detailed questions about Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad.
Both Weissmann and Ahman were high-ranking Justice Department officials during Operation Hurricane Crossfire and both are now with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team. Weissmann has earned the distinction of being Mueller’s pit bull.
According to then-Assistant Attorney General Bruce Ohr’s Congressional testimony he briefed both Weissmann, then the head of DOJ’s fraud section, and Zainab Ahmad, a terrorism prosecutor who, at the time, was assigned to work with Lynch as a senior counselor, along with a number of other FBI and DOJ officials, about the high potential for bias that existed in the Steele dossier, months prior to the 2016 election.
Ohr testified that he used the meetings to warn them about the veracity of the contents of Steele dossier.
Catherine Herridge:
During his testimony, Ohr said he stressed during the 2016 meetings — many of which took place before the Page surveillance warrant was obtained — the potential bias and conflicts associated with Steele and the dossier, which was commissioned by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign and handled by opposition-research firm Fusion GPS. The surveillance warrant application drew on the unverified Trump dossier.
As far as we know, Ohr’s warnings were never revealed to the FISA court, however.
Now Meadows, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Government Operations, and Jordan, the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, want to know whether Weissmann and others, ignored Ohr’s warnings.
They sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting documents that might hold the answers to their questions.
Jordan Meadows Letter to AG… by on Scribd
The Republican lawmakers are specifically looking for all information regarding “actions taken or not taken” by Weissmann of Ahmad following their meeting with Bruce Ohr.
Writing in response to the revelations contained in Bruce Ohr’s recently released testimony about the need to corroborate the Steele dossier before presenting it as evidence, Jordan and Meadows wrote:
“This development raises questions about the impartiality and independence of Weissmann and Ahmad as senior members of the Special Counsel investigation. We write to determine what steps both Weissmann and Ahmad took to apprise Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III and the Justice Department of their contacts with Ohr and the substance of those meetings before their assignment to the Special Counsel’s office.”
Meadows and Jordan’s concerns are well founded. In October 2017, we noted Weissmann’s penchant for prosecutorial overreach was likely one of the reasons for his inclusion on the special counsel’s team.
Perhaps even more concerning, and more relevant to what we’ve come to know as the special counsel investigation has dragged on, is Weissmann’s penchant for hiding exculpatory evidence during his years as a prosecutor.
The omission of exculpatory evidence, such as the funding of the dossier by the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign, is evident throughout the FISC application.
Jordan and Meadows are asking AG Barr for all documents that might speak to how the Department of Justice and special counsel possibly handled the situation and if Weissmann and Ahmad disclosed their meeting with Ohr.
Citing the Justice Department’s mission to “ensure fair and impartial administration of justice” and noting that “The Supreme Court has advised that federal prosecutors are ‘not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as [their] obligation to govern at all,’ Weissmann’s and Ahmad’s receipt of biased information before their appointment to the Special Counsel’s Office puts into question their impartially, the very reason for establishing an independent Special Counsel investigation.”
The Republican lawmakers wrote to Barr:
That date for Barr’s response passed yesterday but it doesn’t mean that the attorney general is ignoring their request as Rod Rosenstein did. Barr may yet fulfill it directly or he may choose to take the request under advisement for consideration by his prosecutors, or both.
Note: To the best of our knowledge there has been no formal “investigation” launched, when we say “… Begin Investigation Into Mueller’s “Pit Bull” Andrew Weisman … ” in the title, we are referring to their request for documents, and answers regarding Weisman’s actions.

HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM
HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM
“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas Jefferson
ELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.
Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.
Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.
Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”
Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?
After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.
So, what gives?
Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”
As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”
The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.
Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.
One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.
Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.
Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.
These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.
No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.
So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.
And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.
Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.
EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.
HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP
“Impeach!” It’s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama’s administration – but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it’s back with a vengeance.
Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “I” word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”
Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.
Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America’s new Richard Nixon.
“Watergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. “Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I’m not going to stop asking them.”
Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.
The posters read: “If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. … Resign now.”
But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?
At this time, there’s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.
“The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,” Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:
For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.
However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.
A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”
However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.

US Farmers Expect Lower Fertilizer Prices in 2014
Posted on May 2, 2014 by Sarah J Cohen
It seems that prices of fertilizers come out lower this year in the United States compared to previous cropping years. “We’re seeing significant cuts in fertilizer prices for N, phosphate and potash compared to this time last year”, says a US economist.
As a result, American farmers expect to see lower fertilizer bill this year which increases their chances to make good profits and line up their pockets.
According to estimates of some industry experts, a corn & soybean farmer is expect to pay about 20 pc less for fertilizer in 2014 than in 2013 due to good weather conditions and sufficient market supply.
If good weather holds, the lower prices will be a good opportunity for some farmers who were unable to use fertilizers in poor soils for economic and cost reasons.
Fertilizer applications lowered in 2012 due to a wet fall in the eastern Corn Belt and extreme drought in the western Corn Belt. Wet conditions have hampered most US farmers to use fertilizers for much of the Midwest earlier this year.

Why Mr Trump has made me angry
Posted on 5th October 2017 in Blog 4
Click to view 'Comments' section -->
Every time I see the television clip of President Donald Trump describing the suspect in the Las Vegas attack – the worst mass shooting in modern US history – a “demented man”, I get angry. It was such an insensitive and harmful thing to say. By attributing the killing of 59 people and the injuring of more than 500 to someone with dementia, Trump’s statement feeds straight into the stigma and confusion that still clings to the condition.
Words are very, very important. I say this not just because they are my stock in trade, but because it’s true. In the second dementia blog I ever wrote, in February 2014, I mused on the power of language and its formidable ability to communicate and miscommunicate; to soothe and to wound, to clarify and obfuscate – and to influence attitudes. To greater and lesser degrees, words always have an impact. Uttered in the glare of global media by the leader of the world’s most powerful country, their force is unparalleled.
The word “demented” is rarely used now, even in the context of dementia itself. To use it in the context of the suspected perpetrator of multiple murders is as extraordinary in this day and age as it is unforgiveable. It also got me thinking about the word itself and why Trump’s use of it provoked such a strong reaction in me.
It’s because by saying that someone is demented you turn them into their condition – in grammatical terms, you turn the noun “dementia”, into the verb, “to dement”. There are no equivalent words for diseases such as cancer or Parkinson’s. We don’t say someone is “cancered” or “Parkinsoned”.
So, with one word (demented), we undo all the advances that are being made around the language of dementia and the important work that is being done to inform society about what dementia is – thus positively influencing people’s attitudes towards it.
I am thinking here of phrases such as: “See the person, not the dementia” and “I have dementia, it doesn’t have me”. By using the word demented (even in the context of the condition itself), we reverse these statements: we are in effect saying that dementia does indeed have the person, that he or she is the condition, or at least its walking embodiment.
But, as anyone who knows me or my writing will testify, I’m a glass half full girl and even as I was writing this blog I was delighted to hear on Radio 4 a wonderful interview with Edward Hall, son of the late, legendary director and founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Sir Peter Hall.
I hadn’t realised that Sir Peter Hall had developed dementia before he died. Edward (himself a theatre director) described his father’s prolific career and his professional influence on him, then turned to Sir Peter’s final years, speaking eloquently about what it was like to see his father’s mental faculties fade over the last six years.
“It’s been a slow grieving process, a slow period of saying goodbye as my father came and went .. in the last couple of years sometimes he would go for months without speaking at all”. How many of us will relate to that description.
And then, finally, Edward Hall spoke of how “extraordinarily well” his father had been looked after, first at Denville Hall, a care home for the theatrical community in north-west London, and then within accommodation at Charterhouse in the City of London.
“Caring for people with dementia is a highly skilled job requiring a lot of patience, and I’ve been very moved by the way everybody treated him, and the dignity with which they treated him, particularly towards the end of his life”.
It was refreshing to hear praise and recognition for care professionals who all too often hit the headlines for the wrong reasons. If only a certain American whose words are heard throughout the world could have displayed the same thoughtfulness as Edward Hall when he spoke. If only.

Thanks Vicki. Thoughtless words really can hurt.

You do know the word Demented stems from a Latin root meaning to be out of one’s mind? You do know that a single word can have multiple contexts and meanings? If anything – the term dementia should be dropped when dealing with the illness you describe and a new term should be used in its pace; this way the term “demented” could still be used as it was originally intended without causing you any harm.

I agree with your view on dementia and words that hurt.
However, I do not believe at all that the president was using the term “demented” to refer to dementia.
The term “demented” actually has multiple meanings.
If you look at Merriam Webster, the primary meaning of the word is actually as a synonym for “insane,” with a use regarding a criminal. The word is not commonly used at all, but please remember there are multiple definitions for some words.

Swiss banks to tighten due diligence process to prevent un-taxed assets
Home 2012 February 24 Swiss banks to tighten due diligence process to prevent un-taxed assets

Switzerland has asked its banks to tighten due diligence process to prevent un-taxed assets in their accounts without violating client confidentiality.
The measures come on the back of growing international pressure on Swiss authorities to act against any possible hoarding of illicit and untaxed money in Switzerland-based banks including from India.
“The focus is on enhanced due diligence requirements for banks when accepting assets as well as a requirement for foreign clients to make a declaration on the fulfillment of their tax obligations,” Swiss Federal Council, the country’s top policy-making authority has said. The new measures are expected to come in force by September this year.
Swiss banks are known to have the strongest secrecy clauses globally, which have helped them attract the rich and mighty clients from across the world, but has also given them a ‘tax haven’ tag.
Swiss government, however, opposed the idea of ‘automatic information exchange’ with any other country, asserting the ‘bank client confidentiality’ should be respected as far as possible.
New Delhi and Switzerland have amended their tax treaty to allow India to access the information on unaccounted money for taxation purposes only though its scope has been widened to cover banking transactions.
The proposed steps include a greater international cooperation and taxation of investment income and capital gains for Swiss bank clients in the future.
“The Federal Council’s aim is to create favourable framework conditions for the Swiss financial centre that boost its competitiveness and at the same time are accepted worldwide. Abuses of bank client confidentiality should be prevented insofar as possible,” it said in a statement.
It has also proposed international withholding tax agreements for taxing the clients as per the regulations of their home country, while safeguarding their privacy.
“Despite the fact that some issues have not yet been fully resolved, there is international interest in this approach and it will be pursued by Federal Council beyond the agreements already negotiated with Germany and the UK,” it said.
Swiss banks levy a withholding tax of 26% on income earned on assets belonging to German customers, roughly equivalent to the current rate of tax charged on such income in Germany. Earlier this month, the CBI Chief had said at a function that Indians are the largest depositors in Swiss banks.
Within days, the Swiss Embassy said in a statement that such estimates and statistics lacked evidence and were uncorroborated.
Black money has taken the centrestage politically with the main opposition party BJP launching a scathing attack on the UPA government for shielding those having bank accounts is tax havens and Switzerland.

Justice is blind but knows how to cash a check.
Posted By: Jason Parker October 14, 2013
Justice is blind but knows how to cash a check.
While the United States of America was founded on democratic ideals and the notion of rule by the people for the people, one is also often bombarded with the idea of America as the freest country, blessed by any deity of one’s choosing, and perhaps even without fault. However, one who explores the history and structure of our system of government would likely notice that, much like any other system of government, it is not without its flaws. Popular elections tend to appeal to a voter’s emotions and not their sense of reason. While certainly not the only flaw in our democratic republic, this particular one can be the most dangerous with lasting ripple effects. Of all branches of government, the judicial is the one in which these ripple effects could have the most lasting and damaging of all. For this reason, judicial elections are a bane to the health and longevity of our judicial system, and as a result, a bane to the health and longevity of our system of government as a whole.
It did not escape our so-called Founding Fathers that the vitality of our judicial branch relied heavily upon the ideal of judicial independence. Writing Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton vigorously expressed the importance of judicial independence as a counter-balance to the legislative and the executive branches. He also asserts that the judicial branch is the least dangerous to the rights granted by the Constitution (Hamilton).
However, this was before judicial review as a result of Marbury v. Madison. It now serves as care taker of sorts of the rights afforded by the United States Constitution. For this reason, it is ever more important that it remains as independent as possible.
The state of Mississippi, ever the leader in regressive policies, was the first state in 1832 in which judges were required to be elected as per their state constitution. Of twenty-one state constitutions written between 1846 and 1860, nineteen included provisions which established the popular election of judges. By the start of the Civil War, the total number of states electing judges reached twenty-one out of thirty (Kermit 372).
What brought about this strong trend? One might point the blame towards Jacksonian Democracy. In an effort to reign in control of the government from the elitists and put it back into the hands of the people (assuming you were a white male), Jacksonian Democracy reignited a democratic fervor among its supporters. This populist movement stressed the idea of the “common man” electing judges instead of political elites appointing them. As the Second Party System emerged, this particular issue was one of several at the forefront of many platforms. During this period, voter participation was historically high and the democratic spirit was arguably as strong as it had ever been in the United States of America.
Paradoxically, many of these first generation of elected judges saw themselves as strengthening judicial independence and protecting the rights of the minority from the strength of the majority. Not surprisingly, America’s experimentation with judicial elections has not be adopted by any where else in the world; this is despite the countless list of other attributes of our system of government which have influenced others (Shugerman 1069).
The U.S. judicial system still suffers to this day from the hang over brought about by this wild exercise of democratic excess. This hang over was diagnosed prematurely by Alexis de Tocqueville, in his work titled Democracy in America:
Some other state constitutions make the members of the judiciary elective, and they are even subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict that these innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal consequences; and that it will be found out at a future period that by thus lessening the independence of the judiciary, they have attacked not only the judicial power, but the democratic republic itself.
While Tocqueville may have sang some praises about various aspects of our system of government, judicial elections did not escape his critique.
While the influence of money in American politics is certainly disturbing, the particular influence of money in judicial elections is outrageous. A judge, as expressed by Hamilton, is to be chosen based on their merit and not on how many hands they shook at country club fund raisers.
Watching a television ad for a judicial candidate makes me feel like I am watching a skit on Saturday Night Live. Judicial campaigns are riddled with absurdity. If a candidate can raise enough money, they can essentially purchase a seat on a bench for life. Federal campaign contribution laws, albeit slowly being dismantled by the Supreme Court as of late, do not apply to many of these state elections. It is not uncommon for judicial campaign contributions to not be limited in amount by law.
What state laws that do exist to protect the independence of judiciaries are subject to attack by opposition. In Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment rights of a potential judicial candidate were violated by the state’s announce clause which prohibits potential judges from expressing their views on controversial issues which may come before them. Like attempting to place a piece of duct tape across the first crack in the Titantic‘s hull, this is but a minor effort to thwart the laundry list of negative aspects inherit in judicial elections.
While implications of this decision will only directly impact the nine states with an announce clause, the long-term indirect impact it will have on judicial elections is yet to be seen. One of the more immediate indirect result of this case is the trend across the country of more lawsuits being filed against states with similar rules that were not necessarily covered by the Supreme Court decision. Once again, this was a 5-4 decision with Kennedy joining the conservative majority. A case to prevent partisanship in judicial elections was decided by a partisan Supreme Court. Let that sink in.
Poor Jane. She should have spent more time at her local country club.
What about the influence of campaign donations? In 2006, the New York Times conducted a study of the Ohio Supreme Court and concluded that campaign donations heavily influence judges decisions. Ohio Supreme Court Justice Terrence O’Donnell, facing a tough re-election, received donations from various businesses and political action committees. While this is not itself unusual in this country, it is the fact that after the election he decided two cases which happened to be in favor of two companies that contributed generously to his campaign (NYT).
The catalyst for this study was an Ohio appeals court decision handed down a year before. The court invalidated a $212 million jury verdict against the Telxon Corporation. After investigating, it became known that the judge who wrote the decision, William G. Batchelder, received large sums of contributions from Robert Meyerson, Chief Executive Office of Telxon Corporation.
It was not until 2009 that the United States Supreme Court ruled that an elected judge must recuse themselves from a case involving a campaign contributor in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Company. The court argued that not doing so violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Like many recent important Supreme Court cases, this was decided along partisan lines in a 5-4 decision with Kennedy joining the liberal majority. The case even inspired write John Grisham’s work, The Appeal. Grisham joked that all he had to do to get an idea for his next novel was to read The Charleston Gazette, which covered the story extensively.
It is not at all difficult to find other examples of campaign contributions ultimately deciding judicial elections. The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana conducted a study of Louisiana district court elections from 1990 to 1994 which showed that “seventy percent of contested elections are won by the candidate who spent the most money” (Cleveland III 393).
Ninety percent of state judges in the United States of America are subject to popular vote, a quality not shared by any other advanced democracy. David Pozen wrote in the Columbia Law Review about the irony of judicial elections as a tool for accountability. This involves voters having a firm idea of what they expect a judge to do and using this to decide if they get another term or not. Unfortunately, there is no one shared ideal of gauging a judge’s performance so this accountability tool quickly becomes self-defeating.
While voter emotions and lack of information is listed alongside campaign contributions as two strong arguments against judicial elections, it is important to note that these two are not mutually exclusive. It is one that preys on the other. In this case, it is campaign contributions that capitalize on voter emotions and the general lack of the application of reason when selecting candidates to vote for.
If a particular judicial election is influenced one way or the other by party battles in Congress or a political scandal, then it is not truly independent. If a particular judicial election is influenced one way or the other by campaign contributions, then it is not truly independent. How much further shall the judicial branch sway from the realm of independence into that of a judiciary in the pockets of millionaires? Hopefully, reform will come soon to this flawed institution that is unique to our country.

Leading health psychologist DR MEG ARROLL reveals how to get good sleep

The modern day sleep dilemma: Tech and stress are driving millions of us to insomnia – but these tips by leading health psychologist DR MEG ARROLL could help you snooze easy
Leading psychologist specializing in health says Dr Meg Arroll on behalf Healthspan says our modern lives have outrun our sleep needs
We need to change our sleep model to match the world we currently live in and let of go of our obsession with ‘perfect’ sleep
The focus should also be more on what we do in the day, than night-time routine
By Dr Meg Arroll For Dailymail.com
Published: 20:35 GMT, 15 March 2019 | Updated: 03:32 GMT, 16 March 2019
Dr Meg Arroll, a health psychologist who has suffered from insomnia herself, explains ways to fix your waking hours so you get good sleep
There’s not a day in my working life that I don’t speak to people who say they’re tired all the time and don’t get enough sleep.
I myself have suffered from bouts of quite severe insomnia in the past and it’s one of the most destructive influencing not only on daily functioning, but also long-term health if not tackled.
One of the main problems we have with sleep is that our physiology hasn’t evolved as fast as the technology we now rely on.
We are still mere mammals but living in a world that far outpaces our ability to rest properly.
This is why the focus for a solution to the Modern Day Sleep Dilemma cannot just concentrate on bedtime – it’s something we need to attend to during a complete 24-hour day cycle.
Here’s how:
1. Let go of sleep perfection
We live in a world of constant self-evaluation – we count our steps, look carefully at the nutritional content of food, and now we somewhat obsessively measure our sleep quality with smartphones and apps.
There’s a real downside to this, especially when it comes to sleep.
Night-time wakings can in themselves cause anxiety, as we stress about how much sleep we’re getting (or not getting), whether it’s a solid eight hours and if not, the mental and physical health implications.
In other words, a preoccupation with sleeping well can lead to insomnia.
The fact of the matter is that we can and do survive on less-than-perfect sleep – ask any parent.
While it may not be ideal, and certainly long-term severe sleep disturbance is associated with a range of health problems, it’s important for us to let go of sleep perfection.
A study which followed over 800 people for two years found that those with persistent insomnia had higher levels of perfectionism than good sleepers.
Therefore, unless daytime sleepiness is negatively affecting your ability to function, ditch the sleep tracker and let go of sleep perfectionism.
2. Focus more on what you’re doing in the day, not at night
How well we sleep really has more to do with our daytime lives than the hours of darkness.
The modern world is full of stimulation – before we had electricity there was a limit on the amount of productive activity that could be accomplished at night. This of course has resulted in huge booms in economies and raised living standards – but there is always another side to any coin.
We find it very hard to switch off, literally and figuratively, so it’s no surprise that sleep is difficult for many of us.
Professionals often suggest a sleep hygiene routine – e.g. making sure your room is dark and cool, avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and screens several hours before bed, winding down, etc. – but if it was this simple, we’d all be sleeping like logs.
These practices can certainly help, but we also need to make sure we’re supporting our natural circadian rhythm in the daytime.
3. Boost natural light rather than fear artificial light
Our natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian rhythm is covered by natural light. However, the vast majority of us spend almost all of our waking hours indoors.
The next big product in wearable technology will be a light sensor – about the size of a small coin – that will tell us when we need to go outside to get more natural light.
Researchers from the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute exclusively study the way light impacts us as individuals, our environments and health.
They are one of the pioneers of this new wearable tech and say that if we receive sufficient natural light during the day, we won’t be as sensitive to artificial light at night-time.
Therefore, we should pay a little more attention to the natural light during daytime hours, as well as controlling screen-time.
Many people spend too either too much or too little time in bed – both of which can make us feel exhausted during the day
The next big thing in wearable tech will be daylight sensors – we’re all very aware (and often very concerned) about artificial light before bedtime, but if we receive enough natural light during the, we won’t be as sensitive to screen-emitted light. These new wearables will ping and nudge you to go outdoors during the day to make sure you’re getting enough daylight to support your circadian rhythm.
4. Slumber-boosting vitamins & supplements
Another benefit of getting out in the daylight is vitamin D – our bodies convert sunlight into this essential vitamin, which is why in the wintertime between 30-40 percent of Brits are deficient in vitamin D. As well as stocking up on foods high in vitamin D such as oily fish and mushrooms, you can take a supplement such as Healthspan’s vitamin D.
Dr Sarah Brewer, Medical Director advises: ‘Sleep is when your body carries out vital repairs, replenishes proteins and regenerates cells. It is important to get not too much or too little, but just the right amount.
‘When researchers followed 21,000 twins for over 22 years they found a clear association between longevity and sleep duration.
‘Those twins who habitually slept for between seven and eight hours per night lived longer than those who tended to sleep for shorter or longer amounts.
‘If you are experiencing sleep difficulties or waking feeling unrefreshed, try taking cannabidiol CBD oil – a cannabis extract that is not psychoactive, is perfectly legal, but by a quality one that has been approved by the CTA (Cannabis Trade Association) and can really improve sleep quality.’
Magnesium is involved in the production of melatonin which is our natural sleep-inducing hormone.
A study involving 46 older people with sleep problems showed that taking 500mg magnesium a day for eight weeks significantly improved melatonin levels, sleep time, and sleep efficiency, compared with placebo, with a reduction in early morning waking.
Magnesium also acts as a muscle relaxant and magnesium bath salts added to a warm bath before bedtime are virtually guaranteed to induce a good night’s sleep as magnesium is absorbed through the skin.
Herbal sleep remedies may help such as Valerian root and Hops extracts.
Valerian has been shown in studies to aid sleep without the side effects that drug therapy may produce (feeling groggy, unrefreshed, ‘hungover’ feeling, etc.). This liquid herbal tincture and may also be helpful to beat jetlag as it encourages natural sleep – it’s definitely worth a try for people who really struggle with jetlag but don’t want to resort to pills.
5. Work back from your wake time
Ideally we’d get up when we naturally wake, but of course with having to work, take kids to school and all the other demands on our lives this is rarely possible.
Many people spend too either too much or too little time in bed – both of which can make us feel exhausted during the day.
The former is most likely because their sleep quality is poor, whereas the latter is due to lack of sleep.
The average adult needs approximately seven to nine hours a night. A common pattern when people start to experience sleep troubles is they go to bed early, thinking this will remedy the tiredness.
However, what often happens is the body’s ‘sleep drive’ – the physiological pressure for sleep – isn’t yet at tipping point. This means either problems falling asleep, or more likely staying asleep.
Waking at around 3am-4am is a frequently reported disturbance here. And the solution is to actually spend less time in bed, rather than more.
On the other hand, some people ‘sleep procrastinate’, watching TV or scrolling through smartphones until late in the night.
For both of these problems you can work back from your wake time.
So if you have to get up at 7am, try going to bed at 11pm. Make sure to keep all devices out of the bedroom though to limit sleep procrastination.
This way you should also be able to ditch the snooze button. Being startled awake, then falling back to sleep numerous times is a repeated cardiac assault. By working back from your wake time and getting into this routine, it’s much more likely that you’ll feel rested well enough not to be tempted to hit snooze.
In sum…
While it won’t hurt to ditch the booze and after dinner coffee before bed, cool down the bedroom and make sure it’s nice and dark, in our modern lives it’s also important to support the circadian rhythm but getting as much natural light as possible, avoiding sleep perfection and procrastination and working with, not against our wake times.

What is Health Informatics?
Health informatics studies methods and resources for the management of health information. This discipline is comprised of information science, healthcare and computer science. Health Informatics is also known as Health Information Systems, HealthCare Informatics, Medical Informatics, Nursing Informatics, Biomedical Informatics and Clinical Informatics.
Healthcare Informatics utilizes resources, methods and devices in order to optimize acquirement, storage, retrieval and usage of health and biomedical information. Health Informatics involves multiple systems such as electronic health records, electronic medical records, health information exchange standards, medical terminology and portable medical devices for the collection of data.
Tools Used in Health Informatics
Various tools are used in the field of Health Informatics. These include computers, formal medical terminologies, information and communication systems, clinical guidelines and more. Health Informatics can be applied to the following areas:
• Nursing
• Dentistry
• Pharmacy
• Clinical Care
• Public Health
• Physical Therapy
• Occupational Therapy
• Biomedical Research and more…
Health Informatics Sub-Areas
Several categories fall under the umbrella of Health Informatics, such as:
1. Clinical Informatics – This area is concerned with how clinicians use information in the health care system. Health Informaticians in this area can improve health care by analyzing, creating, implementing and evaluating medical systems, which enhance health outcomes, improve patient care and help to build the patient-clinician relationship.
2. Computational Health Informatics – This is a branch of Computer Science that handles computer-related techniques pertinent to healthcare. Using computers to analyze medical data and various topics is an example of Computational Health Informatics.
3. Clinical Research Informatics – Also known as CRI, Clinical Research Informatics takes the core principals and technologies used in Health Informatics and combines them with clinical research contexts. CRI has exploded over the past few years due to growing clinical research information and data.
Health Informatics Programs and Job Outlook
There are many types of Health Informatics programs and certifications throughout the world. Many universities and colleges offer a M.S. in Health Informatics degree or some type of Health Informatics certification, for those who want to add a specialty to their current degree. The need for Health Informatics Technicians is expected to increase by 21 percent up until 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, landing it in the “faster than average” category regarding job growth.
Health Informatics Expert, Dr. Steven R. Gerst
Dr. Steven R. Gerst is Dean Emeritus of the Masters of Science Program in Applied Health Informatics at Bryan University (Los Angeles, Sacramento, Toronto and Phoenix) where he serves on the Board of Advisors and teaches on the faculty. Dr. Gerst also serves as an Adjunct Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine.
Currently, Dr. Steven R. Gerst most recently has been Vice President,one of the leading clinical decision software companies in the nation.

Trump Healthcare Act – Differences and Consequences
Health Insurance April 12, 2018
It is no secret that the United States has always had issues with its healthcare system. It was always incredibly expensive and denied coverage to those who most needed it. When Obamacare came to help those people out, it raised the premiums for those it did not aid. Now, the Trump administration has its own plan to “fix” these issues.
An interesting fact is that the US spends a lot of money on health (more than any other OECD member state), but Americans are simply not well covered. Maternal healthcare in the United States is literally worse than in Iran and Libya.
So, now, after being elected for (among other reasons) promising that he will replace the Obamacare, on his inauguration day, Trump finally signed the executive order to start disassembling President Obama’s plan.
At this point, we will not go into the debate about whether or not Obamacare was a good or a bad plan. Instead, we will try to focus on the changes that Trump is making to healthcare in America. The document is already colloquially known as Trumpcare, even if the actual name is the American Health Care Act.
Now, let’s go through the biggest changes that are coming with this act.
Tax credits to help with buying insurance
The idea of the Republicans is that the healthcare should be controlled by the market and not by the government. They decided to offer refundable tax credits to help people switch to Trumpcare. Those who do not have insurance through their jobs can get $2,000 if they are younger than 30 and up to $4,000 if they are older than 60. The wealthiest people will not be eligible for the credit.
No more fines for those who do not have insurance
One of the bigger issues Americans had with Obamacare was that you had to be insured; if you refused, you faced fines. Under Obamacare, large companies were also facing fines if their employees were not insured. However, insurance companies will now be allowed to charge a whopping 30 percent premium if the cover can lapse for nine weeks or more.
Trumpcare will remove the limits on health care savings
Those who live in the United States will now have the option of almost doubling the amount of money that they can save up in their healthcare accounts. Obamacare had limits on the savings. The American Health Care Act will also allow people not to be insured. Aso, larger companies with a lot of employees will no longer need to ensure the people who work for them.
Further cuts to women’s care
Planned Parenthood will have its funding cut. As we should know by now, Planned Parenthood receives federal funding while providing women specific care. They offer abortions, which is a controversial topic, but Planned Parenthood also offers cancer screenings and contraception.
Trumpcare gives the control to insurance companies
Companies that offer insurance will have full freedom in setting their own prices. This, unfortunately, means that older people will be at a bigger risk of losing their insurance as Obamacare limited the amount of money they could be charged, which was set at triple the amount younger customers paid.
Some people estimate that the insurance companies will now increase that figure to up to five times larger.
Medicaid will also be slowly rolled back. As we know, it was a program that used funds to help disabled and deeply impoverished people have insurance.
Things that stay the same
— Young people (younger than 26) can still be covered by their parents’ insurance.
— Those who have previously diagnosed conditions will still be entitled to the coverage.
— Every company that provides health insurance will still have to offer ten health benefits. This includes maternity care and various preventative services.
— These companies will still not be allowed to set a limit o how much they have to pay up for coverage.
The cost of Trumpcare
Well, nobody still knows. Unfortunately, the American Health Care Act doesn’t give us any solid numbers, and it is still pretty much guesswork. However, it stands to reason that although the prices will definitely change, for better or for worse remains to be seen.

Commentary: Senator Lindsey Graham Makes A Great Point
January 7, 2019 January 7, 2019 Ohio Star Staff	
by CHQ Staff
Ever since the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings Senator Lindsey Graham has been on a roll, and his appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday was a great example.
Graham warned that the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding cannot end as long as the “radical left” insists on reflexively calling Republicans racist for supporting immigration officials.
Democrats who want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and deride Border Patrol agents for using tear gas hold too much power in the ongoing shutdown negotiations, Graham said.
“We’re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE,” Graham said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday. “We’re having to negotiate with people who see border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers.”
He continued: “And we’re negotiating with people who will accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists. As long as the radical left is in charge, we’re not going to get anywhere. … The goal is to fix a broken immigration system, to bring reality to this table.”
Sen. Graham is right but fixing our broken immigration system or safeguarding the border is the last thing the Democrats are interested in now that Donald Trump is President.
Recall that in 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the San Ysidro port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities.
Nevertheless, prominent Democrats lined up to hammer the administration shortly afterwards, as images of migrants fleeing tear gas fumes circulated. New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who has also called for ICE to be abolished, called the use of tear gas “horrendous.”
Of course, Sen. Gillibrand is running for President, so she can be expected to say anything to put herself to the Left of the other 20 Democrats who have floated their names as Trump’s 2020 opponent.
However, as Lukas Mikelionis of Fox News pointed out, the leading Democrats who are not running for President are no better.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has become a fervent critic of Trump’s immigration policies. Earlier this year he snubbed an immigration reform proposed by the White House that would have allowed nearly two million so-called “Dreamers” to become U.S. citizens while providing $25 billion for border wall and security.
“This plan flies in the face of what most Americans believe,” Schumer tweeted, adding that Trump uses the young immigrants “as a tool to tear apart our legal immigration system and adopt the wish list that anti-immigration hard-liners have advocated for years.”
But in 2009, Schumer took the exact hardline view. “First, illegal immigration is wrong … and a primary goal of comprehensive immigration reform must be to dramatically curtail future illegal immigration.”
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, just as Schumer, has taken a radically different position in the past.
During a 2008 press conference, Pelosi addressed the “challenge” of illegal immigrants and said “we certainly do not want any more coming in.”
“Do we have a commitment to secure the border? Yes. What are the options that we have available to us, let’s make sure they work,” Pelosi said.
“Because we do need to address the issue of immigration and the challenge we have of undocumented people in our country. We certainly do not want any more coming in.”
In 2013, Pelosi reiterated her support for the border security, urging the House to vote for a bill that “our basic principles” such as securing “our borders.”
But despite her previous views, both Schumer and Pelosi slammed Trump for highlighting the issue of immigration and the caravan heading to the U.S.
“The president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about,” their statement read.
Senator Graham told “Face the Nation” that, “Right now, the people running the show on the left are radical liberal Democrats who don’t see a border security problem, they see their own government being the problem… There’s a deal to be had here, but it will include a wall.”
Senator Graham went on the say, “We’ll have offers on the table when we find somebody that’s not crazy to deal with…” judging by what the Democrats’ leaders are saying it looks to us like it is going to be a long shutdown, if it can’t end until someone who is not crazy represents them at the negotiating table.

Senator Graham is exactly right about this however, I personally have a problem with believing his sincerity here. Just two years ago Graham was one of the gang of eight, which helped many to give him the name Lindsey Grahamnesty. He only started really coming around to conservative principles during the Kavanaugh Confirmation.

Colin Kaepernick, 49ers players keep pressure on NFL owners
Quarterback files grievance and some former teammates continue to protest two days before league meetings

HYATTSVILLE, Maryland — Two days before the NFL moves to finally tackle the divisive issue of players protesting during the national anthem, the player who started the leaguewide movement alleged that owners have colluded to end his career and his former team continued to demonstrate in hopes of pushing management to help bridge the nation’s racial divide.
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first sat and then kneeled last season in an effort to draw attention to racial injustice in the U.S., filed a grievance under the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement alleging that owners have conspired to keep him out of the league. The still-unemployed quarterback took the action without help of the NFL Players Association. Meanwhile, owners and other top NFL decision-makers readied for the two-day meetings scheduled to begin Tuesday in New York City, at which commissioner Roger Goodell is expected to unveil a detailed plan to support players who have demonstrated peacefully for more than a year over issues critically important to African-American communities. Here at FedEx Field, seven members of the 49ers, the franchise that has been the most politically active, protested under the direction of veteran safety Eric Reid, who was the second person to kneel alongside Kaepernick.

Just another day in the NFL ever since Kaepernick took a stand that he believes derailed his career. Instead of pursuing a grievance through the union, as many players do, Kaepernick hired attorney Mark Geragos, who has represented many high-profile candidates, including Michael Jackson and rhythm and blues artist Chris Brown. The filing was first reported by Bleacher Report.
Activist-players and civil rights leaders have blasted the league for, in their opinion, sidelining Kaepernick only because of his political views. They’ve cited Kaepernick’s win-loss record and other statistics in arguing it’s obvious that the talented passer is being blackballed. On Sunday, a large crowd assembled at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore to support Kaepernick before the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Chicago Bears. In August, a crowd estimated at more than 1,500 people gathered in front of NFL headquarters in New York to show their support for the person who has become the face of the new battle for civil rights.
For his part, Kaepernick has mostly remained silent and continued training in hopes of joining a team this season. But with the league in Week 6 and Kaepernick having been repeatedly passed over for jobs by far less-accomplished passers, it has become clear that, at only 29, his time in the NFL is likely over. In an email Sunday night to The Undefeated, Geragos wrote that the grievance was filed “only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives” to get Kaepernick back in the game.
The email continued: “If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful protest — which the owners themselves made great theater imitating weeks ago — should not be punished and athletes should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the Executive Branch of our government,” alluding to President Donald Trump, who blasted Kaepernick and many NFL and NBA players for their work on behalf of others. “Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation. Protecting all athletes from such collusive conduct is what compelled Mr. Kaepernick to file his grievance.”
Anyone can file a grievance. Winning is another matter.
Kaepernick faces a major challenge, according to Susan D. Carle, a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. Carle, an expert in discrimination, labor and employment law, said Kaepernick must show that the NFL violated his rights.
“He would have to show that each of the teams, that they didn’t just on their own decide not to sign him but that at least two of them somehow had a communication and said, ‘We’re not going to pick him because he’s trouble. Let’s just kind of blackball him,’ ” Carle said Sunday. “He would have to have some evidence to show that. If he couldn’t show any communication between at least two teams, it would be really hard to make the claim.
“It doesn’t have to be a written memo. It could be an oral communication that somebody’s willing to testify about. If he had an ally on one of the teams who could say, ‘Yeah, I heard these [officials from two teams] say we’re going to stay away from him.’ That could be enough. … But there are reasons to bring the claim even if he’s going to lose. He could bring it just to keep the heat on the NFL.”
At FedEx Field, the 49ers didn’t let up on owners.
Reid explained that the group of 49ers protesters was smaller than usual — before the team’s previous two games, more than 20 players took a knee each time — because of his mistake in communicating what the team’s approach should be before facing the Redskins. FedEx Field is only about 15 miles from the White House. Reid is among the leaders of the movement frustrated that opponents of their efforts, including President Trump, have framed their actions as being disrespectful to the flag, the military, and the government and its institutions in general. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence cut short his attendance at an Indianapolis Colts-49ers game after several players on the visiting 49ers dropped to one knee. After the anthem, the former governor of Indiana and his wife abruptly left Lucas Oil Stadium.
“I was considering, since we’re in the nation’s capital, standing to finally put to bed the accusations that we don’t respect the military,” Reid said Sunday after the 49ers dropped to 0-6. “I did a poor job getting back to all the guys and saying, ‘We’re just continuing the message. We’re going to kneel and keep saying it’s not about disrespecting them.’ ”
Despite the smaller protest, Reid was nonetheless pleased that the 49ers again took action in advance of the NFL meetings. The players’ association also is expected to participate in the meetings, and Reid hopes that the NFL “will be progressive and utilize [its] platform to bring awareness to these issues for us so we don’t have to protest anymore. That would be the ultimate goal for me going into the meetings.”
Since late last season, activist-players have privately expressed concerns that the protests threatened to obscure their larger message. If the league finally hears them and is ready to fully support their causes, well, that’s great news, Reid said.
“We just want progress to be made on these issues,” he said. “When Colin and I started protesting, it was to raise awareness. The goal of the meetings would be to continue to raise awareness. To raise awareness, but just doing it through the NFL platform” moving forward.
From all appearances, the NFL is ready to go all in.

Recently, Detroit Lions owner Martha Ford asked players to stand for the anthem. In return, she promised to financially support the players’ causes. Goodell, in a letter to owners last week, stressed the need to both “promote the work of our players on core issues” and end the divisiveness over the protests that threaten “to erode the unifying power of our game.” Some players are highly encouraged about their ongoing dialogue with the league, and eager for the meetings to start.
No matter what occurs at the meetings, though, the issue of what has happened to Kaepernick, the person who started all of this, will always be a sore point with some.
“It sure does seem that he’s being blackballed,” said Reid, who remains close with his former teammate. “All the stats prove that he’s an NFL-worthy quarterback. That’s his choice [to file a grievance], and I support his decision. We’ll just have to see what comes of it.”
Jason Reid is the senior NFL writer at The Undefeated. He enjoys watching sports, especially any games involving his son and daughter.

Congress and the Dangerous Drive Towards Creating a Military State | Andy Worthington

Congress and the Dangerous Drive Towards Creating a Military State
20.7.11
“Some issues,” the New York Times declared in an editorial on June 25, “require an unwavering stand. Preserving the role of law enforcement agencies in stopping and punishing terrorists is one of them. This country is not and should never be a place where the military dispenses justice, other than to its own.”
Fine words, indeed, although the Times itself has, over the last ten years, in common with most, if not all of the American establishment, failed to thoroughly and repeatedly condemn efforts, first by George W. Bush, and then by the Obama administration, to hold military trials for the mixed bag of soldiers and terrorist suspects held at Guantánamo.
This is where the rot set in, for which everyone in a position of authority, whether in politics or the media, bears responsibility. However, the failure to stem the poison flowing from this wound to the established order — in which terrorists are criminals, and soldiers are not terrorists — has led to an outrageous situation in which lawmakers (both Republicans and Democrats) have decided that the aberrations introduced by the Bush administration, which should, by now, have been thoroughly discredited, were, instead, just the first steps in the creation of an all-encompassing military state.
In this dystopian future, coming to America within months, if lawmakers are successful, anyone regarded as a terrorist must be held in military detention, where, it is planned, they may be subjected to abuse with impunity, and, if required, held forever without a trial and without any rights.
This was the aberration initially dreamt up by Bush and his close advisors for their “War on Terror,” and implemented at Guantánamo, throughout the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, and around the world in a network of secret prisons, but although it should have died as an enduring concept when President Obama took office, it took less than a year for supporters of military detention for terror suspects to start proposing its continuation and expansion, suggesting that no foreign terror suspect should ever receive a federal court trial.
None of the cheerleaders for military detention cared that, throughout the eight years of the Bush administration, the detention program in the “War on Terror” was actually a failure as well as an aberration, which had struggled to try just three men, because the correct venue for terrorist trials was in federal court, where hundreds of successful trials took place.
Instead, when, in November 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder announced a federal court trial in New York for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks, the cheerleaders for military detention began mobilizing against the trial, starting a successful backlash that encouraged the administration first to freeze the proposal, and then, this year, to officially abandon it in favor of a military trial at Guantánamo.
This was a disgrace — and Eric Holder knew it, if no one else — but what no one in the administration foresaw was how Obama’s steady capitulation to pressure would embolden his critics to make ever more outrageous demands. Six weeks after the 9/11 trial announcement, when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian, was apprehended in Detroit after trying — and failing — to blow up a plane with a bomb in his underwear, the cries went up for him to be sent to Guantánamo and subjected to waterboarding, not read his Miranda rights, interrogated non-coercively by FBI agents, and tried in a federal court.
The critics did not have their way, although they did persuade the ever-compliant President to abandon releasing any more cleared Yemenis from Guantánamo, issuing a temporary moratorium that is still in place a year and a half later. This has contributed enormously to the stalemate at Guantánamo — where 171 men remain, even though 89 have been approved for transfer — and has created ill-feeling in Yemen, where the President has, effectively, judged all Yemenis as potential terrorists.
Even more crucially, the empowerment of Obama’s critics led inexorably to further attempts to dictate policy. There had been attacks on the President’s power before, through legislation preventing any prisoner from being brought to the US mainland for any reason except to face a trial, and through moves to prevent the President from closing Guantánamo by buying a prison in Illinois and moving the prisoners there. However, in December last year lawmakers went further than before.
In passages inserted into the annual defense authorization bill, lawmakers banned the use of funds to bring any Guantánamo prisoners to the US mainland — even to face trials — and specifically mentioned Khalid Sheikh Mohammed by name. They also banned the use of funds to buy a prison on the US mainland for the Guantánamo prisoners, and prevented the President from releasing any prisoner unless the defense secretary signed off on the safety of doing so. This provision was designed specifically to prevent the release of any prisoner cleared by the President ‘s own interagency Guantánamo Review Task Force to countries regarded by lawmakers as dangerous, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen.
These passages were an unwarranted and unconstitutional assault on the President’s powers, as even Conservative commentators recognized, but Obama again failed to challenge his critics. This reinforced them to such an extent that, in May, when dealing with this year’s defense authorisation bill, lawmakers in the House of Representatives responded to the news of the assassination of Osama bin Laden not by declaring an end to the “War on Terror,” but by insisting that the basis for that war — the Congress-approved Authorization for Use of Military Force, passed the week after the 9/11 attacks — should be renewed and made even more sweeping.
They also renewed their attacks on the President’s ability to transfer prisoners to the US mainland to face trials, his right to release prisoners to other countries without jumping through hoops, and his right to review prisoners’ ongoing detention without Congressional interference, according to his March 7, 2011 Executive Order authorizing the indefinite detention without charge or trial of 47 of the remaining Guantánamo prisoners. That order had already enraged those on the other end of the political spectrum, who recognized that it was Obama’s official extension of the heart of Bush’s own discredited detention policies.
Also included in the attacks was, for the first time, a fundamental assault on the President’s right to prosecute foreigners seized in connection with terrorist offences in federal court, also without interference from Congress.
The problems with the defense authorisation bill first came to light at the end of May, when the President’s advisors finally responded to “provisions that challenge critical Executive branch authority” by stating that, “If the final bill presented to the President includes these provisions … the President’s senior advisors would recommend a veto.”
That was important, but although the endless expansion of the “War on Terror” was dropped as an aim, as a result of concerted pressure from opponents, the Senate Armed Services Committee was fundamentally undaunted, and last month unveiled its plans for the mandatory military detention of terrorist suspects. As the New York Times explained in its dissenting editorial:
Republicans and Democrats are championing bills to further militarize the prosecution of terrorists, beyond anything even President George W. Bush proposed. They want Americans to believe the legislation will keep the country safer. In fact, these bills could end up tying the hands of FBI agents and other law enforcement officials trying to disrupt terrorist plots. They are likely to deprive prosecutors of their most powerful weapons in bringing terrorists to justice. And they come perilously close to upending the prohibition, which dates back to Reconstruction, against the military’s operating as a police force within the United States.
The Times also noted, correctly, that there was “no sign” that the White House had “tried to stop” the House of Representatives from “passing a particularly awful version of these bills, which would move most, if not all, terrorism cases from civilian courts to military tribunals,” or had “tried to stop” the Senate Armed Services Committee “from approving only a slightly better one.” The editors also had no time for complaints by Democrats on the Committee, who include Sen. Carl Levin, that “they defeated far worse proposals,” and made it clear that “President Obama must push the Democratic leadership to amend the Senate bill — and make it clear that he will veto any bill that turns over proper law enforcement functions to the military.”
While this situation continues to fester, with only the threat of a veto standing in the way of a dangerously militarized state, another development — the uproar over the administration’s proposal to try an alleged Somali terrorist, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, in federal court in New York — has kept the advocates of military detention busy, even though the Warsame case actually raises a whole set of other troubling issues.
Before his arrival in New York to face a trial, Warsame had been held on a ship, in military custody, since April 19. As a result, the most troubling question ought to concern this two-month period off the books, whereas the military detention crowd has obsessed instead about how President Obama has been involved in what 23 Senators, led by John McCain and Mitch McConnell, described last week in a letter as an action that “appears to be a circumvention of the clear intent of many in Congress that terrorists captured abroad under the Authorization for Use of Military Force should not be brought into the United States for trial.”
Perhaps this will play into the hands of the Obama administration, in which federal court trials are seen as the correct venue for terrorist trials, even though Obama is himself responsible for having revived the military trials at Guantánamo in the first place, when he should have left them alone. This latest development — the letter from the 23 Senators — certainly doesn’t show lawmakers in a favourable light, as they continue, obsessively, to flog their pet topic.
If people are paying close attention, they may finally realize how deranged the advocates of military detention sound, although they should, of course, have been wary in the first place of the military being given powers that correctly belong to the law enforcement agencies, and especially of proposals that anyone accused of terrorist activities in the US must be held in military detention.
That way extreme danger lies — very possibly of the kind that led to the US “enemy combatant” Jose Padilla losing his mind in a US military brig during his ordeal of solitary confinement and torture between 2002 and 2005 — and if that is understood, then the correct focus in the Warsame story might become clear. That is to ask, ten years after ships were used to hold prisoners seized after the invasion of Afghanistan, at the start of the so-called “War on Terror,” why a ship has now been used to hold, for several months, a prisoner seized in connection with another conflict — in Somalia — in which the United States is not even officially involved.
In addition, it is also worth asking why, two and a half years since the end of the Bush administration, we are hearing once again about how a prisoner held outside the law had his first interrogations sessions — conducted under unspecified circumstances — followed by non-coercive interrogations by FBI agents, which were designed to secure evidence for a federal court trial. As the Associated Press described it, Warsame “was interrogated at sea by intelligence officials,” and it was only later that the FBI stepped in and “began the interrogation from scratch, in a way that could be used in court.”
Under Bush, the follow-up interrogators, after the torture had taken place, were openly referred to as “clean teams” — as they were in February 2008 when Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his alleged co-conspirators, held for years in secret CIA torture prisons, were first put forward for military trials. If we are back in the dirty world of torture, that is even more chilling than the persistent attempts by lawmakers to establish a militarized state.

Great idea, Kristin. And thanks, Colin. The problem now, however, is certainly with those Democrats who cannot locate their spines in the face of Republican criticism, but more importantly with all those of whatever party in Congress (mostly Republicans) who are trying to rewrite the rules of war — who to detain and how, and how to try them — with exactly the kind of disregard for internationally acceptable norms (and the norms of US history) as though Bush and Cheney were still in power and America was facing a critical existential threat every minute of its existence. People need to wake up, smell the cynical fearmongering and fight back.

According to the ACLU, there are real threats to American citizens – not just mythical foreign “terrorists” – in the amendments to the Defense Authorization Act as written by the Armed services Committee.
From the ACLU:
[the changes would]
* authorize the federal government to imprison indefinitely without charge or trial civilians — including American citizens— apprehended both inside and outside the United States, including individuals who had no role in the 9/11 attacks or any actual hostilities (the bill would mark the first time since 1950 that Congress explicitly authorizes the detention without charge or trial of American citizens)
* mandate military detention of some civilians who would otherwise be outside of military control, including civilian suspects apprehended within the United States itself
* transfer to the Department of Defense core prosecutorial and investigative responsibilities now held by the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Marshals Service, as well as by the state attorneys general of the 50 states.
These provisions could significantly cut back on the historic protections provided to American citizens by the Non-Detention Act of 1971 and to all U.S. residents by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878…

Ross Worthington, M.D. says...
This is a nice description of some of the American insanity when it comes to “terrorism.” Of course the obvious problem with how the US deals with this so called war is that it creates more terrorists. But no one really wants to address that because there is also money to be made. The military industrial state essentially controls the media and congress. The things you write cannot be understood by “average” Americans as it creates too much cognitive dissonance. Go USA! Right?

Hi Ross. “The things you write cannot be understood by ‘average’ Americans as it creates too much cognitive dissonance.” Now if only it wasn’t the fascist types who have all the soundbites … I do keep trying: “Americans, your leaders are lying to you! Wake up and smell the cynical fearmongering, and don’t trust your corporate masters. They’re only in it for themselves!”

I’m sharing this now, and will Digg it later. This is, I think, one of your most strongly worded articles. For good reason, I’d say, since you discuss three things that are crucial: exactly what should Obama and his supporters have put their feet down to, exactly why was a ship used in an initial interrogation (if there was an interrogation), and just how far can the supporters of military detention go, and towards what, before any group of Democrats have enough moral (not just political) backbone to resist whatever bad things are opted for. These are precisely the issues most on my mind, although I do not have your command of the facts and legislative details. So I’m indebted to you for having written this.

Are some people eating different food or drinking different water from me? Are they being brainwashed somehow? or did the aliens take over while I wasn’t watching?
...on July 20th, 2011 at 11:00 pm
Andy Worthington says...
Perhaps the latter, Regina. They still look like human beings, but they’ve been hollowed out and replaced with something else, something completely inert, or completely self-reflecting. It doesn’t get any easier the more I recognize that I am surrounded by people who are asleep when it comes to genuinely understanding what’s going on. Because those who do understand recognize that they need to act — to speak up, to agitate, to write, to talk to people, to publicize and combat the fact that our countries are now run by crooks of a magnitude that we haven’t seen since the Middle Ages, when, yes, most of us were serfs.
And we are now sleepwalking back to serfdom.

And Congress is out of control, Louise. The plans to prevent Congress declaring an all-out open-ended war on anyone and anything may have been averted, but, as with those dark years under Bush when American citizenss — Jose Padilla and Yasser Hamdi — and US resident Ali al-Marri were held and tortured on the US mainland in military custody, the American people are unconcerned that a new bunch of madmen want “terrorists” to be imprisoned by the military, and essentially outside the law.

Yes indeed, Louise. That as well. The list of crimes grows ever longer, and Obama has ended up “owning” all of this and doing something Bush couldn’t: making it seem official policy by the time his term in office comes to an end. We have until November 2012 to make sure that truly dreadful policies have been repealed, and, realistically, only until January to really make noise about them without hardcore Dems accusing us of treason. It’s looking bleak …

No, I wish they would wake up, we need them to vote out this horrible excuse for a government and Congress in the USA and we need the acolyte nations, like Britain and Australia (and a long list of others) to get enough spine to say no to the failing Empire.

Absolutely, Wiily, yes. We need our own people to see clearly that what our leaders offer for our future is war, repression and the unfettered greed of the few, and that what we need is something completely different. We have imagination and creativity in our countries, which is being wasted, and which could be harnessed for the benefit of humanity, at a time when we need creative thinking.
First, though, what you accurately call “the failing Empire” needs to be recognized, challenged and defeated.

Quarterly Fundraiser: Help Me Raise $2500 for My Work on Guantánamo and Torture | Andy Worthington

Quarterly Fundraiser: Help Me Raise $2500 for My Work on Guantánamo and Torture
5.9.11
Please support my work!
On the eve of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 that precipitated the “War on Terror” that has consumed my life for the last five and a half years, through my work chronicling the illegality and the human cost of the Bush administration’s cruel and misguided response to those attacks, it is, I’m rather astonished to note, three months since I last reached out to you, my readers and my supporters, to ask you to provide some financial support to help me to continue my work.
Every three months I ask for donations to help me maintain my existence as a journalist working mainly in the new media, combining traditional journalism (paid for by those who publish it) and reader-funded journalism (supported directly by my readers) as a viable model for a writer in 2011. My last appeal in June — for $2,000 — was thoroughly successful, and with the help of 36 wonderful friends, readers and supporters (and my apologies if I didn’t manage to thank you all personally!), I succeeded in raising that amount, and, with donations received over the summer, exceeding my expectations.
As a result, I’m putting out an appeal for $2,500 this quarter. This is not a vast amount of money, and nor is it enough to live on, but if those who enjoy my work provide me with $10,000 a year then I am less reliant on the vagaries of the freelance world, and can pursue the kind of research and analysis that I have been undertaking since May, when, after liaising with WikILeaks on the release of previously classified military files from Guantánamo, I began a colossal project chronicling all the prisoners in Guantánamo, adding information from these files to what was already known, to create “The Complete Guantánamo Files,” a 70-part series of articles, totalling at least 700,000 words, for which I have currently completed the first 17 parts.
This project, which is taking up most of my time from now until the end of the year, is partly funded by one of the organizations that supports my work, but not to the extent necessary to make it viable and self-supporting financially, and so, if you can help out at all, please click on the “Donate” button above to make a payment via PayPal.
All contributions are welcome, whether it’s $25, $100 or $500. Readers can pay via PayPal from anywhere in the world, but if you’re in the UK and want to help without using PayPal, you can send me a cheque (address here — scroll down to the bottom of the page), and if you’re not a PayPal user and want to send a check from the US (or from anywhere else in the world, for that matter), please feel free to do so, but bear in mind that I have to pay a $10/£6.50 processing fee on every transaction. Securely packaged cash is also an option!
In return, I promise to continue shining a light on the dark corners of the United States’ activities since 9/11, and also, when possible, to comment on other stories that have proven of interest to my readers — primarily, the revolutionary movements in the Middle East, the ongoing global financial crisis, and the appalling political state of the UK under a Tory-led coalition.
Over the next three months I will also be working with a number of organizations and concerned individuals on plans to raise the profile of Guantánamo, and the 171 prisoners still held, for the 10th anniversary of the prison’s opening, on January 11, 2012.
This is a terrible anniversary that, when President Bush left office and Barack Obama took over, seemed to be one that would be marked by the closure of Guantánamo and the restoration of America as a nation ruled by law, in which the arbitrary detention of foreigners in an offshore prison would no longer be tolerated, and those who were responsible for creating Guantánamo and redefining and authorizing torture would be held accountable for their actions.
That did not happen, of course, and so the long road to justice and accountability has grown longer still, but with your help I will continue to call for accountability and a return to the rule of law, and to demonstrate why both remain necessary.
As always, it is good to have you with me, and without your support, of course, my work means nothing.

P.S. On a more prosaic note, I also need donations to secure some technical support for my site, as my security was recently compromised. This is a less glamorous side of the expense of running a website and working in the new media, but it is, of course, of vital importance, as cyberthreats continue to proliferate.
Andy Worthington is the author of The Guantánamo Files: The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America’s Illegal Prison (published by Pluto Press, distributed by Macmillan in the US, and available from Amazon — click on the following for the US and the UK) and of two other books: Stonehenge: Celebration and Subversion and The Battle of the Beanfield. To receive new articles in your inbox, please subscribe to my RSS feed (and I can also be found on Facebook, Twitter, Digg and YouTube). Also see my definitive Guantánamo prisoner list, updated in June 2011, details about the new documentary film, “Outside the Law: Stories from Guantánamo” (co-directed by Polly Nash and Andy Worthington, on tour in the UK throughout 2011, and available on DVD here — or here for the US), my definitive Guantánamo habeas list and the chronological list of all my articles.

I wasn’t able to pay with paypal, I think because it does not recognise my email address. My Gmail is routed through the Netherlands, where many government and other certificates were falsified electronically about two days ago. Gmail was one victim, and I cannot connect with various sites. All sorts of rumours are flying about, mainly, “Iran did it,” without a shread of public proof, just accusations. Very weird cyberattack.

Hi George, that’s funny, because I’ve just received a donation from you via PayPal! Thanks very much, and thanks also to the other friend who, in the last few hours, has also made a donation to keep me hard at work.

Having said that, George, I’m sorry to hear about the cyberattack. That sounds troubling. I wouldn’t have known about it had you not mentioned it:

That’s it. The public isn’t being told a thing, yet Iran gets suddenly blamed. Well, I got 1. a certification that I donated to you (25 USD) and 2. A message from Pay Pal saying that the contact could not be made. I used Gmail. So, to play safe I turned off the function that lets money be taken out in another country. No problem, I’ll figure something out. ALL accounts, gmail, yahoo, atc are in trouble. My problem started two nights ago, when I tried to use CHROME to reach a UK site. Same result.

Andy Worthington says...
Well I’m very grateful for all the effort you went to to make a donation to me, George. Thanks again. It really is troubling, though, if there’s a major problem with so many accounts, as you’re saying, and on a national or trans-national level.

George Kenneth Berger wrote:
Andy, I don’t even know if all accounts are in trouble. Gmail definitely is. I read about yahoo and others in some Dutch paper this morning. The problem concerns “certificates.” These are programs at the receiving end that recognise (or don’t) that I am a legit user of that end’s server. *These* were falsified en masse. This means that a fake certificate recognises me, but leads me to a phony site that looks just like the original. Then I send *them* cash, thinking I sent it to you. So, I either lost 25 USD, or you got it, or I closed my system before some crook got my money. This is *trivial.* Major problems are for government services, such as the tax people. Then people lose a lot. The government posts warnings, but says nothing.
...on September 5th, 2011 at 10:45 pm
Andy Worthington says...
I got it, George. I checked with PayPal, but this is a huge and important story, isn’t it? Certificates falsified en masse at government level, leading consumers to scamming websites disguised to look like they’re real?!?

It might be. I just warned a FB friend in Amsterdam. She could not reach the Chamber of Commerce and was wondering what was going on. So some sites have been closed off temporarily. I knew that this morning.

I just looked at the English article you posted. I don’t like the purely circumstantial yet suggestive evidence it presents. All other texts I’ve seen are similar, yet yours mentions the self-immolation affair and diplomatic difficulties. That is not evidence, just suggestion.

Andy, it turns out that my failure to connect with a server in the UK was due to some problem with that server, not with the Dutch issue. I don’t know what caused the difficulty with Pay Pal, but since you got my contribution it was probably just a glitch at Pay Pal, unrelated to the Dutch hack. I was concerned, since I sent the money while news of the certificate falsifications was prominent.
...on September 8th, 2011 at 1:00 pm
Andy Worthington says...
Well, that’s good to know, George, although it’s still alarming to hear about hacking at a government level that is not then adequately reported.
...on September 8th, 2011 at 1:01 pm

George Kenneth Berger wrote:
Well, as I understand it, the attack was on the computer of a private firm that the government used. That’s bad enough in my book, since the firm might have had shabby and/or cheap security. I haven’t looked at the news in Dutch for several days, but I will do my best to check.
...on September 8th, 2011 at 1:14 pm
Andy Worthington says...
Exactly, George. Governments really do need to be aware of the threat on an everyday level – and that involves choosing who to work with. Perhaps we’ll discover that it was a bunch of charlatans who put in a cheap bid!
...on September 8th, 2011 at 1:14 pm

George Kenneth Berger wrote:
That’s what I thought but didn’t want to say out loud. Perhaps not charlatans, but a firm working on the cheap, headed by people who know little about information technology and security, and staffed by indifferent, poorly paid and perhaps poorly educated technicians. Then there’s the additional strong possibility that the bosses did not wish to spend much money on necessary, periodic, checks and updates. It’s typical of what one gets when taxes are lowered, a service is outsourced, and the job is out of sight of the departments which, I hope, employ a few better technicians.
Or better yet, “outsourced” within the country, and the rules relaxed by deregulation and privatisation of the service. With the possible exception of privatisation, that is what happened to me, thanks to KPMG, which took over a government function that stood in the way of the privatisation of Dutch insurance.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump unceremoniously dumped Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet on Tuesday and picked CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place, abruptly ending Tillerson’s turbulent tenure as America’s top diplomat and escalating the administration’s chaotic second-year shake-up.
Tillerson was ousted barely four hours after he returned from an Africa mission and with no face-to-face conversation with the president, the latest casualty of an unruly White House that has seen multiple top officials depart in recent weeks. Citing the Iran nuclear deal and other issues, Trump said he and Tillerson were “not really thinking the same.”
“We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters at the White House - a diplomatic take on a fractious relationship that included reports that Tillerson had privately called the president a “moron.”
In an illustration of the gulf that has long separated Tillerson and Trump, aides to both couldn’t even on agree on the circumstances of his firing.
Undersecretary of State Steve Goldstein and other State Department officials said that Tillerson hadn’t learned he was dismissed until he saw Trump’s early-morning tweet, and hadn’t discussed it directly with the president. Goldstein said the former Exxon Mobil CEO was “unaware of the reason” he was fired and “had had every intention of staying,” feeling he was making progress on national security.
Hours later, Goldstein was fired, too.
Multiple White House officials said that Tillerson had been informed of the decision Friday, while he was in Ethiopia. One official said chief of staff John Kelly had called Tillerson on Friday and again on Saturday to warn him that Trump was about to take imminent action if he did not step aside, and that a replacement had already been identified. When Tillerson didn’t act, Trump fired him, that official said.
All of the officials demanded anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

Blackwater Dodges Taxes
Tax Evasion or Fraud
Combat Support Associates,
CSA
dodges taxes for a decade
WASHINGTON (AP) — When the
Pentagon announced an obscure
California company had won a lucrative
military contract, no one mentioned any
plans for a Caribbean outpost — a
tropical shell the company quickly
created that allowed it to duck millions
in taxes and deflect U.S. lawsuits.
It's legal, at least for now. Contractors
large and small have been heading
offshore to shield piles of taxpayer
dollars, according to an Associated
Press investigation, but irate
lawmakers are thundering that they'll
put an end to it.
Almost a decade ago, a few months
after winning the deal that has totaled
more than $2 billion, Combat Support
Associates established its subsidiary in
the Cayman Islands, a British territory
and tax haven.

MPRI dodges taxes
Shell Firms Shielded Contractor
Boston Globe May 4 2008
by Farah Stockman
full story here
WASHINGTON - In March 2005, one
of the Pentagon's most trusted
contractors - Virginia-based MPRI,
founded by retired senior military
leaders - won a $400 million contract
to train police in Iraq and other
hotspots. Two months later, MPRI
set up a company in Bermuda to
which it subcontracted much of the
work.
It was not the first time that MPRI
executives had used a shell
company in an offshore tax haven to
perform government-funded work. A
year earlier, MPRI headed a joint
venture that won a $1.6 billion
contract to provide US
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo and
elsewhere. Three months later, MPRI
set up a company in the Cayman
Islands to do the work.
Like MPRI's Bermuda subsidiary, the
Cayman Islands company appears
to have no phone number, website,
or staff of its own there.
Blackwater Dodges Taxes
IRS CIRCULAR 230 NOTICE: To
ensure compliance with
requirements imposed by the
IRS, we inform you that any U.
S. tax advice within this
website is not intended or
written to be used, and cannot
be used, for the purpose of (i)
avoiding penalties under the
Internal Revenue Code
Special Note:
If your company is not paying their part of your SS and Medicare Taxes then
you are not an employee, they cannot claim you as an employee when they
purchase the DBA insurance they are required to get in order to even get the
government contracts.
In the Blackwater case for instance it would seem they are either guilty of tax
evasion or have fraudulently mis represented their independent contractors as
employees so that they could acquire the mandated DBA Insurance.
The first $92,900 (for 2011) you make is said to be "tax free". There are still
the social security and medicare taxes to pay on wages up to $106,800. These
taxes will amount to 15%+ of your wages if you are classified as a contractor. If
you are classified as an employee your employer is responsible for paying for
half of these.
Merely labeling a worker as an independent contractor is not enough. They
must actually be an independent contractor.
If you do misclassify an employee as an independent contractor, you must pay
the IRS all back-taxes owed, plus interest, plus penalty (12% - 35% of the total
tax bill).
Unlike an employee who is limited to workers' compensation benefits, an
independent contractor can sue you for negligence if they're injured on the job.
DETERMINING WHETHER JOE IS AN EMPLOYEE OR AN
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
Unfortunately, as far as the various government agencies are concerned, there is not one
single test that determines whether Joe is your employee or an independent contractor. Even
more difficult, it is quite possible that for the purposes of one government agency Joe is
considered to be an independent contractor while for another he is
treated as an employee.
=> The IRS/Common Law "Control" Test
The IRS follows the common law "control" test for determining whether someone is an
employee or independent contractor. This test looks at 20 factors as being indicative (and
only indicative) of whether the person is an employee or independent contractor. The test
basically involves a balancing of these factors -- which way does the scale tip?
Here are the IRS factors:
1. Whether the worker can earn a profit or suffer a loss from the activity (if so, the more likely
it is that the worker is an independent contractor).
2. Whether the worker is told where to work (indicative of employee status).
3. Whether the worker offers his or her services to the general public (indicative of
independent contractor status).
4. Whether the worker can be fired by the hiring firm.
5. Whether the worker furnishes the tools and materials needed to do the work (indicative of
independent contractor status).
6. Whether the worker is paid by the job or by the hour (independent contractors are more
likely to be paid by the job; employees by the hour).
7. Whether the worker works for more than one firm at a time (indicative of independent
contractor status).
8. Whether the worker has a continuing relationship with the hiring firm (indicative of
employee status).
9. Whether the worker invests in equipment and facilities (indicative of independent
contractor status).
10. Whether the worker pays his or her own business and traveling expenses (indicative of
independent contractor status).
11. Whether the worker has the right to quit without incurring liability (indicative of employee
status).
12. Whether the worker receives instructions from the hiring firm (indicative of employee
status).
13. Whether the worker is told how to perform the work (indicative of employee status).
14. Whether the worker receives training from the hiring firm (indicative of employee status).
15. Whether the worker performs the services personally.
16. Whether the worker hires and pays assistants (indicative of independent contractor
status).
17. Whether the worker sets his or her own working hours (indicative of independent
contractor status).
18. Whether the worker provides regular progress reports to the hiring firm.
19. Whether the worker works full-time for the hiring firm (indicative of employee status).
20. Whether the worker provides services that are an integral part of the hiring firm's
day-to-day operations (indicative of employee status).
It is important to note that none of the above factors are, of themselves, determinative. The
IRS will balance all of the factors to determine which side of the equation is favored.
Internal Revenue Service
Independent Contractors vs. Employees
Before you can determine how to treat payments you make for services, you must
first know the business relationship that exists between you and the person
performing the services. The person performing the services may be -
An independent contractor
A common-law employee
A statutory employee
A statutory nonemployee
In determining whether the person providing service is an employee or an
independent contractor, all information that provides evidence of the degree of
control and independence must be considered.
It is critical that you, the employer, correctly determine whether the individuals
providing services are employees or independent contractors. Generally, you must
withhold income taxes, withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, and
pay unemployment tax on wages paid to an employee. You do not generally have to
withhold or pay any taxes on payments to independent contractors.
Caution: If you incorrectly classify an employee as an independent
contractor, you can be held liable for employment taxes for that worker,
plus a penalty.
Who is an Independent Contractor?
A general rule is that you, the payer, have the right to control or direct only the result of the
work done by an independent contractor, and not the means and methods of accomplishing
the result.
Example: Vera Elm, an electrician, submitted a job estimate to a housing complex for
electrical work at $16 per hour for 400 hours. She is to receive $1,280 every 2 weeks for the
next 10 weeks. This is not considered payment by the hour. Even if she works more or less
than 400 hours to complete the work, Vera Elm will receive $6,400. She also performs
additional electrical installations under contracts with other companies, that she obtained
through advertisements. Vera is an independent contractor.
How should I report payments made to independent contractors?
You may be required to file information returns to report certain types of payments made to
independent contractors during the year. For example, you must file Form 1099-MISC,
Miscellaneous Income, to report payments of $600 or more to persons not treated as
employees (e.g. independent contractors) for services performed for your trade or business.
For details about filing Form 1099 and for information about required electronic or magnetic
media filing, refer to information returns.
Who is a Common-Law Employee (Employee)?
Under common-law rules, anyone who performs services for you is your employee if you can
control what will be done and how it will be done. This is so even when you give the
employee freedom of action. What matters is that you have the right to control the details of
how the services are performed.
To determine whether an individual is an employee or independent contractor under the
common law, the relationship of the worker and the business must be examined. All
evidence of control and independence must be considered. In an employee-independent
contractor determination, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and
degree of independence must be considered.
Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three
categories: behavioral control, financial control, and the type of relationship of the parties.
Refer to Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide for additional information.
Who is an Employee?
A general rule is that anyone who performs services for you is your employee if you can
control what will be done and how it will be done.
Example: Donna Lee is a salesperson employed on a full-time basis by Bob Blue, an auto
dealer. She works 6 days a week, and is on duty in Bob's showroom on certain assigned
days and times. She appraises trade-ins, but her appraisals are subject to the sales
manager's approval. Lists of prospective customers belong to the dealer. She has to
develop leads and report results to the sales manager. Because of her experience, she
requires only minimal assistance in closing and financing sales and in other phases of her
work. She is paid a commission and is eligible for prizes and bonuses offered by Bob. Bob
also pays the cost of health insurance and group-term life insurance for Donna. Donna is an
employee of Bob Blue.
Statutory Employees
If workers are independent contractors under the common law rules, such workers may
nevertheless be treated as employees by statute ( statutory employees ) for certain
employment tax purposes if they fall within any one of the following four categories and meet
the three conditions described under Social security and Medicare taxes , below.
A driver who distributes beverages (other than milk) or meat, vegetable, fruit, or bakery
products; or who picks up and delivers laundry or dry cleaning, if the driver is your agent or is
paid on commission.
A full-time life insurance sales agent whose principal business activity is selling life insurance
or annuity contracts, or both, primarily for one life insurance company.
An individual who works at home on materials or goods that you supply and that must be
returned to you or to a person you name, if you also furnish specifications for the work to be
done.
A full-time traveling or city salesperson who works on your behalf and turns in orders to you
from wholesalers, retailers, contractors, or operators of hotels, restaurants, or other similar
establishments. The goods sold must be merchandise for resale or supplies for use in the
buyer s business operation. The work performed for you must be the salesperson s principal
business activity. Refer to the Salesperson section located in Publication 15-A, Employer s
Supplemental Tax Guide for additional information.
Statutory Nonemployees
There are two categories of statutory nonemployees: direct sellers and licensed real estate
agents. They are treated as self-employed for all Federal tax purposes, including income
and employment taxes, if:
Substantially all payments for their services as direct sellers or real estate agents are directly
related to sales or other output, rather than to the number of hours worked and
Their services are performed under a written contract providing that they will not be treated
as employees for Federal tax purposes.
Refer to information on Direct Sellers located in Publication 15-A, Employer s Supplemental
Tax Guide for additional information.
Misclassification of Employees
Consequences of treating an employee as an independent contractor. If you classify an
employee as an independent contractor and you have no reasonable basis for doing so, you
may be held liable for employment taxes for that worker. See Internal Revenue Code section
3509 for additional information.

Taxes for Expats
Combat Zone Pay
Exclusion Applies Only to
Members of the US Armed
Forces
by Tax Prof Blog
The Tax Court yesterday held
that a Florida man who earned
$98,400 in 2005 working for
Blackwater (since renamed Xe)
providing security services to
the U.S. Army in Iraq could not
exclude the compensation from
income under § 112 as “combat
zone compensation of members
of the Armed Forces.
Holmes v. Commissioner,
T.C. Memo. 2011-26 (Jan.
31, 2011)
The Tax Court concluded that
the taxpayer did not serve in the
Armed Forces of the United
States but instead was a private
citizen hired by and paid by a
private company (Blackwater).
The Tax Court refused to
impose a penalty because the
taxpayer relied on an IRS
memorandum wrongly stating
that civilian personnel in direct
support of combat zone military
operations qualified for the §
112 exclusion. (Hat Tip: Bob
Kamman.)
Class Action Tax Misrepresentation Filed Against Xe/Blackwater
Scott Bloch blasts Blackwater on behalf of thousands of former employees who
were mistreated and denied employee benefits, unemployment and other
withholding based on a fraudulent misclassification as independent contractors
Special note:
The IRS has been targeting civilian contractors as a result of the improprieties
of Blackwater, Ronco Consulting, and others.
Pursuant to an IRS internal memo Memorandum Number: AM2009-0003
Also note that the IRS page to which you link has an important note regarding the
definition of a foreign tax home (which is necessary to claim the Sec 911 benefit).
The IRS has been using this in somewhat of a distorted way to deny the FEIE to
contractors working in Iraq and Afghanistan,, not only those who have families in the
U.S., but also single people who left home, joined the military and then were hired as
contractors.
If they did not plan in advance and take all the steps necessary to show that their abode
was in a foreign country and not in the U.S. they are disallowing the exclusion.
Many have had inexperienced tax preparers or did their own tax return and the case
dragged on so long that they lost their administrative appeals rights and facing a
substantial tax bill plus penalties cannot afford a good tax attorney to take it to Tax Court.
As a result, the IRS is using their muscle to claim that these workers were living on a
base and had no contact with the local community and therefore their “abode-which is
not clearly defined anywhere) was in the U.S.
This is the quote from the IRS page:
Tax Home
Your tax home is the general area of your main place of business, employment, or post
of duty, regardless of where you maintain your family home.
Your tax home is the place where you are permanently or indefinitely engaged to work
as an employee or self-employed individual. Having a “tax home” in a given location
does not necessarily mean that the given location is your residence or domicile for tax
purposes.
If you do not have a regular or main place of business because of the nature of your
work, your tax home may be the place where you regularly live. If you have neither a
regular or main place of business nor a place where you regularly live, you are
considered an itinerant and your tax home is wherever you work.
You are not considered to have a tax home in a foreign country for any period in which
your abode is in the United States . However, your abode is not necessarily in the
United States while you are temporarily in the United States . Your abode is also not
necessarily in the United States merely because you maintain a dwelling in the United
States , whether or not your spouse or dependents use the dwelling.
“Abode” has been variously defined as one's home, habitation, residence, domicile, or
place of dwelling. It does not mean your principal place of business. “Abode” has a
domestic rather than a vocational meaning and does not mean the same as “tax home.”
The location of your abode often will depend on where you maintain your economic,
family, and personal ties.
Example 1.
You are employed on an offshore oil rig in the territorial waters of a foreign country and
work a 28-day on/28-day off schedule. You return to your family residence in the United
States during your off periods. You are considered to have an abode in the United
States and do not satisfy the tax home test in the foreign country. You cannot claim
either of the exclusions or the housing deduction.
Example 2.
For several years, you were a marketing executive with a producer of machine tools in
Toledo , Ohio . In November of last year, your employer transferred you to London ,
England , for a minimum of 18 months to set up a sales operation for Europe . Before
you left, you distributed business cards showing your business and home addresses in
London .
You kept ownership of your home in Toledo but rented it to another family. You placed
your car in storage. In November of last year, you moved your spouse, children, furniture,
and family pets to a home your employer rented for you in London .
Shortly after moving, you leased a car and you and your spouse got British driving
licenses. Your entire family got library cards for the local public library. You and your
spouse opened bank accounts with a London bank and secured consumer credit. You
joined a local business league and both you and your spouse became active in the
neighborhood civic association and worked with a local charity.
Your abode is in London for the time you live there. You satisfy the tax home test in the
foreign country.
Note that the IRS agents examining these returns are not seasoned international agents
and their internal directive is to disallow the exclusion regardless of the taxpayer’s
defenses and force it to go to Tax Court.
I have seen many contractors who came to me for help but by that time it was just too
late to help as they needed a tax attorney that they could not afford.

Increasing Audits When Claiming Foreign Income Exclusion
By I.J. Zemelman, EA, Taxes for Expats Jan-2-2013
IRS audits on those who claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) are becoming
more frequent. If you receive a letter or phone call stating an intention to conduct an
audit, refrain from engaging with the auditor directly and contact Taxes for Expats right
away.
Just as any competent lawyer will advise you to not talk to the police - we will advise you to not
directly talk to the IRS. Just as you would rely on us to prepare your US expat tax return you should
also rely on us to handle an audit on your behalf. By entrusting your audit to a professional who
can competently discuss your tax return with the IRS you are essentially guaranteeing a smoother
audit with better results.
Why You Should Work With a Professional
Why is it best to have a professional tax adviser conduct an audit on your behalf? The most
compelling answer is that certain situations are open to interpretation by the auditor and can lead
to poor results if not presented from a logical and legal standpoint.
For example, if you were stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan and claimed the FEIE as a bona fide
resident, the IRS may argue that you failed to meet certain qualifications for the bona fide
residence test such as a permanent long-term residence. If such a determination is made, your
claim for the FEIE will be disallowed and you will be forced to re-file – paying taxes on your entire
worldwide income. We wrote an whole article that explains this - How to not get caught off-guard by
the IRS when claiming the Bona Fide Residence Test.
You may have a considerable amount of people telling you that they claimed FEIE annually as a
bona fide resident without any negative consequences and that may be true. What you have to
consider, however, is that your circumstances may be different (since you are being audited - that
is already established). More likely - they may not actually qualify as a bona fide resident and have
just been getting lucky. After all - the IRS doesn’t have to catch everybody - they will be happy to
catch only some and make an example. Either way, you should have a professional representative
on your side who speaks the same language as the IRS auditor.
Claiming FEIE Under Physical Presence Test
If you claim the FEIE under the physical presence test, be aware that certain IRS locations require
your primary residence to be outside of the United States to qualify. This can pose a problem for
individuals who have been working and living overseas for at least 330 days who should be able to
claim the FEIE under the physical presence test.
Unfortunately, the definition of a qualifying ‘abode’ is ambiguously defined in the US tax code and
the IRS is relying on an outdated court ruling to determine that your home is where your social and
economic ties are maintained. If your family and the rest of your life are in the United States and
you are working in a foreign country, you may be at risk of having your FEIE disallowed because of
this loophole. As a US Expat claiming the FEIE under the physical presence test, your tax return
has a 5-10% chance of being selected for an audit.
It’s important to understand that all audits are handled differently and each auditor has his or her
own set of rules in regard to what will be allowed and what will not be allowed on a US expat tax
return. This is another reason why it’s important to have a seasoned professional on your side
that has experience dealing with variable auditors.
Based on historical and trending IRS auditing procedures, we will outline below some of the most
important aspects of the tax code and take a look at how it affects you as a US Expat.
Form 673
We will first take a look at Form 673. Many taxpayers believe that Form 673 is required to claim
the FEIE or that filing Form 673 qualifies you for this deduction. Both of these beliefs are false;
Form 673 has nothing to do with the FEIE. Form 673 simply exempts you from tax withholding.
The problem with filing Form 673 to avoid having taxes withheld, however, is that many employers
tend to add the cost of various travel, meal, or cost of living reimbursements to your total taxable
income, in turn causing you to be taxed on income you never received.
Use Form W-4 Instead
Rather than filing Form 673, the most effective method of having fewer taxes withheld from your
regular pay is to file Form W-4 with your employer and claim a large number of dependents on this
form on line 5. If you select between 9 and 15 dependents, there will probably be a sufficient
withholding to cover the taxes you owe at the end of the year. If you believe you will wind up owing
no taxes at all on your US expat tax return, you may claim up to 99 dependents or write ‘exempt’ as
a means of dropping the amount withheld from your payroll to close to zero.
Track Your Deductions
Be sure to maintain records of all work-related expenses, as these are all valid deductions which
may be itemized and claimed on your US expat tax return. Expenses such as food and lodging,
travel, uniforms and protective armor, automobile, telephone, computer, postage, medical and a
variety of others may be itemized and claimed as a US deduction. Rather than saving and
depending on receipts to calculate your deduction at the end of the year, get in the habit of
keeping a detailed spreadsheet to track your deductible expenses.
Pick Your Battles (States) Wisely
If you maintain a residence in the United States, it’s best to keep a residence in a tax-free state (if
possible) such as AK, FL, NV, SD, TN, TX, WA, and WY. If you have a residence in AL, CA, HI, or
PA you will have a hard time escaping state tax liability. Furthermore, if you live in one of these 4
states, you will not be able to use the FEIE to decrease your taxable worldwide income. If you
maintain a residence in another state in which state taxes are imposed, see if you have the option
of claiming residency in one of the tax-free states mentioned above.
Most importantly in case of an audit, make sure to keep all tax related documentation that you
receive. Items such as W-2s, 1099s, and any other documents you receive which have information
about tax relevant items such as property taxes, mortgage interest payments, investment income
and other types of income and deductible expenditures.
Remember that the best way to stay off the radar with the IRS is to file on time. Generally speaking
as a US Expat returning to the United States from a combat zone, you have 180 days upon
returning to file missing tax returns with no penalty. If you are living and working in another country
and are not under the constant threat of war, you are required to file an annual US expat tax return
from your place of residence before the established deadline. If you have failed to file or you are
facing an audit for a previously filed tax return, make sure to contact Taxes for Expats before you
do anything else.

Biggest Challenge for Cybersecurity Executive Order: Herding All the Cats
3/07/2013 02:44:00 PM Cynthia Brumfield No comments
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is about to testify today before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Govermental Affairs regarding the President's February 12 cybersecurity executive order. As I've mentioned in the past, the cybersecurity scene in Washington is a labyrinth and the recent EO only promises to make it much more so.
By my reckoning there are 15 government departments, agencies or offices responsible for implementing it, each to varying degrees. They are:
Administrator of General Services
Attorney General
Department of Agriculture (Named via Sector Specific Agency references)
Department of Commerce's NIST
Department of Defense
Department of Energy (Named via Sector Specific Agency references)
Department of Health and Human Services (Named via Sector Specific Agency references)
Department of Homeland Security
Department of the Treasury (Named via Sector Specific Agency references)
Director of National Intelligence
Environmental Protection Agency (Named via Sector Specific Agency references)
Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council
National Security Agency
Office of Management and Budget
Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board
And the order covers 16 critical infrastructure industries. They are:
Chemical
Commercial Facilities
Communications
Critical Manufacturing
Dams
Defense Industrial Base
Emergency Services
Energy
Financial Services
Food and Agriculture
Government Facilities
Healthcare and Public Health
Information Technology
Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste
Transportation Systems
Water and Wastewater Systems
If I were on the Homeland Security Committee, I'd be asking a lot of questions about how DHS plans to herd all these cats through the labyrinth on such a complex subject. Stay tuned for an update on the hearing itself.

ECOWAS advances 10-year investment plan on emerging agric issues	
and gender aspects of agriculture, towards the promotion of food security in West Africa.
Director of Environment, ECOWAS Commission, Dr. Johnson Boanuh, who disclosed this at a 2-day Consultative Regional Committee for Agriculture and Food workshop, said the new or second generation RAIP, precedes the commission’s initial 5-year plan, which aimed at identifying agricultural excesses in the region, and ensuring distribution of the excesses to areas within countries and the region that suffer food shortages.
With the plan, which runs from 2016 to 2025, the region has identified seven emerging agricultural issues global-wise, new ideas, and aims to integrate these issues into the plan for perusal and adoption by ECOWAS members state’s Ministers of Agriculture.
According to Boanuh; “with the current plan, we will consider various gender groups, the nutrition aspect-an important aspect that will help us produce nutritionally balanced foods, that address a lot of health challenges, ensuring people are fed at the right time, with the right food, which prevents diseases.
“It also factors in the effects of climate change on food production and availability. Climate Change has become an emerging global issue. Therefore, we are paying serious attention to climate smart agriculture-which looks at how to make our agriculture responsive to climate challenges.”
To guarantee an encompassing approach, ECOWAS has helped member countries in establishing National Agriculture Investment Plans (NAIP), which dovetails with the RAIP. Funds are mobilised by member states government, and with development partners within the states, as well as, across the region.
Boanuh also said that ECOWAS has set up a Regional Agricultural Agency, located in Lomé, Togo, where mobilised funds will be managed by the agency and made available to various national groups to assist in the improvement of their agricultural productivity.
Identifying the successes of the five-year RAIP plan, Boanuh added that there has been a general increase in cereal production, agriculture information systems, animal husbandry and animal health approaches.
He however, noted that only member states could identify their peculiar successes, via productivity increase, within the last five years.

Gun Storage Laws Could Apply in Shooting by Toddler
Posted on Monday, February 11, 2019 at 8:45 am CST
If so, the father in the case could end up facing felony criminal charges and a potential jail sentence. According to a February 3, 2019 WKBN news report, the incident occurred as the 27-year-old, eight-months pregnant mother and her boyfriend were laying in bed watching television. Their four-year-old son was also in the room. He retrieved a loaded, unsecured gun that the father kept under the mattress. The toddler pointed the weapon at the mother and pulled the trigger, hitting her in the face. After transportation to the Harborview Medical Center reports of life threatening injuries were discovered. Police have an open investigation to determine charges in accordance with the states newly passed gun storage laws.

A Breakdown of the Green New Deal
Posted on Tuesday, February 05, 2019 at 2:28 pm CST
The longest U.S. government shutdown in history has finally ended, which means it's time for Congress to roll up their sleeves and get back to work on the pressing issues at hand. Foremost in the minds of many legislators is what has been coined the 'Green New Deal' (GND for short). The Green New Deal isn't a single piece of proposed legislation, but rather a name that refers to any of several proposed economic stimulus programs that attempt to address both economic inequality and climate change.

Solutiant, a Leader in Technology Infrastructure, Is Now Offering Cutting-Edge Public Safety DAS
Posted on Friday, December 28, 2018 at 9:53 am CST
When a disaster strikes a building, the only thing that ensures the safety of people inside is their seamless communication with people outside such as first responders. Without knowing the situation of a building from inside, first responders, including firemen and police officers, cannot take necessary actions with accuracy. During the tragedy of 9/11, firefighters and police officers were not able to communicate properly inside the World Trade Center due to disrupted communication channels which led to so many casualties. Since then, NFPA and IFC fire codes made it mandatory for every building to have an enhanced communication system utilizing Public Safety DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems). This is the reason that Solutiant now provides top-notch Public Safety Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) DAS and Indoor Cellular DAS systems.

NSW Upper House supports Constitutional Recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
March 20, 2013
Jan Barham, Greens MP and spokesperson for Aboriginal Affairs, has welcomed the passage of her motion supporting Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples by the NSW Legislative Council.
“The passage of the Act of Recognition through the Senate last week was another important step toward Constitutional Recognition, but it is crucial that politicians across all Parliaments and parties help build support for a referendum,” Ms Barham said.
“The Parliament passed an amendment to the NSW Constitution in 2010, and now the upper house has thrown its support behind constitutional change for Australia. I hope the Premier and his Government will work toward ensuring public support for Constitutional Recognition.”
The motion that was passed by the Legislative Council also recognised the contributions of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians, along with community organisations such as Recognise, for their work in establishing the path toward a Commonwealth Referendum.
“It is a credit to the dedication of many people and organisations that Indigenous recognition has finally been achieved in the Commonwealth Parliament. The next step is for everyone who supports Constitutional change to make their voice heard,” Ms Barham said.
“I encourage all MPs across our states and territories to seek their Parliament’s expression of support for Constitutional Recognition. A demonstration that our politicians across all parties support a ‘yes’ vote would help to ensure that this referendum would see support as strong as at the Indigenous referendum in 1967.”
“Now is the time for everyone who cares about this issue to make their voice heard. People should contact their elected representatives and ask them to commit their public support to Constitutional change.”
NSW Legislative Council Hansard, 19 March 2013 – Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians:
Motion by the Hon. JAN BARHAM agreed to:
1. That this House notes that:
(a) the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 was passed by the Commonwealth House of Representatives on 13 February 2013 and passed by the Senate on 12 March 2013,
(b) the bill provides parliamentary recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first occupants of Australia, and acknowledges their continuing relationship with their traditional lands and waters and their continuing cultures, languages and heritage,
(c) the bill establishes a process of review of support for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution, and
(d) the bill was passed with multiparty support.
2. That this House:
(a) recognises that the continent and the islands now known as Australia were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,
(b) acknowledges the continuing relationship of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with their traditional lands and waters, and
(c) acknowledges and respects the continuing cultures, languages and heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
3. That this House acknowledges the work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians and community organisations such as Recognise in establishing the path toward a Referendum on Constitutional Recognition.
4. That this House expresses its support for constitutional change for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia’s Constitution.

DES MOINES, Iowa - Donald Trump was a no-show for the final Republican debate before Monday's Iowa presidential caucuses, not just physically absent from the stage but also barely mentioned by seven candidates who are fighting to deny him the party's nomination. It was an unreal moment in what has been an unreal campaign.
The evening offered an almost perfect reflection of the state of the Republican race, with Trump occupying his own space and the rest of the candidates competing with one another to emerge as his principal rival. In his absence, the other hopefuls struggled with only limited success to distinguish themselves as the best of the rest.
What might have been a lively and spirited evening turned into a mostly tepid affair, one that neither stoked the anti-establishment disaffection that has been so talked about throughout the campaign nor provided energy to Republican voters on the eve of the caucuses. Trump may have lost little by skipping the debate - unless Iowans feel used by his feud with Fox News.
The two candidates with the most to gain were Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Cruz is battling Trump for first place in Iowa. Rubio is looking for a strong third-place finish as a way to separate himself from the other mainstream conservatives in the race. But instead of seizing the moment, both Rubio and Cruz found themselves under attack and on the defensive.
Both sought to square past statements and votes with their claims that they now oppose amnesty for immigrants who are in the United States illegally. Each sought to undermine the other, and both came under attack from the others on stage. The exchanges reinforced how muddled and fluid the Republican race remains as the voting is about to begin.
Cruz and Rubio were practiced as always - perhaps overly so - using language from their stump speeches or in Cruz's case trying to reprise an attack on the moderators from an earlier debate. Failing to fully take command of the stage, the two provided an opening to others, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie jumped quickly tried to take it.
Bush went after Rubio for cutting and running on immigration reform when Republican Party sentiment shifted against a path to citizenship. Christie played the governor card, chastising both Cruz and Rubio as double-talking legislators who were unwilling to admit they changed their minds.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the other mainstream conservative fighting for establishment support, tried anew to set himself apart as a pragmatic and compassionate Republican. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky needled the others and tried to draw as much libertarian support as possible to give his candidacy a boost. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who once led the polls in Iowa, was barely a presence for much of the evening.
The competition between Cruz and Rubio played out throughout the debate. With Cruz seeking to consolidate religious conservatives, who have made up a majority of GOP caucus attendees in the past, Rubio took every opportunity to talk about his Christian faith.
Asked about a Time magazine cover from several years ago that described him as the potential savior of the Republican Party, Rubio responded by talking about Jesus Christ as the only savior he knows. His answer underscored the direct appeal to Christian conservatives he has made in his television advertising here in the past few weeks.
Though much was at stake, the debate lacked some of the expected fireworks. There were long stretches in which the candidates settled into predictable answers and safe comments. The candidates appeared to have come to the stage with strategies designed primarily not to make mistakes rather than to score points.
Thursday provided a preview of some of the battles that could unfold in the coming weeks. But with Trump absent from the stage, the event lacked the drama and finality that debates on the eve of critical caucuses and primaries have sometimes offered in the past. In that sense, the forum was artificial in framing the Republican race as it now stands.
The focus at Thursday's debate was on the seven candidates who shared the stage more than one who wasn't there. Between now and Monday, however, there will be a different, narrower, focus in Iowa, one in which Trump and Cruz will be the principal actors. All the others will be fighting for respectability and whatever marginal advantage they can squeeze out against their rivals.
The battle between Trump and Cruz for supremacy in Iowa will consume most of the attention over the final days of campaigning here. A loss for either, given what has happened over the past month, will be a setback no matter how the results are spun by their advisers.
Some of the other candidates will clear out of the state by the time voters assemble Monday evening to declare their preferences. A few candidates have skipped Iowa in past campaigns, but there has been nothing to compare to the 2016 contest, which amounts to two campaigns at once, with a handful of candidates focused here and many others on New Hampshire.
A Republican field that began with 17 candidates has suffered a handful of casualties even before the voting begins - candidates buried by Trump's presence and lacking the financial resources to continue to compete effectively. Among those still competing, the undercard debates have highlighted the cruel power of the polls to separate candidates into an upstairs-downstairs hierarchy.
For many of the candidates still campaigning, the end of the line is near. Iowa and New Hampshire will winnow the field significantly, if history is any guide (though history has been an unreliable guide for much of the past eight months). South Carolina and Nevada will narrow it more. By this time next month, the once-gigantic field could be reduced to three or four viable candidates.
In a matter of days, the voters of Iowa will begin to provide some clarity to the Republican race. The blizzard of polls that have provided fodder for months will pale in comparison with the power of the voters, however large or small the turnout in the caucuses Monday night. The past months have provided an orgy of speculation and ever-changing assessments of the state of the race. After Monday, there will be concrete results that will shape the strategies and the conversation.

BOULDER, Colo. --- For most of this year, Sen. Marco Rubio (Florida) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) have been in the background of the Republican presidential campaign. On Wednesday night, they broke out into the open, delivering strong and forceful performances in a raucous and rambling Republican debate marked by squabbling and sharp elbows.
Both Rubio and Cruz have won modest plaudits for their performances in the first two debates, but there was a demonstrable difference in what unfolded on the stage at the University of Colorado. They outshone Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the leaders in the polls, and Rubio overshadowed his onetime mentor, former Florida governor Jeb Bush.
Whether this was a unique moment for Rubio and Cruz or a foreshadowing of where the Republican nomination contest is heading is a matter of speculation, with the voters the ultimate arbiters starting early next year. But both candidates served notice Wednesday that they are ready for the next phase of a rapidly changing and increasingly fractious campaign.
Trump more than held his own, improving on his performance in the second debate, in which he faded during the final hour. He showed little of the frustration that has been on display lately on the campaign trail. Carson was typically low-key, a style that has benefited him during the campaign even as his ideas and background face increased scrutiny.
But in the end, the two first-term senators from two of the most-populous states in the country might have gained the most, in part because each is seen among many GOP strategists as poised to rise to greater prominence in the race.
In Republican circles, Rubio has been the focus of the most attention to date, despite relatively weak poll numbers and more potential than actual performance. He probably gained considerable credibility Wednesday night, particularly with fundraisers. Whether he can convert that into popular support remains the biggest question about his candidacy.
Rubio long has had the potential to become a crossover candidate, capable of corralling the support of mainstream conservatives and wealthy fundraisers, and able at the same time to tap into the frustrations of the GOP's tea party wing. That remains his strongest calling card, if he is able to build from here.
Cruz occupies a different space in the GOP race: the hard-line conservative who has worn as a badge of honor his battles with Republican leaders in Washington and regularly espousing his belief that what the party needs is a nominee who can genuinely articulate the conservative principles that much of the base embraces.
Rubio arrived knowing he would come under attack, and he was well prepped. His strongest moment occurred when he was asked about his absenteeism in the Senate and his obvious disdain for a body he joined less than five years ago.
Responding to a question about an editorial in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that was headlined, "Marco Rubio should resign, not rip us off," Rubio turned the issue back on the news organization by pointing to former Florida senator Bob Graham, then-senator John F. Kerry and then-senator Barack Obama, all of whom ran for president and missed scores of votes. Rubio said none of them drew the ire of the newspaper in the way he has.
"This is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement," he said.
Bush sought to piggyback on the question, claiming that Rubio was working "like a French work week" and that he owed his constituents much more. "You can campaign or just resign and let someone else take the job," Bush said.
Rubio took Bush's question and went on the offense, accusing his rival of trying to take him down to save his own campaign. "The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you," he said.
Cruz seized the stage a few minutes later with an attack on the CNBC moderators, claiming that the round of opening questions to Trump, Carson, Kasich, Rubio and Bush were biased and had nothing to do with the country's problems.
"The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media," Cruz said. "This is not a cage match."
Cruz also drew a contrast with the recent Democratic debate, saying those candidates had drawn only fawning questions. "Nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary," he said.
Attacks on the media have been a staple of past Republican debates, and Cruz's sharp words drew huge applause from the audience inside the Coors Events Center and stirred strong positive reaction on social media and, no doubt, among the disgruntled conservatives whom he has courted almost from the moment he arrived in the Senate a few years ago.
The debate sprawled over economic and other topics, and other candidates had times when they sought to take the spotlight. Most of the candidates played to type Wednesday night. All could point to moments when they made their points effectively.
Bush stressed his record in Florida and said he would shake up Washington but do it in a way that brought people together. But he got the worst end of the exchange with Rubio, no doubt to his detriment.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich opened with a screed against Trump and Carson as unqualified to serve as president, and he said it was time to end the "fantasy" of what they were saying and look to people with records of accomplishment.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee continued their debate about the future of Social Security.
Sen. Rand Paul (Kentucky) railed against the new budget deal brokered by outgoing House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and the White House and pledged to filibuster it.
Carly Fiorina, who used two previous debate performances to raise her profile and, temporarily, her poll numbers, defended her tenure as chief executive at Hewlett-Packard and said she would be as tough on Hillary Rodham Clinton as any other potential GOP nominee.
Wednesday's debate was at times unmanageable. Candidates showed only minimal respect for the rules, and the moderators provoked the anger of the candidates. Candidates spoke over one another repeatedly, especially in the early stages.
The third debate of the pre-primary season came at a time when two of the outsiders in the crowded field continued to dominate the Republican race. But it also came at a time of volatility and greater uncertainty than a month ago, as some national and state polls began to shift away from Trump and toward Carson.
With fewer than 100 days before the voting begins in Iowa in early February, the GOP contest has moved into a more intensive phase. For a number of the candidates lagging in the polls or performing below expectations, the sense of urgency was apparent on the stage Wednesday night in Boulder.
The Republican race has defied almost everyone's expectations this year, and there is no consensus among veteran Republican strategists about what the future holds. Wednesday's debate might have offered a preview of what's to come.

Tolle Nachrichten aus Südtunesien: Die bewässerte Oasenfläche hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten stark ausgedehnt. In der Mai-Ausgabe 2017 des Journal of African Earth Sciences erscheint hierzu der folgende Artikel eines Teams um Emilio Rodríguez-Caballero:
Irrigated land expansion since 1985 in Southern Tunisia
The causes of agricultural land expansion and its impacts on dryland ecosystems such as the oasis regions of Southern Tunisia, are fundamental problems challenging the sustainability of irrigated agriculture on water limited ecosystems. Consequently, a thorough understanding of this phenomenon is necessary to avoid future problems. With the objective of identifying irrigated land expansion dynamics and the primary drivers, two representative oasis regions in Southern Tunisia, Mareth and Fatnassa, were selected. Changes in irrigated lands in both regions between 1985 and 2011 were analyzed, and the land uses from which expansion occurred were identified using Landsat images from different years (1985, 1996 and 2011). The results indicate that the surface occupied by irrigation agriculture has doubled in Mareth, while in Fatnassa, it has increased fourfold. During that period, there was a simultaneous increase in total population, as consequence of human migration that came along with an increase in income. Thus, we could identify human migration and economic development as potential drivers of irrigated agriculture expansion, though further research is warranted to ascertain a quantification that would assist in obtaining the sustainability of these regions.
—————-
Im Juni 2016 erschien im IPCC-nahen Fachblatt Nature Climate Change ein kurioser Artikel von Jong-yeon Park, Jürgen Bader und Daniela Matei vom Hamburger Max Planck Institute für Meteorologie zur Niederschlagsentwicklung in der Sahelzone. Zunächst wird behauptet, die Sahel-Dürren der 1960er und 70er Jahre wären eine Folge der Klimaerwärmung, dann wird eingeräumt, dass es in den letzten Jahrzehnten dort wieder mehr geregnet hat – und das obwohl die Klimaerwärmung doch weiter fortschritt. Die Hamburger zeigen sich kreativ und zaubern einen weiteren Hasen aus dem Zylinder: “Schuld” an dem vermehrten Sahel-Regen hat wiederum der Mensch, nämlich durch die anthropogene Erwärmung des Mittelmeeres. Anstatt die natürliche Variabilität und Ozeanzyklik als wichtigen Steuerungsfaktor anzuerkennen, begeben sich die alarmhungrigen Forscher auf seltsame Interpretationswege. Abschließend wagen Park und Kollegen sogar eine Prognose: Es könnte in Zukunft sogar noch mehr im Sahel regnen, verursacht durch den ungezügelten Treibhausgas-Ausstoß der Menschen. Schmunzeln erlaubt. Hier der Abstract:
Anthropogenic Mediterranean warming essential driver for present and future Sahel rainfall
The long-lasting Sahel drought in the 1970s and 1980s caused enormous human and socio-economic losses1, driving extensive research on its causes2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Although changes in global and regional sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are thought to be dominant drivers of the severe Sahel drying trend9, 10, 11, 12, the mechanisms for the recent recovery trend are not fully clear yet, but are often assumed to be akin to the previous SST–Sahel drought linkage13, 14, 15. Here we show, by analysing observational and multi-model data and conducting SST-sensitivity experiments with two state-of-the-art atmospheric models, that the SST key area causing the recent Sahel rainfall recovery is the Mediterranean Sea. Anthropogenic warming of this region has driven the shift from the tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans, which historically were the main driver of Sahel drought. The wetting impact of Mediterranean Sea warming can become more dominant in a future warming climate and is key to understanding the uncertainty in future Sahel rainfall projections.
Drei Monate später zeigten Catherine Pomposi und drei weitere New Yorker Kollegen in den Geophysical Research Letters die wahren Zusammenhänge auf. Sie machten pazifische Ozeanyzklen als wichtigen Steuerungsfaktor des Sahelregens aus:
Understanding Pacific Ocean influence on interannual precipitation variability in the Sahel
Moisture budget decomposition is performed for the Sahel (10°–20°N and 20°W–40°E) in order to understand the processes that govern regional hydroclimate variability on interannual time scales and frame them in the context of their primary ocean driver. Results show that warm conditions in the Eastern Tropical Pacific remotely force anomalously dry conditions primarily through affecting the low-troposphere mass divergence field. This behavior is related to increased subsidence over the tropical Atlantic and into the Sahel and an anomalous westward flow of moisture from the continent, both resulting in a coherent drying pattern. Understanding the physical processes relating remote sea surface temperature anomalies to atmospheric circulation changes and the resulting complex local convergence patterns is important for advancing seasonal prediction of precipitation over West Africa.
Das Hamburger Max-Planck-Institut hat in den vergangenen Jahren wichtige neue Erkenntnisse zu Aerosolen und anderen Themen beigesteuert. Die Sahel-Arbeit gehört leider nicht zu den besten Arbeiten, genausowenig wie die MPI-Studien zum arktische Meereis.

THEATER REVIEW
Immigrant Led Astray in His New Home‘Probation,’ by Yoshvani Medina, in Spanish
By ANDY WEBSTER
Published: July 24, 2012
The playwright and director Yoshvani Medina was born in Cuba, and judging from “Probation,” his engaging work presented by Repertorio Español at the Gramercy Arts Theater, he is consumed with ambivalence about that country. Throughout the play, essentially a dialectic between pro-Cuban and pro-American sentiments, Mr. Medina resists taking sides, wisely preferring to explore gray areas in each perspective.
A prologue presents an unspecified but recent military skirmish in Cuba: A dying Fredo (Sandor Juan) extracts a promise from Pancho (Alfonso Rey) that he will take care of Fredo’s son, Freddy. A year later Pancho is in Miami, and Freddy (also Mr. Juan) and his pregnant wife, Yenny (Hannia Guillén), arrive to start a new life. Pancho sets up Freddy at a shady clinic engaged in Medicaid fraud; the wry, skeptical Yenny seeks employment as a standup comic.
Freddy knows Pancho’s offer is suspect, but the money proves too tempting, and before long he has a house, two cars and the feds on his trail. When the authorities close in, he eyes a return to Cuba, but Pancho, the godfather to his son, tries to dissuade him. (“In Cuba, people have nothing,” he says. “Everything belongs to the government,” which prompts Freddy to retort, “And everything here belongs to the banks.”) Yenny, now a journalist and blogger, has ideas of her own.
The production is in Spanish, which a new, unobtrusive captioning system translates, leaving non-Spanish speakers to savor Mr. Medina’s assured direction and the appealing cast. (Jorge Noa and Pedro Balmaseda’s stark, malleable set keeps the focus squarely on the actors.)
Freddy, who is earnest but seducible, is eclipsed by the cynical Pancho, whose gruff observations can be hilarious, though their more heated exchanges verge on the didactic. Ms. Guillén’s character offers vital leavening, with monologues about sex and the lessons she’s learned in America; her blog is called I Live in Miami (and I Know Its Entrails). Unseen is Freddy and Yenny’s baby, Fred, part of a future generation fated to inherit the impasse between countries so close and yet so very far apart.
“Probation” continues through Sept. 27 at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan; (212) 225-9999, repertorio.org/probation.

Lenten Anger About Anger
February 27, 2018 / Larry	/ 6 Comments
Anger is a tornado in the human soul.
Roiling within us, like warm moist air, are memories of past mistakes and a host of personal beliefs and biases. On the outside, from the imagined thoughts or real injuries from another person or situation, flows the cool, dry air. Over years, or in a splintered second, the dry wind swirls with that inner moist air and . . .
Anger!
Police and civil rights activists clash, fire hoses spraying, dogs lunging at the end of leashes.
The national guard, all young, grasping weapons, form lines on a college campus. They face the rebellious students, all young, their clenched fists raised in the air. A storm of bullets is released.
21st century Nazis march, in polo shirts and jeans. Some have, not long before, serviced someone’s car or managed a portfolio. But how skewed their hateful views are about our nation’s past and today’s diverse culture. They clash with others that also earn a paycheck and yet possess a different, more complex version of history and society. They are last year’s Charlottesville and this year’s looming headline.
+ + +
Anger!
John 2:14 – In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.
2:15 Wielding a Glock 22, he drove all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
2:16 He told those who were selling the doves, “Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace!”
Jesus, bearing the burden of the world, steeped in God’s compassion and concerns, sees and feels and acts out against those who desecrate the temple. How could Jesus not turn the tables over? How could Jesus, with his intense gaze and calloused hands, not charge into the holy mess of money changers? Had religion become buying and selling, a descent into financial and spiritual debt over the price of a man-made heaven?
We rarely experience a Jesus with emotions in the Gospels. His enraged words and actions against the money-changers was not Jesus the storyteller or the one supporting grieving parents and isolated lepers. And yet how could he not be angry?
+ + +
Anger is our friend. It is our worst enemy.
I am angry about another school massacre. But not as angry as I once was. Don’t MSNBC and Fox News agree: first we’re stunned, mumble thoughts and prayer, maybe cast some blame, declare why we will/won’t change, and then reset for the next time an AR-15 spews bullets at flesh?
I am angry with suggestions about turning schools into armed camps. Guards with guns! Really? Skilled teachers—the good guys—with pistols to shoot the bad guys! Really? And then the President, parroting the NRA, said, “We have to harden our schools, not soften them . . .” Why not attack-trained German shepherds roaming the hallways and concertina wire on the perimeter? Those short-term solutions will only lead to more deaths and more grief. (I sometimes say I could be wrong. I am not wrong about the death and grief based on the NRA’s solutions.)
I am angry about another school massacre because I’m male. Why are the shooters always male?
I am angry because every time we talk about guns, suicide is rarely mentioned. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, “Every day in America, 93 people die from gun violence. Fifty-eight of those deaths, or nearly two-thirds, are suicides with guns.” If we truly addressed all the issues twisting around guns, would we have fewer suicides? I believe so.
I am angry, in this Lent of 2018, about guns because I’m of a generation forever tainted by bullets. When I was eleven, President Kennedy was shot. The assassin ordered his gun by mail-order. How much have we done to have well-regulated gun sales since 1963? Since Columbine? Since Sandy Hook? How can a country bear so many murderous arms and expect anything other than violence? Why does the bloodiest interpretation of the Second Amendment trump a child’s or President’s life?
Actor Daniel Day-Lewis in “The Last of the Mohicans.”
I am angry because of the arms we wanted the “right to bear” when the Constitution was written:
A musket. (In 60 seconds, 3-4 inaccurate shots could be loaded and fired.)
A long rifle. (Literally long and takes longer to load, but more accurate.)
A pistol. (Nearly useless, so keep your knife nearby.)
That’s it. (Well, back in George Washington’s day, a cannon was used . . . but gun advocates usually don’t suggest a howitzer for home protection.)
Today’s weaponry? Machine guns and sniper rifles, pistols and revolvers, bazookas (for military buffs) and derringers (fits in a purse), shotguns (Dad gave me a hand-me-down .410) and blunderbusses (for gun collectors). There are a thousand weapons of mass destruction at your trigger-happy fingertips. Where are the money changers these days? Online! At your gun show! At your Bass Pro Shop. Get your home protection gear here! Depending on your zip code, a carry permit costs a few bucks and is easy enough to acquire. Teachers and preachers, just pack heat to protect the classroom or sanctuary. No worries, the teacher has a loaded Glock? They’ll know we are Christians by our concealed handguns?
In the depths of my soul, it’s not guns that stir my anger. Not really.
I am angry about anger.
We have so little humble, righteous anger anymore. Jesus is at the temple, offended by those turning faith into a revenue stream. He overturns tables, snaps a whip, bellows about serving God and not money. How quaint. So . . . first century.
No, the anger in this season of Lent I worry about, that spoils and soils my sense of hope, is that everyone seems so angry all the time. It is always tornado season. We attack with words. We attack with guns. We attack.
Right now, another troubled person is concocting a plan that includes an AR-15 and a shitload of bullets. For real or imagined reasons, he’s angry at the girlfriend that jilted him. Angry at the teacher that gave him the grade he actually earned. Angry at someone that belittled him. Angry at the cop who pulled him over for speeding. Angry, and he has no one to talk to.
He’s crazy! Right? Isn’t that a swell excuse? You’d almost think it made sense of the senseless. Indeed, some are mentally ill. Let’s care for them, and care enough to make sure they can’t bear arms. And yet what about all the others that can so easily become isolated, fractured, afraid, and . . . angry?
I’d be less angry if the NRA stuck to gun safety issues. When they call for “hardened schools,” our collective hearts will become harder and the tornadoes will keep spinning.
I’d be less angry if the President learned from the Ash Wednesday survivors of a Florida school pockmarked with high velocity rounds of ammunition. Those teens know more about killing fields than 99% of card-carrying NRA members. Whenever the President stiffly reads a teleprompter about people getting along, and then tweets more insults, another tornado is unleashed.
In this season of Lenten reflection, where I am ash, and I have come from dirt and will return to dirt, my righteous anger seems meaningless.
The unholy tornadoes of anger rage on, fed by dry hatred and moist fear.
O Holy One, give me words for a loving, righteous anger that might bind some wounds.
Please . . .

Larry, your ache enables me to wake a little, to stir from blinded slumber on the other side of the pond. I realise how (forgive me) used I am to American school shootings. Why doesn’t it shock me more – ?! I realised today that I have lost hope of change in your gun laws that as a brit I fail to understand. May the Holy One indeed give you and many words for a loving, righteous anger that might bind some wounds. Thank you for gift and heart to write so powerfully.

Thanks for your comments, Marc.
I haven’t completely lost hope, but I’m more pessimistic than I’d like to be.
I recently listened to a National Public Radio interview where one of the speakers pointed out the obvious difference between how the United States approaches any form of “gun control” vs. the rest of the world. It’s the U.S. Constitution’s 2nd Amendment. The “right” to guns is protected. As obvious as that is, it is also telling. Any discussion about guns, as with “free speech” and “freedom of religion” is also a conversation about the highest laws of the land. Can the amendments be interpreted and re-interpreted? Yes. Can there be additional amendments? Sure. But any “new” way of looking at a constitutional right or any significant change is a HUGE undertaking.

As I read it He drove the animals out of the Temple. Animals not raised by nomads and sacrificed through love and grief but merely as a part of a commercial transaction. Yes. anger because the Holy was the victim of piety…..think of basketball courts to attract young males so that we can seduce them after a hot game into spirituality. I suspect the Temple authorities meant well. In the same way that water wells 12000 miles away are a good thing but the trash in our cities . crazed, addicted, do not sell . you avethe right of it. Righteous indignation I think it was Bonhoeffer that said “It is a strange religion that offers as its greatest blessing participation in a crucifixion” Bless you for yet another great meditation.

February 20, 2018
A new study published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine implies that older men could lower their risk of death by involving themselves in any level of physical activity, including light intensity exercise, for a few minutes.

According to researchers, low intensity exercises are better suited to older men. The current exercise guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activities in sessions lasting 10 or more minutes. However, it may be difficult for older adults to achieve such a pattern.
To discover whether other patterns of physical activity might be associated with a lower death risk, scientists assessed the data obtained from the British Regional Heart Study, which involved 7735 participants from 24 British towns, whose age ranged between 40 and 59 years when the study was carried out during 1978–1980.
In 2010–2012, the 3137 survivors were invited for a medical check-up, which included a physical examination and a questionnaire concerning their sleeping patterns, lifestyle, and their previous experience of heart disease, if any.
They were also instructed to wear an accelerometer – a device used to continuously track the volume and intensity of physical activity – during waking hours for 7 days. Their health conditions were then tracked until their death or June 2016, whichever came sooner.
In total, about 50% (1566) of the men agreed to wear the device; however, after excluding the participants with pre-existing heart disease and those who hadn’t worn their accelerometer enough during the 7 days, the final analysis centered on 1181 men, whose average age was 78. During the study period of about 5 years, 194 of the men died.
The study findings showed that total volume of physical activity, starting from light intensity exercises up, was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause.
Furthermore, participants who participated in an additional 30 minutes a day of low intensity physical activities had a reduced risk of death by 17%. This association persisted even after considering the potentially influential lifestyle factors, like sedentary time.
Though the equivalent reduction in the death risk was around 33% for every additional 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity a day, the advantages of light intensity activity were sufficient to prove that this too might prolong life.
Sporadic bouts of activity were linked with a 41% lower risk of death and bouts lasting 10 or more minutes were linked to a 42% lowered risk. Sporadic bouts seemed easier to attain as 66% of the men achieved their weekly total of moderate to vigorous physical activity in this way; however, only 16% achieved their weekly total in bouts of 10 or more minutes.
In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that cutting down the sitting time was linked to a lower risk of death.
The results suggest that all activities, however modest, are beneficial. The finding that [low intensity physical activity] is associated with lower risk of mortality is especially important among older men, as most of their daily physical activity is of light intensity. Furthermore, the pattern of accumulation of physical activity did not appear to alter the associations with mortality, suggesting that it would be beneficial to encourage older men to be active irrespective of bouts.”
Dr Barbara Jefferis, University College London
Since the current research work is an observational study, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And those who wore the accelerometer tended to be younger and possessed healthier lifestyles than those who didn’t. Therefore, this might account for distorted results. Moreover, the results were unclear on whether it would be equally applicable to younger age groups or older women.

NumbersUSA - Judge rules in favor of companies who replace American workers
Roy Beck - founder
This Issue: H-1B ruling proves that existing law allows employers to replace American workers
Fri, Oct 14th
A federal judge in Orlando, Fla. ruled yesterday that the Walt Disney Company did not violate the law when it laid off roughly 250 high-tech American workers in 2014 and forced them to train their H-1B, foreign-worker replacements as a condition of their severance.
The plaintiffs, two of the laid off Disney workers, claimed that Disney and the two companies they outsourced the jobs to, Cognizant Technology Solutions and HCL America, had conspired to violate visa laws.
Federal Judge Gregory A. Presnell's ruling wasn't too surprising given the fact that existing federal law allows employers to do exactly what Disney did. But Disney's response to the ruling was a bit more appalling given the national fallout since news of the layoffs went public. According to the New York Times:
A spokeswoman for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Jacquee Wahler, said, "As we have said all along, this lawsuit was completely baseless, and we are gratified by the decision."
In other words, Disney is pleased that federal law allows American companies to replace American workers with cheaper, more compliant foreign workers.
Under existing H-1B rules, it's easy for companies like Disney to replace existing American workers with foreign workers. The law allows companies to replace their workers as long as
they pay H-1B workers more than $60,000 a year, show that the worker has an advanced degree, and wait at least 90 days between the time the H-1B petition was filed and the replacement date of the American worker.
The waiting period is rarely an issue because the wait time from when an employer files a petition for an H-1B worker and when they receive an affirmative answer is usually more than 90 days. And according to Salary.com, an entry level software engineer in Orlando makes a little more than $61,000 per year, so the wage requirement isn't an issue for most employers either. In reality, the American workers doing the same job are likely making at least 50% more than that, so employers are still saving thousands of dollars by hiring cheaper H-1B workers to replace them.
The H-1B program is one of the most explicit examples of federal immigration policy working against the interests of American workers and the nation as a whole. And yet, Congress has done nothing to address it. In fact, there are more elected officials calling for increases in the H-1B program and an even further loosening of the rules than those who are calling for meaningful reforms that would prioritize American workers.
Supporters of the H-1B program argue that there is a shortage of American workers to fill these jobs and there are adequate protections in place to protect them. But yesterday's ruling undermines that argument. Clearly, the law, as written, allows companies to legally displace American workers, and the Disney example shows that there is no worker shortage.
In these remaining weeks before the general election, we urge you to hold your Members of Congress accountable on this issue and ask what they'll do to put an end to the abuses within the H-1B program.

Federal Judge Strikes Down ICE Immigration Detainers in Six States
Wed, Oct 12th
A federal judge in the Northern District of Illinois voided thousands of ICE detainers requesting that deportable aliens and others be held in custody for 48 hours after their normal release to accommodate Agent pickup. The ruling increases the likelihood that aliens in at least six states will be released to the streets and disappear before they can be captured and placed in federal detention facilities.
DHS Documents Reveal How Mexico is Helping Haitians Reach the U.S. Illegally
Tue, Oct 11th
According to internal Homeland Security documents obtained by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), Mexico has been granting Haitians 20-day transit documents in order to reach the U.S. border. This policy and lax immigration enforcement in the U.S. has led to a 1,800% increase in Haitians illegally crossing the border in 2016.

10 Automakers Equipped most of their 2018 Vehicles with Automatic Emergency Braking
10 Automakers Equipped most of their 2018 Vehicles with Automatic Emergency Braking
Link
Washington, DC - - (March 13, 2019) - - Today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published the following information:
Ten automakers report equipping more than half of the vehicles they produced between September 1, 2017, and August 31, 2018, with automatic emergency braking (AEB), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) announced today. This is the second update of manufacturer progress toward equipping every new passenger vehicle with the crash avoidance technology by September 1, 2022.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Earlier today, I spoke with Prime Minister Ardern of New Zealand to express the sorrow of our entire nation following the monstrous terror attacks at two mosques. These sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing. You’ve all been seeing what went on. It’s a horrible, horrible thing. I told the Prime Minister that the United States is with them all the way, a hundred percent. Whatever they need, we will be there. New Zealand has been a great friend and partner for many years. Our relationship has never been better. And what they’re going through is absolutely terrible.
So our hearts are with them, and whatever we can do.
We’re grateful to be joined today by the Vice President — thank you very much, Mike, for being here — members of my Cabinet, devoted public servants, and Angel parents — very important people to me and to a lot of other people. I want to thank you all for being here. Thank you so much for being here, and we appreciate it. Thank you. You’ve gone through a lot. As we take action to restore our national sovereignty and defend this nation from criminal cartels, human traffickers, and drug smugglers. Crime of all kinds coming through our southern border and other places. But this is the place. This is the place. We have the biggest problem by far.
And I... read more

Briefing With Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams
Briefing With Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams
Link
Washington, DC - - (March 15, 2019) - - Today, the U.S. Department of State published the following Special Briefing (in the Press Briefing Room) with Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams:
MR PALLADINO: Welcome back. It’s Friday and we have with us Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams. Thank you for joining us again. Please.
MR ABRAMS: You’re very welcome. I’m going to start taking attendance and see how much interest there is here. (Laughter.)
A few things to start with. The diplomatic staff from Embassy Caracas arrived at Dulles Airport just after 11 o’clock last night, and they will be meeting the Secretary at 2:30 this afternoon. They will in essence continue their mission from other locations – from the State Department for the most part – to try to support the Venezuelan people as they struggle to return Venezuela to democracy.
Just a – on consular services, I think we’ve said this before, but some time ago – actually a month ago – we said that non-immigrant visas would be handled in Bogota; immigrant – excuse me, immigrant visas would be handled in Bogota for Venezuelans; non-immigrant visas can be applied for wherever the individual is, at any embassy or consulate around the world.

All to regret nuclear deal failure: Iranian President tells visiting French FM

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says everyone will regret the possible collapse of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries in 2015 as the US continues its efforts to sabotage the deal and issues threats to pull out of it.
In a meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Tehran on Monday, the Iranian president added that it is imperative to save the nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in order to improve regional security, stability and cooperation.
"Of course, we will be ready for any conditions, which would not be favorable to us," the Iranian president added.
Iran and the P5+1 countries - namely the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China plus Germany - finalized the nuclear accord in July 2015 and started implementing it in January 2016.
Under the deal, Iran undertook to apply certain limits to its nuclear program in exchange for the termination of all nuclear-related sanctions against Tehran.
"The survival of the JCPOA will prove to the world that negotiations and diplomacy are the best options to solve problems," President Rouhani said.
He; however, warned that any collapse of the nuclear deal would mean that political negotiations are a waste of time.
The Iranian president urged all the signatories to the JCPOA to remain committed to their obligations under the deal, saying, "Iran will never be the first party to violate the JCPOA and regards this deal as effective in increasing regional and international trust, peace, cooperation and stability."
US President Donald Trump on January 12 reluctantly agreed to waive sanctions against Iran that were lifted as part of the landmark deal, but said it would be the last time he issued such a waiver unless conditions were met.
Trump said he wanted Congress and America's European allies to use the 120-day period before sanctions relief once again comes up for renewal to agree to tougher measures and new conditions; otherwise Washington would pull out of the deal.
In a telephone conversation with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, President Rouhani hailed France's stance on the multilateral deal.
"Tehran will remain committed to its undertakings as long as the opposite sides implement the JCPOA," he said.
In a meeting with the French foreign minister in Tehran earlier on Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Europe must pressure the United States to fulfill its obligations under the JCPOA.
"Europe must put the US under pressure to implement its commitments and not allow the US to make illogical and unlawful demands despite its lack of commitment and violations [of its commitments]," Zarif said.
France keen to save JCPOA: Le Drian
The French foreign minister, for his part, said Paris was keen to save and implement the nuclear deal.
Reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have proved that Iran has fully complied with the JCPOA, he said, adding that France would make its utmost efforts to save the accord.
Europe regards the nuclear agreement as a fundamental document for improving regional development and stability, Le Drian noted.
He emphasized that Iran and France could have positive cooperation on ways to improve regional stability and security, prevent humanitarian catastrophe in regional countries, and settle the ongoing crises in the region.
The French foreign minister visited Iran on Monday on a delicate mission to reaffirm Europe's support for the nuclear agreement. He held talks with senior Iranian officials including Secretary of Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani and Foreign Minister Zarif.
After a day of tough talks, Le Drian said France would continue discussions with Iran, stressing the importance of finding a way to restore stability to the region.

Animal Friends react to the case of sick cows being slaughtered in Poland
- All farm animals are born and live in disease-ridden conditions, whilst the slaughter of downer cows is routine
Animal Friends Croatia pointed out the absurdity of reporting on the case of diseased cows from Polish slaughterhouses, whereby consumers are being reassured that the disease-ridden meat has not ended up in Croatia, that people do not have to worry and can continue eating meat available on our market carelessly, because it is "safe" and "health approved". At the same time, media outlets warn that the photos and the footage of sick cows that workers drag around the slaughterhouse are "disturbing" and that consumers are viewing them "at their own liability". How is it possible for human beings to look at the suffering of animals only from the perspective of benefitting off their dead flesh for human needs? Isn't that most "disturbing" and ethically defeating to the human race and isn't it precisely what we should, both as individuals and as a species, bear the greatest responsibility for?
Luka Oman, Animal Friends president, warns us: "Currently, farms worldwide annually raise and then kill more than 60 billion animals in slaughterhouses. It is impossible to ensure the health of such an enormous number of animals. They survive horrific conditions of intensive farming until the time of slaughter only because of the mass use of antibiotics in the industrial production. The industry only cares about the profit, soeverything will be done to maximize the use of animals and to bring them to the slaughterhouse alive at any cost, because that is the only way they will beuseful. Does anyone really think that sick animals are a rarity in the industry and that such animals do not end up in slaughterhouses? Any farmed meat, and all of it is farmed, is sick."
"What is also sick is human indifference to the suffering that all farmed animals endure", Oman points out, inviting us to ask ourselves why it is normal for us to separate calves from their mothers to drink their milk, and to draw as much as up to 50l of milk daily from those mothers; why it is normal that cows do not graze grass, but rather eat fish and other animals and, at best, grains and soybeans; why it does not disturb us that they usually see the light of day only when leaving for the slaughterhouse, overcrowded in transportation trucks.
He adds that it is devastating that most people fall under the influence of the system which treats living beings as walking steaks and presents something like that as normal and healthy. What is concerning in the case from Poland is human apathy to the suffering and pain of living beings, as well as to the injustice happening daily to those with whom we need to share this planet, rather than turning them into biological machines, which is what we are doing.
The video footage shows a living being who feels pain just as we do. This living being is dragged away to slaughter, even though they haven't done anything wrong and their meat is not a necessity. Animal Friends say that if scenes from Poland showed dogs instead of cows, perhaps we would start also worrying about the animals, not just their meat. That is exactly why they are reminding us that, nothing healthy and humane can come out of this unnatural human attitude towards animals. They wonder whether consumers are really new to seeing the collapsed sick cows, which is a common occurrence in the milk and meat industry, or to claim they don't know what the suffering-filled concentration camps called farms, the transportation trucks and slaughterhouses look like. It's really just a collective self-denial that meat not filled with disease even exists.
Animal Friends invite everyone to watch the short film "Croatia's Invisible Animals", "Earthlings" and others on Animal Friends' YouTube channel, which show routine treatment of animals on meat, milk and egg production farms. They are also inviting us to ask ourselves why birds lay eggs, why mammals produce milk and in which kind of sick ways do we exploit the biological processes of other animals' mothers, when we also have mothers of our own.
They are telling us to take another look at the footage from Poland and pay attention to the living being, not the meat. While investigating the case in Poland, we should start with ourselves and our eating habits, which are the cause of all sickness that farmed animals experience and which returns to us like a boomerang.

Cabinet approves Heathrow expansion
Controversial plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport have been approved by ministers.
The government's economic sub-committee, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May, backed the plans which were then approved by her full cabinet.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was a "historic moment".
Announcing £2.6bn in compensation for residents and noise abatement measures he said it would only proceed if air quality obligations were met.

In a flash order transaction, buy or sell orders are shown to a collection of high-frequency traders for just 30 milliseconds before they are routed to everyone else.

The people who want to be recognized as the greatest traders are probably not the greatest traders. Egos get in the way of the process. In my opinion, you never want to be the largest player in the pit.

One common adage...that is completely wrongheaded is: You can't go broke taking profits. That's precisely how many traders do go broke. While amateurs go broke by taking large losses, professionals go broke by taking small profits.

I use non-fiction work written by Whites in my research. It's indispensable. That wasn't the problem. I said that "The Wire" was a clichÃ©! It's like my writing a series about Jewish life and casting all of the characters as inside traders.

Breaking Down Santa Monica’s Budget

The City Seal at Santa Monica City Hall
People living in Santa Monica enjoy quite a lot of amenities for a city its size. Santa Monica, home to about 90,000 people, has its own police force and fire department.
Within its eight square miles, Santa Monica has five libraries, 26 parks (including a skate park and a public beach house), an urban runoff treatment plant, a vast network of nonprofits that serves some of the city’s most vulnerable people, and some of the best public schools in the county.
The City also operates its own bus system, water treatment plant, and TV station.
In order to keep its facilities in high working order and to deliver an optimum level of services, the City of Santa Monica employees more than 1,700 people in about 600 different position.
To pay for it all, the City also spends more than a half-billion dollars each year.

In May 2013, the City Council approved Santa Monica’s two-year budget, allocating $526 million for expenses for this financial year, which runs from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. At its May meeting, the Council also approved $529.4 million in expenses for the next financial year, which runs from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015.
The City provides a helpful user guide for understanding the budget process, but we thought we’d provide you with a brief rundown of the major points about the City Budget.
This slide from the City shows the breakdown of revenue sources for the General Fund.
The lion’s share (59 percent, or $311.9 million, in 2013-2014) of the City’s expenses are paid from the General Fund, which comes from an array of taxes, fees for business licenses and permits, and charges for services.
In the City’s 2013-2014 budget, local taxes accounted for $206.8 million in General Fund revenue.
The City levies a 14 percent “bed tax” (Transient Occupancy Tax, or TOT) on hotels, which generates more than $40 million a year for Santa Monica.
Unlike property taxes and sales tax, which together generate about $90 million a year for the City’s General Fund, 100 percent of TOT revenue goes directly to the City.
City Hall also collects permit and business license fees along with fines, like those you pay for parking. They account for about 10 percent of the City’s revenue.
The General Fund pays for personnel costs, work supplies, capital improvement projects – like Tongva Park and the future Colorado Esplanade – and to subsidize other funds like the Cemetery and the Pier funds, which don’t always generate enough revenue to sustain their own operations.
About 72 percent of General Fund goes to personnel costs, which include wages, health care, workers’ compensation costs, and pension contributions, for the City’s 1,700 employees, including police, firefighters, maintenance workers, City planners, and administrative staff.
As with a household budget, keeping Santa Monica’s finances in the black is a question of balancing income with expenses.
One of the major issues currently facing the City is how to keep personnel costs down.
“The rising cost of healthcare, and the need to supplement CalPERS [California Public Employee Retirement System] pension portfolios with higher contributions, drive our total compensation cost growth rate to a level that is approximately double our revenue growth rate,” according to the City’s budget overview.
There is little that cities can do to control the financial pressure exerted on them by CalPERS, however. In an interview with The Lookout, City Manager Rod Gould described CalPERS as the “Hotel California” of pension funds because, “you can never leave.”
To help mitigate costs, the City has negotiated with the local public employee unions to raise the amount that individual employees contribute to their own pensions.
In 2012, the City took a major hit when the California legislature passed a law shutting down about 400 redevelopment agencies (RDAs) throughout the state. RDAs had allowed cities to create additional revenue streams from property taxes dedicated to infrastructure improvements.
In Santa Monica, the City had been able to set aside about $15 million a year from RDA money to help finance affordable housing construction.
The City is currently considering new ways to make up the gap, including a possible ballot measure that would increase the City’s property transfer tax. Otherwise, the City could be faced with some very hard choices.
“Without a successful ballot measure, affordable housing for seniors, working families, persons with disabilities, and new lower-income residents might have to be subsidized out of general funds in the City budget,” said Councilmember Kevin McKeown.
“When I asked the City Manager how big a blow that would be, he told me it would be the equivalent of the entire budget for all our libraries,” he said.
Other City services are operated more like private businesses. These “enterprise funds,” which account for about 39 percent of

the City budget, make up operating costs through fees and rates charged to users.
One of the most visible examples is Santa Monica’s Big Blue Bus, which has an operating budget separate from the City’s General Fund.
While the City Council will sometimes allocate General Fund money to help pay for some of the Big Blue Bus’ expenses, the organization mostly pays for its own operations.
Trash and recycling collection is another example of a service that is paid for through an “enterprise fund.”
All of the City’s budgets going back to 1999, are available on the City’s website.

High School Assignment: Students Decide Who Lives, Dies Under Limited Healthcare

School assignment places kids as heads of death panels

Oct. 11, 2013
A high school assignment asking students to choose life or death for terminally-ill patients in a real-world limited healthcare scenario has sparked outrage.
Click to enlarge / via ChampionNews.net
Freshmen and sophomore students taking a social science class at the St. Joseph-Ogden High School in St. Joseph, Illinois, were provided a list of 10 fictional persons and asked to choose six people who they felt deserved to live. The other 4 would die.
“The following ten people have a problem,” the lesson begins. “They are all in desperate need of Kidney Dialysis (the process that removes wastes from the bloodstream). Unless they receive this procedure, they will die. The local hospital has enough machines to support only six people. That means four people are not going to live.”
The assignment asked students whether a housewife, doctor, lawyer, disabled person, cop, teacher, minister (Lutheran), college student, ex-convict or a prostitute ultimately deserved to meet their demise.
It listed the ten fictional terminal patients’ races, genders and ages, and asked pupils to score them each with numerical values from 1 to 10, 1 being the person they would most like to survive.
The macabre nature of the assignment of course echoes what many believe Obamacare will inevitably lead to, death panels which would have to be implemented in order to keep healthcare premiums low.
Champion News writer Lennie Jarratt contacted the school and was told the lesson was not at all about conditioning children to be indifferent to death panels, but was instead to teach students about “social bias.”
“The teacher’s goal is to educate students on the fact that these social value biases exist, and that hopefully students will see things from a different perspective after the activity is completed,” St. Joseph-Ogden High School principal Brian Brooks told Jarratt.
Fox News radio host Todd Starnes says that explanation doesn’t hold water.
“No matter what how the school tries to explain it, a group of young kids was deciding who got to live and who got a death sentence,” Starnes wrote.
“St. Joseph-Ogden High School’s social studies class sounds more like a recruitment center for the Department of Health and Human Services.”

The World Survey on the role of women in development 2014: Gender equality and sustainable development
Authors/editor(s): UN Women
The World Survey on the Role of Women in Development is a UN Secretary-General report mandated by the Second Committee of the General Assembly and comes out every five years. The 2014 report focuses on gender equality and sustainable development, with chapters on the green economy and care work, food security, population dynamics, and investments for gender-responsive sustainable development. The report comes at a crucial moment, as the global community grapples with the definition of the Sustainable Development Goals and the emergence of the post-2015 framework. Against this context, World Survey 2014 asserts the central role of gender equality in charting the rationale and the actions necessary to achieve sustainable development. The World Survey uses three criteria to assess whether policy actions and investments for sustainable development adequately address gender equality. Do they support women's capabilities and their enjoyment of rights? Do they reduce, rather than increase, women's unpaid care work? And do they embrace women's equal and meaningful participation as actors, leaders and decision-makers? It offers a comprehensive set of recommendations for gender-responsive policy actions and investments towards sustainable development overall, as well as for the selected areas which the World Survey emphasizes.

Golden proudly introduces the Transfer Lift Chair, an innovative chair designed for end users who need assistance transferring from their lift chair to mobility product and back again. Both armrests fl ip back and out of the way, but still remain attached to the chair, making it easy to transfer. Plus, the Transfer Lift Chair is set for the straight lift position, meaning the chair lifts straight up – instead of at an angle.

Treepreneurs – Backyard Nurseries
Rehabilitation of Arayat Watershed
for the Protection of Candaba Wetlands
The Candaba Wetlands and Mount Arayat are considered ecologically important areas. Both ecosystems are habitats of endemic and endangered flora and fauna. Mt. Arayat tributaries drain into the Pampanga River which bisects the whole Candaba swamp area. Sediments from soil erosion on the mountain find its way into the Candaba swamp contributing to its eutrophication. The average depth of the swamp is only 1-2 meters deep, thus making it very vulnerable to sedimentation. The degradation of the Arayat uplands would also mean the deterioration of the habitat of waterfowls and migratory birds of the swamplands. Addressing the conservation issues of the uplands would also help address the degradation of the swamplands. As such the two different ecosystems cannot be separated from each other.
Rehabilitation and conservation of resources of the Arayat-Candaba watershed is of great importance, not only to the flora and fauna, but also to the local people. Conserving the upland and swampland resources could eventually conserve its biodiversity.
The participating farmers in this project called Treepreneurs were members of the Maria Sinukuan Upland Farmers Association in Arayat, Pampanga and their families. The project brought in participation of women and children in tree planting activities, specifically in the establishment of plant nurseries in their backyards. Planting of seedlings and maintenance of the assigned plantation lots at Mount Arayat were done by the Treepreneurs. They received basic goods, school supplies and other household needs in exchange for their efforts. Two groups of Treepreneurs were involved in the project – Treepreneurs for the backyard nurseries (3 batches of 100 families per batch) and Treepreneurs for the enrichment plantation site (2 batches of 80 farmers per batch) known as Punong Buhay Brigade.

Wetlands Caravan
Wetlands Caravan: The Evolving CEPA Action Plan
for the Wise Use of Philippine Wetlands
What is the Wetlands Caravan?
The Wetlands Caravan is the evolving national CEPA Programme of the Philippines for wetlands conservation. The Programme aims to work with the communities in achieving the Ramsar Convention’s goal of “wise use of wetlands” through localized action plans the will help catalyze change in the people’s behavior towards wetlands.
The approach of this program is to steer away from the traditional, informational approach wherein the main concern is to transfer knowledge to the local stakeholders. Instead, it will employ a more participative and community-driven approach, owing to the fact that different communities and stakeholders have their own sets of needs and uses for their wetlands.
The Program works within the framework that was crafted in a workshop on 02 February 2005 as the initial step in the CEPA formulation process. The framework identified the issues confronting wetlands in the country as well as the various key audiences and corresponding key messages. All these have been guided by the global vision as set forth in the Ramsar CEPA Programme which is “People acting for the wise use of wetlands”. The role of the community, through the Wetlands Caravan, is to set its own vision and priorities that they would want to achieve in their own locality. The community can articulate its vision by coming up with action plans directed towards the achievement of that vision.
The Wetlands Caravan is envisioned to be the strategy to translate this framework into actions or activities that will help promote the wise use of wetlands. It will be a venue to exchange information, build capacities and share best practices among different communities. It is through this dynamic interaction that the National Wetlands CEPA Action Plan will evolve – meeting the specific needs of the stakeholders, and will best address the wetland conservation issues of the country.

Approach
The Framework initially sets the vision and guiding principles that should help communities chart their specific CEPA Action Plan. It also identifies key audiences, key messages and communication medium or channels.
The idea is to bring the Wetlands Caravan to at least 20 major priority wetlands for the next five years. This means that these 20 wetlands will have prepared and/or implemented their local CEPA Action Plan by the year 2010. The Wetlands Caravan will ride on the annual theme set by Ramsar Secretariat for World Wetlands Day in setting forth activities that will trigger the preparation of the local CEPA Action Plan.
For the year that the Wetlands Caravan is being launched, the theme was “Livelihoods at Risk: In the face of poverty… wetlands are lifelines.”
Tools
Wetlands Caravan provides a selection of practical tools that can be used to aid in reviewing and planning the CEPA Activity. These tools can be adapted in different situations.
Practical Tool 1 Consequence Wheel
Practical Tool 2 Awareness-to-Action Chain
Practical Tool 3 Dartboard
Practical Tool 4 Matrix
Practical Tool 5 SWOT Analysis
Practical Tool 6 Visioning
Practical Tool 7 Stakeholder Decision Analysis
Practical Tool 8 Example Review and Action Plan Procedure and Timescale
What’s inside the Wetlands Caravan?
The Draft CEPA Framework
Vision:
People acting for the wise use of wetlands.
Goal:
To promote the wise use of wetlands in the
Philippines.
Objectives:
1. To increase the awareness and appreciation for wetlands and their many values and uses.
2. To catalyze change in the behavior of intended audiences towards wetlands.
Guiding Principles:
Wetlands provide important goods and services which help sustain human life, conserve biological diversity, and combat the impacts of climate change and desertification. Communication, education and public awareness (CEPA) are the tools for placing people’s social, political, economic and cultural realities within the context of the goods and services provide by wetland ecosystems.
In formulating such an action plan, the aim should be to:
Ensure that the CEPA programs are fully tailored to all local contexts (environmental, social and economic)
Ensure that the CEPA programs respond effectively to local needs
Adopt participatory approaches, including the fully informed involvement of local and indigenous people and their knowledge in decision-making and implementation
Recognize the benefits of involving skilled personnel from education fields of practice
Make full use of the existing wealth of relevant CEPA expertise located worldwide in different sectors and at different levels of social networks
Identify new opportunities for the application of CEPA
Develop improved CEPA approaches and techniques applicable to wetland wise use goals
It contains templates on the processes or steps to be followed when preparing a participatory local CEPA Action Plan, a very flexible template that can easily be modified according to the type of community one is working with.
Wetlands Issues and Concerns
Inside the Wetlands Caravan are discussions on the major issues and concerns confronting wetlands in the country today to make people understand the dynamics and their relationships with these important ecosystems.
Some of the major concerns include:
problems and threats: habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution (biological and chemical), weak institutional and legal capacities
issues: biotechnology, ecotourism, domestication, bioprospecting
gaps: knowledge, management, policy

世界銀行は、2030年までに極度の貧困を世界全体で3％まで減らす、また、全ての途上国で所得の下位40％の人々の所得拡大を促進する、という2つの目標を掲げており、貧困に関するさまざまなデータを収集・分析しています。
※世界銀行は、2015年10月、国際貧困ラインを2011年の購買力平価（PPP）に基づき、1日1.90ドルと設定しています。
（2015年10月以前は、1日1.25ドル）

よくあるご質問
Q1. データの更新頻度はどのくらいですか？
A1. 世界開発指標 は年1度、4月に更新されますが、オンライン・データは年4回（4月、7月、9月、12月）に更新されます。
オンライン貧困データ分析ツールPovcalNet は年1回4月に更新されます。
Q2. 貧困統計がそれぞれの国に対して必ずしも毎年発表されていないのはなぜですか？
A2. 多くの国で貧困測定に必要な世帯調査が毎年行われていないため、ほとんどの国の貧困統計は、毎年最新版を発表していません。このような理由で、オンラインデータベース上ではデータが欠損している年が多くあります。調査年は国によって異なりますが、一覧で指標をご覧になる場合には、世界開発指標(WDI) の書籍版PDF、又はオンライン・テーブルをご覧ください。
世界開発指標(WDI) 書籍版
世界開発指標(WDI) オンライン・テーブル
Q3. 基軸とする年の全ての国の貧困率データがない場合、世界または地域別の貧困統計はどのように算出されているのですか？
A3. ある年の調査データがない場合には、貧困測定は直近の調査年よりデータを補間しています。
詳細はこちらをご覧ください。：Estimation of Internationally Comparable Poverty Measures (PDF)
Q4. 購買力平価（PPP）とは何ですか？どのように決定されるのですか？
A4. PPPを使うと、各国の所得や消費のデータをグローバルに比較できる数字に転換することが可能です。PPPは、世界各国の物価データを基に割り出されます。その年のPPPを決定する責任は、国際比較プログラム（ICP）が担います。ICPは独立した統計プログラムであり、世界銀行の開発データ･グループの中にICPグローバル･オフィスが設けられています。
詳細はこちらをご覧ください： International Comparison Program (ICP)
Q5. 国際貧困ラインとは何ですか？また、国際貧困ラインを基準とした場合、世界にはどれくらいの極度の貧困層が存在しますか？
A5. 国際貧困ラインとは、貧困を定義するためのボーダーラインで、2011年の購買力平価（PPP）に基づき1日1.90ドルに設定されています。2015年には、極度の貧困層は、世界人口の10%となる7億3,600万人に減少しており、25年間で11億人以上が極度の貧困から脱出しています。
Q6. 国際貧困ラインはどのようにして決定されるのですか？
A6. まず、国別貧困ラインを確認します。その国でそれ以下の収入では、最低限の栄養、衣類、住まいのニーズが満たされなくなるというレベルが、国別貧困ラインです。当然ながら、裕福な国ほど貧困ラインは高く、貧しい国ほど低くなる傾向にあります。
ですが、世界全体の極度の貧困層の数を把握するためには、ただ単に各国の貧困層の数を足せば良いわけではありません。貧困層を定義する基準が国によってそれぞれ異なるからです。そのため、全ての国の貧困層を同じ基準で測定する貧困ラインが必要になります。
1990年、独立した研究者のグループと世界銀行は、世界の貧困層の数を把握するため、最貧国の基準を用いた測定法を提案しました。まず最貧国数カ国の国別貧困ラインを検証し、それを購買力平価（PPP）を用いて共通の通貨価値に 換算するという方法です。PPPとは、ある国である価格で買える商品やサービスが他の国ならいくらで買えるかを示す換算レートです。 共通の通貨に転換すると、これらの最貧国の内6カ国における国別貧困ラインが1人当たり1日約1ドルになることが分かり、これが最初の国際貧困ラインである1日1ドルの根拠となりました。
2005年、各国間の物価に関する比較可能なデータがより多く集められ再度検討が行われた結果、国際貧困ラインは、世界の最貧国の内15カ国の国別貧困ラインを基に改定されました。これら15の国別貧困ラインを平均すると、1人当たり1日1.25ドル（前回同様PPPベース）となり、これが改定後の新たな世界貧困ラインとなりました。
そして2015年に再び、2005年と同じ15の最貧国の国別貧困ラインを用いて（つまり測定基準を変えずに）、1.90ドル（2011年のPPPベース）という新国際貧困ラインへの改定を決定しました。
Q7. 地域別で見た場合の貧困率はどうなっていますか？
A7. 2015年の統計によると、貧困層の半数強がサブサハラ・アフリカ地域に集中しており、85%以上がサブサハラ・アフリカ地域もしくは南アジア地域に、また残りの15％（約1億600万人）がそれ以外の地域に住んでいることになります。サブサハラ地域以外での貧困率の平均値は1.5％から12.4％なのに対し、サブサハラ・アフリカでは約41％が貧困ライン以下となっており、地域別の貧困率には偏りがでています。特に中東・北アフリカ地域での極度の貧困率の増加が顕著となっています。
Q8. 世界銀行の目標は世界の貧困撲滅です。それなのになぜ貧困率の目標値が０ではなく3％とされているのでしょうか？
A8. 貧困撲滅という目標の進捗状況を把握するには、信頼性の高い貧困測定と調査が必要となります。世界での貧困撲滅が進むと、少ない人口から成り立つサンプルはますます減っていくため、測定された数値の精度は低くなります。極端に言うと、サンプル調査によって正確な貧困率ゼロという数値を測定することは出来ません。このような理由から、貧困率3%という数値は、信頼度の高いレベルで測定可能でかつ野心的な目標とされています。
Q9. 2015年時点で最も貧しい国はどこですか？
Q9.南アジア（インド、バングラデシュ）、サブサハラ・アフリカ（ナイジェリア、エチオピア、コンゴ共和国）などの人口の多い国は、極度の貧困層が多い国です。インドの貧困層は、1億7,000万人以上で、その割合は世界の貧困層の約４分の1です。人口13億人に対して貧困率が13.4％という結果は、インドには貧困者層が多数存在することを示しています。しかし、この順位にも変動が見られており、実際に世銀が行った調査では、ナイジェリアがインドを抜いて最貧国であるという結果も出ていますが、順位の変動の時期については、予測データにギャップが生じることから特定は難しい状況です。最新の貧困データは、povertydata.worldbank.orgからご覧いただけます。
Q10. なぜ最新の貧困データは2018年ではなく2015年なのでしょうか？
A10. 貧困データの統計は、164ヵ国を対象にした世帯調査に基づいており、調査は各国の政府によって約3〜5年ごとに実施されています。データの収集、分析は複雑で時間を要するため、2015年が世界全体での貧困データ統計の最新年となっています。また、このようなギャップが存在することを考慮し、世界銀行グループは２年ごとに貧困データの統計を行っています。次回は2020年に2017年の統計を発表する予定です。
Q11 .以前に出した貧困率の予測と、今回発表された貧困率の数値が違うのはなぜですか？
A11 .2015年に発表した、2015年の貧困率9.6％という数値は、予測に基づく数値でした。最新の世帯調査によるデータを収集し分析した結果、10.0％という数値を発表しています。また2016年には2013年の貧困率を10.7％としていますが、同様の理由で11.2％に変化しています。
Q12. 2030年までに極度の貧困を撲滅することは出来ますか？
A12. ここ数年、貧困削減のペースには減速が見られます。2013年から2015年にかけての年間貧困率の減少は0.6ポイントとなっており、また2018年の8.6％という予測は、2018年から2015年にかけては0.5ポイント以下に低下することを想定し算出されています。2030年までに極度の貧困撲滅を達成するには、所得の下位40％の人々を8％以上にまで所得拡大させる必要があります。現在のペースのままでは、2030年までに極度の貧困率は5％を超えることが予想されています。

INDICATION
NEUPRO is a prescription medicine used to treat moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
NEUPRO contains a sulfite called sodium metabisulfite. Sulfites can cause severe allergic reactions that are life threatening to some people who are sensitive to sulfites. People with asthma are more sensitive to sulfites. Remove the patch right away and call your doctor if you have swelling of the lips or tongue, chest pain, or trouble breathing or swallowing.
NEUPRO may make you fall asleep suddenly or without warning while doing normal activities, such as driving, which may result in accidents. Tell your doctor right away if this happens. Drinking alcohol or taking other medicines that cause drowsiness may increase your chances of becoming sleepy while using NEUPRO. Do not drive, use hazardous machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how NEUPRO affects you.
NEUPRO can cause decreases in blood pressure, especially when you start or increase your dose. Increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and fainting, also can occur. If you faint or feel dizzy, nauseated, or sweaty when you stand up from sitting or lying down, tell your doctor.
Some patients using NEUPRO get urges to behave in a way that is unusual for them, such as unusual urges to gamble, strong urges to spend money, binge eating, or increased sexual urges and behaviors. If you or your family notices you are developing any unusual behaviors, talk to your doctor.
NEUPRO may cause Restless Legs Syndrome symptoms to come back (rebound), become worse, or start earlier in the day.
Skin reactions may occur at the site where you apply NEUPRO. Tell your doctor if you get a rash, redness, swelling, or itching that will not go away.
Avoid exposing the NEUPRO patch you are wearing to heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, heated water beds, and direct sunlight. Too much medicine could be absorbed into your body. Also, do not wear NEUPRO during medical procedures called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardioversion because this could cause skin burns.
Tell your doctor if you have breathing problems, a sleep disorder, mental problems, high or low blood pressure, or heart problems; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. NEUPRO may not be right for you.
The most common side effects in people taking NEUPRO for Restless Legs Syndrome are application site reactions, nausea, difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, sleepiness, and headache.
You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to UCB, Inc. at UCBCares™ (1-844-599-2273).
Please see additional Patient Information about the NEUPRO Patch. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your condition or your treatment.

By DIANE PHILLIPS
Long before he became the latest iteration of superhuman James Bond 007, actor Daniel Craig debuted in an often overlooked movie called The Power of One. The plot follows the story of a five-year-old English-speaking white child who, nearly abandoned after his mother suffers a nervous breakdown, is raised by a family very different from himself. Set in South Africa in the 1940s at the height of apartheid, the movie – also starring Morgan Freeman, John Gielgud and Stephen Dorff (of Blade fame) – traces the journey of little Peekay who through the toughest of times, including prison, finds a way to succeed. He learns to play piano from another inmate. His boxing gets better as he grows from tough kid to feisty teen to young man. A newspaper calls him a boxing phenomenon and describes “the power of his punches” as extraordinary for a kid his size.
Ignoring the controversy surrounding whether or not the author of the novel on which the movie was based really spent his childhood in South Africa, the 1992 film gave depth and gravitas to the meaning of the power of one. Its star, a little boy who grows up simply declining to bow to convention, demonstrates a kind of courage that causes us to wonder what is it in his DNA that allowed him to rise above it all?
Why is it that we do not find within ourselves the courage to detach from the expected when we know that we can do better if we do the thing least expected?
The concept of defying convention fascinates me in a way I cannot explain, perhaps because I so rarely do it. Most of us are just plain obedient, we do what is expected and because we want to succeed we go above and beyond what is expected. We work on holidays. We scrub our baseboards because we think they need it though, truth be told, we would live just as good a life if we left a little dust on them. We roast a turkey or make a stew on Sunday when souse would have been so much easier. We drive ourselves because we do not understand the power of one and we fear the consequences of saying “Convention, be damned.”
We also do not want to disappoint others who depend upon us and I suspect that is the main reason we do the expected. The cowardice we display is a reflection of the good in our conscience or as Shakespeare once declared, “Thus doth conscience make cowards of us all.”
But suppose we used the power of one for good? Not for ourselves nor for the sheer desire to defy convention but to do the unconventional and make other lives better.
Someone has just done exactly that. She gave away money, a lot of money, to feed the hungry, help the young whose parents are unable to care for them, nurture students with special needs and provide care and treatment for animals. The funds are going to Bahamian charities. You read about her in yesterday’s Tribune. But you will never know her name and I have never met her so please do not call me if you are reading this and thinking there may be something in it for you or the cause you represent.
She is a stranger to The Bahamas but she is proof that the power of one is real and can make a difference.
We all have the power to make a difference. Because one of my pet peeves is illegal signage on trees and utility poles or snipe signs stuck in the ground that junk up the road and clutter the environment, I have picked up the phone and called those who post such signs on many an occasion. I am proud to give them my name and explain, in case they just did not think about it, the difference the sign makes in changing the beauty of a space. I also tell them it is illegal to post signs for which there is no permit or to post any sign on a utility pole which is the property of the Ministry of Works or a utility company. Most people are surprised. Sometimes they do remove the signs on the very day I call as happened last week when a new landscape company put up a sign on Eastern Road. As a result of the proprietor taking my call and removing the sign that same evening, I am meeting with them to see if I can engage their services or refer business to them. Respect is a two-way relationship. The power of one phone call took very little courage yet netted a positive outcome.
Sometimes you can demonstrate the power of one just by withholding business as I have with others whose attitude in a place of business is so poor that I refuse to return and encourage others to take their business elsewhere.
It is not always as easy as a phone call or a refusal to return. The hardest task in exercising the power of one is attempting to stop abuse when you see it happening, a mother who is yanking a toddler by the arm or pinching them, a father yelling at his son, ”You so stupid, boy, you ain’t never gonna amount to nuttin.” What is the son supposed to believe? Maybe the power of one means we do have to step up, speak out and interfere with others’ lives , accept life is not just about ourselves but about the world around us.
Finding the courage takes courage itself.

Canada's export credit agency is reviewing its environmental and social risk management policies. Given the agency's repeated support for companies facing credible allegations of human rights abuse, environmental damage or other serious harms, such a review is long overdue.

In May, 120,000 people in northwestern Colombia were endangered by the potential collapse of a hydroelectric dam being developed by Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM), a client of Canada’s export credit agency.

In May Indian police shot and killed 13 people who were protesting pollution from a copper smelter owned by Vedanta Ltd, a client of Export Development Canada (EDC).

Luanda — Angolan minister of Justice and Human Rights Francisco Queiroz Wednesday urged parents to register their children in order to ensue an identity and access to basic services such as education and health.
Official data indicate only 25 percent of children under five years of age as having been registered.
Paternity denial is one of the causes of the low number of registered children, according to the programme "Nascer com Registo".
Francisco Queiroz, who quoted a study conducted by his sector and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said that few parents take their kids for registration, leaving the mothers in a situation of abandonment with the children.
The minister was addressing a birth registration campaign called "Responsible Parenting I Support," funded by the European Union and technical support from UNICEF.
The objective of campaign is to raise awareness on the importance of paternity and contribute to the reduction of children without registrations.
The Minister put at 128,000 the number of children registered since the opening of birth registration posts in maternity wards in July 2017.
On the other hand, Secretary of State for Human Rights, Ana Celeste, revealed that the first stage of the campaign runs until June 2019.
Meanwhile, the UNICEF representative in Angola, Abubacar Sultan, thanked the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights for the partnership.
He said the move opens the door so that the motto "Responsible Parenthood" addresses other problems related to protection and development of kid.

(AllHipHop News) Last month, a video of Cardi B ranting about taxes went viral, and conservative pundits praised her for questioning how the government is using the public's money. Now the "I Like It" star has earned applause from progressives for her stance on social security and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"[FDR] helped us get over the Depression, all while he was in a wheelchair," Cardi told GQ. "Like, this man was suffering from polio at the time of his presidency, and yet all he was worried about was trying to make America great—make America great again for real. He's the real 'Make America Great Again,' because if it wasn't for him, old people wouldn't even get Social Security."
In response to those comments, former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders gave the 25-year-old entertainer a shout out on Twitter. The Vermont senator tweeted, "Cardi B is right. If we are really going to make America great we need to strengthen Social Security so that seniors are able to retire with the dignity they deserve."
The Bronx native responded to the Independent politician on Instagram. She wrote, "Oooooommmmmmggggg😱😱😱😰😰BERNIE SANDERS!!!"

The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302.6 million, making them the highest odds of any other state or multi-state lottery game ever played in the United States. However, this means the jackpot can grow to surpass the billion-dollar mark with relative ease. The overall odds of winning any prize are 1 in 24, which is slightly better than that of Powerball, which are 1 in 24.87.
And of course, if non-US residents are eligible to buy the tickets, they are also eligible to claim the prize money should they win. However, be aware that the rules covering taxes and withholding vary depending on where you live. Countries outside of the United States might have different procedures. If you do win, be sure to consult with a tax professional for more information.
Step 9: On the online play slip, choose the draw day you want to enter your numbers for, how many weeks the numbers will be put into the drawer. Then click into each number box and enter your numbers. If you want to choose lucky dip numbers, click on the Lucky Dip button and numbers will be automatically entered into the boxes, but until you complete the transaction you will only see 'LD' in the boxes.
From purchase to payoff, theLotter is secure and simple. Per our Terms of Use, theLotter has no legal claim to your tickets whatsoever -- all winnings are 100% yours. When you buy Powerball tickets online, a confirmation email is sent to you as proof of ticket ownership. After the ticket is physically purchased, you will also be able to see a scanned copy of the ticket in your account as proof-of-purchase. Since our founding in 2002, theLotter has had the privilege of paying out more than $90 million to over 4 million winners.
Even though some scratch cards costing as much as $50 in Texas and $30 in Massachusetts, state lotteries are exempt from Federal Trade Commission “truth in advertising laws” The Federal Communications Commission prohibits the broadcast of lottery advertisements, but has exemptions for lotteries “conducted by a state acting under the authority of state law. Hence, TV commercials like “The Possibilities are Endless.” (Lotteries raise over $70 billion a year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. Profits from the Powerball are used to fund public projects approved by state legislatures.)
11:03 pm – Powerball: The Wednesday, October 3, 2018 Powerball drawing has taken place, and the results are 41-53-59-63-66, and the Powerball is 03. The Power Play number is 3. To see all the ways your ticket can win a prize, please go to the Ways To Win Powerball page, or you can use the Powerball Search page to type the numbers on your ticket and have the USA Mega computer search the past results. We will announce the number of big winners in this drawing, the states they came from, and the next jackpot within the next couple of hours, here on USA Mega. Good luck!

The North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries dispute the findings of these various studies. Lottery retailers are located in areas where people work, not just in low-income neighborhoods, along with grocery stores, the organization says. This is why you will find more lottery outlets in the center of a city, just as you would find more grocery stores and convenience stores, the NASPL adds. Since the New Hampshire lottery was founded in 1964, according to the NASPL, it says lotteries have raised more than $200 billion for government programs in North America.
For a monthly fee, PlayEuroLotto syndicate betting can boost your chances of winning a serious lottery prize dramatically. In a syndicate betting, lottery players pool their lines for a draw and agree to share any prizes won. If any of those lines wins, then you get to share in the prize money. The more shares you bet with, the larger the share of the prize money you win. Acording to the UK National Lottery, 1 in 4 jackpots is won by a syndicate.
Just pay an additional $1 for each LOTTO AMERICA® game you wish to play, and if you win a set cash prize, you’re guaranteed to multiply that amount 2, 3, 4, or 5 times up to $100,000 cash. A multiplier number (2, 3, 4, or 5) is selected at random for each LOTTO AMERICA® drawing. To add All-Star Bonus, simply mark the All-Star Bonus option on your playslip or ask your Retailer to add it to your LOTTO AMERICA® play.

US Powerball is without a doubt the biggest lottery game in the world! Powerball set a world record when it awarded a $1.58 billion jackpot prize in January 2016 to three lucky winners. Powerball came close to breaking that record when it awarded a $758.7 million jackpot in August 2017. Previous huge jackpots include the $590.5 million jackpot awarded in May 2013 and the $564.1 million prize awarded in February 2015. Play Powerball online right now for the chance to become the next big American lottery winner!
EuroMillions is played in 13 countries and territories throughout Europe, with the majority of players coming from the UK, France and Spain. Other participating countries include Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland. EuroMillions is also available to play in Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and the Isle of Man. With players from all over the continent taking part each week EuroMillions is, by far, the biggest and most popular international lottery in the world.
Rules vary according to the applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction where the ticket is sold, and the winner's residence (e.g. if a New Jerseyan wins on a ticket bought near their workplace in Manhattan). Mega Millions winnings are exempt from state income tax in California; while Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington state, and Wyoming do not have an income tax. On the other hand, some residents of New York City and Yonkers, New York pay three levels of income tax, as these cities levy income taxes.
On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.
Lottoland is a bookmaker, and not a lottery operator. You cannot purchase entries in any lottery via Lottoland. Lottoland allows you to bet on the outcome of lotteries from around the world. The website is operated by Lottoland. Lottoland has no relationship or affiliation with the operators of the lotteries. Bets do not contribute to the prize pool. Payouts are made in AUD, exchange rates apply.
In 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.[42]
Ohio and New York joined The Big Game consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed The Big Game Mega Millions, temporarily retaining the old name and the original "gold ball" logo. The "Big Money Ball" became the "Mega Ball." While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read "The Big Game" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first (The Big Game) Mega Millions drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were Washington (in September 2002), Texas (in 2003) and California (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.
Michael Sweeney, executive director of the Massachusetts State Lottery, apologized Thursday afternoon for the mix-up, saying it was the result of a “human error” but added that the lottery’s internal systems always had the correct information. He said those internal systems ran a routine report in the morning identifying Chicopee as the correct location, and lottery officials then checked to ensure that it was accurate.
The lottery never paid out, and it brought to light the prevalent issue of crookedness amongst the lotteries in the United States. The wave of anti-lottery protests finally broke through when, by 1860, all states had prohibited lotteries except Delaware, Missouri, and Kentucky. The scarcity of lotteries in the United States meant that tickets were shipped across the country and eventually led to the creation of illegal lotteries. In 1868, after years of illegal operation, the Louisiana Lottery Company obtained a 25-year charter for its state lottery system. The charter was passed by the Legislature due to immense bribing from a criminal syndicate in New York. The Louisiana Lottery Company was a derived 90% of its revenue from tickets sold across state borders. These continued issues of corruption led to the complete prohibition of lotteries in the United States by 1895. It was discovered that the promoters of the Louisiana Lottery Company had accrued immense sums of money from illegitimate sources and that the Legislature was riddled with bribery.
For a monthly fee, PlayEuroLotto syndicate betting can boost your chances of winning a serious lottery prize dramatically. In a syndicate betting, lottery players pool their lines for a draw and agree to share any prizes won. If any of those lines wins, then you get to share in the prize money. The more shares you bet with, the larger the share of the prize money you win. Acording to the UK National Lottery, 1 in 4 jackpots is won by a syndicate.
Some retailers that sit on state lines often offer both state lotteries with state boundaries clearly marked, since such sales still have to occur in the physical state it is offered. One retailer located along U.S. Route 62that is largely in Sharon, Pennsylvania but has a small portion lying inMasury, Ohio sells both the Ohio Lottery and the Pennsylvania Lotteryat one location. The first modern US joint-state lottery game was formed in 1985 inMaine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In 1988, the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) was formed with Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon,Rhode Island, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia as its charter members; it is best known for Powerball, which was designed to create large jackpots. Another joint lottery, The Big Game (now called Mega Millions), was formed in 1996 by six other lotteries as its charter members.
Include all your natural children, children of your other spouse, legally adopted children and stepchildren who are unmarried under the age of 21 years on the date of your application. You need to includes these children even if you are no longer married to the child's parent, even if the child does not reside with you and/or will not immigrate with you.
The Powerball jackpot was last won on 11 August 2018 when a single ticket purchased in Staten Island, New York, matched the winning numbers to claim the entire $245,600,000 ($147,844,558.62 cash) prize. The winner of the jackpot was identified as Nandlall Mangal, a 42-year-old Guyanese immigrant in the US who vowed to continue working even after the amazing Powerball win.
BoyleSports is operated by BoyleSports (Gibraltar) Limited, company number 112469, of registered address Suite 2B, 143 Main Street, GX11 1AA Gibraltar. BoyleSports is licensed and regulated by the Gambling Commission (Licence No 000-039469-R-319383-001) for customers in Great Britain, and licensed by the Government of Gibraltar and regulated by the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner (RGL 083 & 084) for all other customers.
Lottery winners can choose to receive the money in either an annuity — annual allotments over 30 years — or to get it all at once in a single payment for a smaller amount. For example, the lump sum on the $502 million jackpot would be $301 million, according to lottery site USAMega.com. If a single winner takes the single payment, the federal tax withholding would be over $75 million. Then, there are state taxes too.
The probability and odds can be taken into a mathematical perspective: The probability of winning the jackpot (through October 27, 2017) was 1:(75C5) x (15); that is: 75 ways for the first white ball times 74 ways for the second times 73 for the third times 72 for the fourth times 71 for the last white ball divided by 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, or 5!, and this number is then multiplied by 15 (15 possible numbers for the "Megaball"). Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize are 1:(75C5) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing, however, the odds will still remain the same.
Mega Millions' second-largest jackpot, $648 million, was for the December 17, 2013 drawing. Two winning tickets, one each from California and Georgia, were sold. The holder of the Georgia ticket claimed the next morning; they selected the cash option, which amounted to $173,819,742.50 before withholdings. The holder of the California ticket claimed on January 3, 2014. (The California ticket holder received an equal share, but potentially a larger cash-option amount, as California lottery winnings are exempt from state income tax)."[3][4][5][15] [16]
Mega Millions is notorious for paying out enormous sums to its winners, including 10 jackpots of more than $300,000,000 since it started. It’s simple to play – pick five different numbers, ranging from 1 to 70, then your Mega Ball (any number from 1-25). Like every other lottery, your win will depend on how many numbers match up with the numbers drawn.
On Oct 4, 2015, the Powerball format changed again; the white-ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26. While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24, it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338.[19] The 4+1 prize became $50,000; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million.[20] Three months later, the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot, double the previous record, after 20 consecutive rollovers.[19][21]
The North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries dispute the findings of these various studies. Lottery retailers are located in areas where people work, not just in low-income neighborhoods, along with grocery stores, the organization says. This is why you will find more lottery outlets in the center of a city, just as you would find more grocery stores and convenience stores, the NASPL adds. Since the New Hampshire lottery was founded in 1964, according to the NASPL, it says lotteries have raised more than $200 billion for government programs in North America.

Mega Millions players have the option to activate a multiplier, called Megaplier, in 45 of its 46 jurisdictions; it is functionally similar to Powerball's Power Play; except the latter cannot multiply second prize by 5. (Neither Megaplier nor Power Play are offered in California because its state penal code distinguishes between a "lottery" in which the bank cannot be "broken", and a "banked game" whose bank theoretically could be broken; only a "lottery" was authorized by the state Lottery Act.) By adding $1 to a basic Mega Millions game, to $3, a player has an opportunity to multiply any non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The Megaplier is drawn by the Texas Lottery (before the cross-sell expansion on January 31, 2010, it was the only lottery to offer Megaplier), which is drawn by a random number generator (RNG). The odds for each Megaplier possibility are not uniform.[19]
Due to falling sales of Hot Lotto (whose final drawing was October 28, 2017), a new version of Lotto America became available on November 12, 2017; its first drawing was November 15, 2017. Lotto America is available wherever Hot Lotto was offered at the time of its final drawing (except New Hampshire.) Lotto America is drawn on Wednesday and Saturday nights after 11 p.m. ET/10 p.m. CT. For each $1 play, bettors choose five numbers from 1 through 52, and a "star ball" numbered from 1 through 10, or ask for terminal-generated numbers. For an additional $1 per play, the bettor can add the "All-Star Bonus" option, which multiplies non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, or 5.[1][2][3][4] The minimum Lotto America jackpot is $2 million; however, the game's initial jackpot was $15 million; the 13 members chose to augment the jackpot with funds from Hot Lotto, whose final jackpot was not won.

If you meet these two entry requirements, you can enter the USA Green Card lottery here: Register for the DV-2020 Lottery. Note: This years lottery is called the DV-2020 Lottery, where 2020 means the year where successful applicants can enter the United States of America in January, 2020 after they have won a permanent resident card in the lottery, submitted their immigration forms and participated in a successful green card interview at the Embassy closest to where they live.

Powerball is one of the most popular American Lottery game made for Americans. The lottery is available for the entire world since the beginning of internet. The lottery can be won by guessing the five regular numbers and the Powerball right. The starting amount of the jackpot of Powerball is $40 million.
The other option is to buy single tickets and play alone. Pick your own numbers, play your own tickets and if you win, you win it all! In this scenario, it is advisable to buy lottery tickets online at least 24 hours before the draw will take place. The reason behind this is because in the single ticket scenario, you want to leave enough time for the agents to go to their local store, purchase your ticket, scan your ticket and upload your ticket into your account. If you purchase your Powerball tickets online at the last minute, some online lottery ticket providers will process your payment and if they can’t buy a ticket in time for the draw you wanted, your ticket will be purchased for the following draw. Bear in mind that the nature of a global online lottery with agents scattered around the world is that everyone is working on different time zones. To be sure that your ticket is purchased for the lottery draw you want, ensure that you don’t buy your lottery tickets online at the last minute. This is something that all online lottery players should be aware of as jackpots and odds can change from draw to draw. You need to know that if you are buying Powerball tickets online, which draw your tickets will be entered into.

The acceptance of gambling in the colonies was fairly short-lived by English investors because it was seen as a sign of laziness and as a vice. The investors saw gambling as a root cause of the colonies’ inability to sustain themselves. Lotteries were used not only as a form of entertainment but as a source of revenue to help fund the colonies. The financiers of Jamestown, Virginia, for instance, funded lotteries to raise money to support their colony. These USA lotteries were quite sophisticated for the time period and even included instant winners. Not long after, each of the 13 original colonies established a lottery system to raise revenue. In early American history, legislators commonly authorized lotteries to fund schools, roads, bridges, and other public works. Evangelical reformers in the 1830s began denouncing lotteries on moral grounds and petitioned legislatures and constitutional conventions to ban them. Recurring lottery scandals and a general backlash against legislative corruption following the Panic of 1837 also contributed to anti-lottery sentiments. From 1844 to 1859 alone, 10 new state constitutions contained lottery bans. By 1890, lotteries were prohibited in every state except Delaware and Louisiana.
The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.[2] The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-Power Play) revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.

If you’ve set a monthly budget for lotto tickets, you’ll better your personal odds of winning a prize if you spend your monthly ticket budget on one draw, as opposed to spreading that same amount of money over the entire month of draws. For instance, if your monthly lotto budget is $20.00, rather than buy $5.00 worth of lotto tickets each week, your odds of winning any prize will increase dramatically by spending the entire $20.00 on a single draw.
When the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.

And of course, if non-US residents are eligible to buy the tickets, they are also eligible to claim the prize money should they win. However, be aware that the rules covering taxes and withholding vary depending on where you live. Countries outside of the United States might have different procedures. If you do win, be sure to consult with a tax professional for more information.
Powerball numbers are drawn from two sets of numbers, so the odds of winning a prize are calculated by combining the odds for both sets of numbers for all prize levels. The odds for matching just the Powerball are calculated by combining the odds of selecting the Powerball and the odds of not selecting any of the five numbers from the first set of numbers drawn.
In addition, many people can wait years to get their Green Card. Right now, the shortest wait is about two years. Some people even have to wait twelve years. The Green Card Lottery is a way to skip ahead and avoid that wait. If you qualify, it means the U.S. government needs you in America to help diversify the population. And if you win, you could get your Green Card in a little over a year. Check your eligibility for free by clicking the button below and apply today.
The US Powerball game, arguably one of the most popular and widely-played games in the United States, is a shared jackpot game which is co-ordinated by an NPO formed by an agreement between the various state lotteries. The US Powerball game has become renowned for its impressive $40 million starting jackpot, with the potential of yielding nine-figure jackpot wins.
12. WHAT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION YOU HAVE ACHIEVED, AS OF TODAY? You must indicate which one of the following represents your own highest level of educational achievement: (1) Primary school only, (2) High school, no degree, (3) High school degree, (4) Vocational school, (5) Some university courses, (6) University degree, (7) Some graduate level courses, (8) Master degree, (9) Some doctorate level courses, and (10) Doctorate degree
The applicant must have completed a US High School education or a foreign equivalent of a US High School education. “High School education or its equivalent” means the successful completion of a twelve year course of elementary and secondary education in the United States of America or successful completion in another country of a formal course of elementary and secondary education comparable to completing a 12 year education in the USA. Passage of a high school equivalency examination is not sufficient. It is permissible to have completed one’s education in less than twelve years or greater than twelve years if the course of study completed is equivalent to a US High School education; or
When Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the Megaplier, which was similar to Powerball's Power Play. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without Megaplier on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the Megaplier. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to Megaplier.[8]
If you do find yourself at 11 p.m. ET Tuesday with the winning ticket in your hands, be prepared to keep quiet after that initial scream of joy to your spouse or other loved one, said certified public accountant Daniel Mahler of Gisler & Mahler in Bloomingdale, N.J. And sign your ticket; that establishes it as yours before you go to the nearest lottery office to claim your prize.

The average chief executive of an S&P 500 company made $13.1 million per year in 2016 — equivalent to 347 times more money than the average worker, according to separate data released by Executive Pay Watch, a report conducted by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). “When adjusted for inflation, the average wage has remained stagnant for 50 years,” it found. Given this growing gap between the rich and poor in the U.S. the almost impossible odds of winning, Bernal describes $10, $30 and $50 scratch cards and lottery tickets a “Hail Mary investment strategy for the poor.”

Married children and children 21 years of age or older are not eligible to be included in your DV application. However, according to the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), it may be possible for the child to immigrate with you if the DV application is made before the child turns 21 and the child turns 21 before visa issuance. In such cases, he/she may be protected from aging out and will be treated as if he/she were under 21 years solely for the purpose of processing the visa. However, in order to take advantage of this, the child actually must seek to acquire the immigrant visa within a year of the visa becoming available.
In March 2009, it was reported that New Jersey, already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On Oct 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.[9] In Nov, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.[10][11]

For a monthly fee, PlayEuroLotto syndicate betting can boost your chances of winning a serious lottery prize dramatically. In a syndicate betting, lottery players pool their lines for a draw and agree to share any prizes won. If any of those lines wins, then you get to share in the prize money. The more shares you bet with, the larger the share of the prize money you win. Acording to the UK National Lottery, 1 in 4 jackpots is won by a syndicate.
Other winners in excess of $250 million: On December 25, 2002, Jack Whittaker, president of a construction firm in Putnam County, West Virginia, won $314.9 million ($428 million today), then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery. Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million, receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings.[35]

Lottery winners can choose to receive the money in either an annuity — annual allotments over 30 years — or to get it all at once in a single payment for a smaller amount. For example, the lump sum on the $502 million jackpot would be $301 million, according to lottery site USAMega.com. If a single winner takes the single payment, the federal tax withholding would be over $75 million. Then, there are state taxes too.
Wednesday’s jackpot might have been the second-biggest, but many expected it to actually surpass that $1.6 billion record if that lucky Massachusetts ticket-holder hadn’t hit on the right numbers. That’s because of what Kelly Tabor, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Lottery, calls “jackpot chasers,” casual players who rush out to buy a ticket when the jackpot gets big enough.
On May 18, 2013, the world's largest one-ticket jackpot, an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ($620 million today), was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills, Florida.[33] On June 5, Florida Lottery officials announced the winner: Gloria C. MacKenzie, 84, who purchased the "quick pick" ticket at a Publix supermarket.[34] MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million, before Federal withholding; Florida does not have a state income tax.[34]
As technology improves the rest of the world plays catch up. The technological revolution in the online lottery industry is very similar to that of online casino and online sports betting. The internet 2.0 the internet of things, has created the platform where players from all over the world can feel safe and secure in making payments, and more importantly, receiving the winnings from the lottery they decided to play.

ASDs Family Handout—Financial Assistance and Related Programs for Families
Print, Share, or View Spanish version of this article
Are there programs that offer support for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and their families?
Many children with ASDs are able to get support from programs funded through their state or county. Some examples are financial help, education support, medical care, job skills training, and residential or living services. Some supports are available to all children because of federal laws, such as a free public education, including special education if the child is eligible. Other public benefits are based on need, such as financial or how serious the disability is. Most children with ASDs, especially those who also have intellectual disability, will qualify for these benefits.
Funding for community-based supports has increased over the past 30 years, but states put different amounts of money into these services. Some states have policies and funding to ensure that most children with disabilities, including ASDs, live in family settings. Others fund state facilities, community-based residences, and other places where people with ASDs might live away from their families.
What is Supplemental Security Income (SSI)?
Supplemental Security Income benefits support families who are raising children with disabilities that affect home, school, and community functioning. If a child is eligible based on financial need and level of disability, the family will receive funds monthly to support the child's needs. A family that is not low income but has many children or expenses might qualify for this program too. In most states, the child will then also automatically become eligible for Medicaid, publicly funded health insurance.
What are home and community-based waiver services (HCBWS)?
The most common type of financial support for families is called HCBWS. Home and community-based waiver services funding depends on severity of the child's disability and how it affects the family. Funding may be available to all income levels. However, many states have long waiting lists because unlike SSI, the family's assets are not part of deciding who is eligible. Parents must call their local HCBWS office as soon as their child is diagnosed with an ASD to get on the waiting list. Once the child receives a funded slot, a case manager works with the family on an annual service plan to choose the supports the family needs. These supports may include respite (in-home, center, or camp-based), medical equipment, home remodeling for safety reasons, and other needed supports. Children who qualify for waiver services might also qualify for medical assistance or another public insurance.
What is available in my state?
Because each state has different services, families must call their state or county offices of the departments of health and human services or mental health, or state developmental disabilities organizations. Other sources of local and state information are
Autism Society (www.autism-society.org) local or state chapters
Autism Speaks (www.autismspeaks.org) local or state chapters
Early intervention programs (Go to the National Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center [www.nectac.org] to find early intervention programs in each state.)
Easter Seals Disability Services (www.easterseals.com) (Services for children and adults who have ASDs are available in more than 20 states.)
Local parent groups, eg, Family Voices (www.familyvoices.org), which has individual state pages and contacts on its site
School district special education coordinators (Call your local school to ask for further information.)
Title V agencies in each state (Guide is available at www.amchp.org/AboutTitleV/Documents/UnderstandingTitleV.pdf; a few states provide limited services for children who have ASDs.)
What is a special needs will and trust?
Some public supports (such as SSI) depend on the financial status of the family. Monetary gifts to a child may affect continued eligibility for SSI, so it is important to find out how much money your child can have before accepting a gift or an inheritance for him. However, financial resources can be protected with a special needs will and trust.
A very important part of the will is a statement that says the money a child inherits is to be used only for items and services not covered by Medicaid, SSI, or other federal funding. Not including this statement will result in loss of federal benefits until the inheritance is spent down. In some cases, the person with an ASD may need to repay the government for services provided in the past. Also, siblings’ shares of the inherited money may be at risk. Legal help from an experienced lawyer is needed when developing a special needs will and trust. Various nonprofit and for-profit groups can help parents. Information about special needs trusts is included in the Autism Speaks Transition Tool Kit (www.autismspeaks.org/family-services/tool-kits/transition-tool-kit).

Trump Trusts Putin More than US Intelligence

Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP
Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said in a newly released television interview that President Trump believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's assessment on North Korea's nuclear program over that of US intelligence agencies, The New York Times reports.
"And, essentially, the president said he did not believe that the North Koreans had the capability to hit us here with ballistic missiles in the United States. And he did not believe that because President Putin had told him they did not. President Putin told him that the North Koreans don't actually have those missiles," McCabe revealed during a sit-down with "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday night.
CBS' Scott Pelley asked what US intelligence had said to Trump. McCabe answered that US officials told Trump that Putin's assessment "was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses."
"To which the president replied, 'I don't care. I believe Putin,' " McCabe recalled, having learned of the conversation from an FBI official who had just returned from a meeting at the White House.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation; Medicare Program; Meeting of the Technical Advisory Panel on Medicare Trustee Reports
AGENCY: Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, HHS.
ACTION: Notice of meeting.
SUMMARY: This notice announces a public meeting of the Technical Advisory Panel on Medicare Trustee Reports (Panel). Notice of this meeting is given under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2, section 10(a)(1) and (a)(2)). The Panel will discuss the long-term rate of change in health spending and may make recommendations to the Medicare Trustees on how the Trustees might more accurately estimate health spending in the long run. The Panels discussion is expected to be very technical in nature and will focus on the actuarial and economic assumptions and methods by which Trustees might more accurately measure health spending. Although panelists are not limited in the topics they may discuss, the Panel is not expected to discuss or recommend changes in current or future Medicare provider payment rates or coverage policy.
Meeting Dates: December 13, 2010, 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and December 14, 2010, 8:30 a.m.1 p.m. e.t.
ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services headquarters located at 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, Maryland 21244, Conference Room B.
Comments: The meeting will allocate time on the agenda to hear public comments. In lieu of oral comments, formal written comments may be submitted for the record to Donald T. Oellerich, OASPE, 200 Independence Ave., SW., 20201, Room 405F. Those submitting written comments should identify themselves and any relevant organizational affiliations.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald T. Oellerich (202) 6908410, Don.Oellerich@hhs.gov. Note: Although the meeting is open to the public, procedures governing security procedures and the entrance to Federal buildings may change without notice. Those wishing to attend the meeting must call or e-mail Dr. Oellerich by Thursday, December 9, 2010, so that their name may be put on a list of expected attendees and forwarded to the security officers at HHS Headquarters.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Topics of the Meeting: The Panel is specifically charged with discussing and possibly making recommendations to the Medicare Trustees on how the Trustees might more accurately estimate the long term rate of health spending in the United States. The discussion is expected to focus on highly technical aspects of estimation involving economics and actuarial science. Panelists are not restricted, however, in the topics that they choose to discuss.
Procedure and Agenda: This meeting is open to the public. The Panel will likely hear presentations from Medicare public trustees on issues they wish the panel to address. This may be followed by HHS staff presentations regarding long range growth. After any presentations, the Panel will deliberate openly on the topic. Interested persons may observe the deliberations, but the Panel will not hear public comments during this time. The Panel will also allow an open public session for any attendee to address issues specific to the topic.
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 217a; Section 222 of the Public Health Services Act, as amended. The panel is governed by provisions of Public Law 92463, as amended (5 U.S.C. Appendix 2), which sets forth standards for the formation and use of advisory committees.
Dated: December 2, 2010.
Sherry Glied,
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.

Forty-four states have specific regulatory provisions for facilities serving people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, an increase from 36 in 2002 and 28 in 2000. Examples of state activities regarding dementia care and the regulations for facilities serving residents with dementia follow.
Rhode Island requires a license for dementia care when one or more resident's dementia symptoms affect their ability to function as demonstrated by behaviors that adversely impact the rights of others; elopement; or an inability to self-preserve. Facilities that advertise or represent special dementia services or that segregates residents with dementia also need a license for dementia care. In addition to basic license requirements dementia care licenses require staff training specific to dementia care; a RN on staff and available for consultation at all times; and a secure environment appropriate for the resident population.
Pennsylvania has drafted rules that contain provisions for securing units and providing adequate indoor and outdoor wandering space. They also specify competency-based training requirements for administrators and staff covering mandated topics such as the definition and diagnosis of dementia, differences between dementia, delirium, and depression, managing behavioral symptoms, and working with family members.
Montana created a new licensure category for facilities that serve residents who are not capable of expressing their needs or making basic decisions. Requirements include staffing provisions; general staff education, training, and experience requirements; dementia specific annual continuing education requirement, including the teaching of skills necessary to care for, intervene and direct residents who are unable to perform ADLs; and techniques for minimizing challenging behavior. Other requirements apply to locked units or distinct parts of facilities.
Washington revised its regulations to require staff with experience and training in dementia care to coordinate outside services, offer monthly educational and family support meetings, and advocate for residents. Staff training requirements include a minimum of 30 hours on care for residents with dementia; nature, stages, and treatment of the disease; therapeutic interventions; communication techniques; medication management; therapeutic environmental modifications; assessment and care planning; the role of family and their need for support; staff burn-out prevention; and abuse prevention. Eight hours of continuing training is required annually.
Staff must be able to provide 2.25 hours of direct care per resident per day. At least two staff must be present for units serving more than five residents. An RN must be available if residents require nursing procedures. The rules describe special requirements for the physical environment with security measures, including secured outdoor spaces.
Licensed facilities that do not market themselves special care units but serve residents with early symptoms of dementia must provide staff training on dementia care, including strategies to help residents manage their behaviors.
Disclosure
Twenty-four states have disclosure requirements for facilities that advertise themselves as operating special care facilities or units, or that care for people with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. These facilities are required to describe in writing how they are different from other facilities. The regulations may require a description of the philosophy of care, admission/discharge criteria, the process for arranging a discharge, services covered and the cost of care, special activities that are available, and differences in the environment. See Table 1-5 for an overview of disclosure requirements. Specific examples of regulations regarding disclosure requirements follow.
California has a voluntary disclosure process for facilities offering special services for people with dementia. The state developed a consumer's guide that alerts family members to key questions that should be asked when seeking residential care for people with dementia. They include how the program meets the needs of people with Alzheimer's; the facility's pre-admission assessment process; the transition from the individual's current living arrangement to residential care; the care and activities that will be provided; staffing patterns and the special training received by staff.
Illinois' standard disclosure form, which all providers must use, addresses the form of care or treatment; philosophy; admission and retention policies; assessment care planning and implementation guidelines; staffing ratios; physical environment; activities; family members' roles; and the cost of care.
Minnesota adopted disclosure requirements in 2001, which require facilities to provide information about the form of care or treatment; the treatment philosophy; unique features for screening, admission and discharge; assessment and care planning; staffing patterns; the physical environment; security features; type and frequency of activities; opportunities for family involvement; and the costs of care.
Texas requires a disclosure statement that describes the nature of the care or treatment provided the pre-admission and admission processes, discharge and transfer policies, the planning and implementation of care, policies related changes in residents' condition, staff training on dementia care, the physical environment, and staffing.
Staffing and Training
Thirty-six states have requirements for dementia specific training and staffing for facilities serving people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Examples follow.
In Alabama, staff in specialty care facilities must complete a training program developed by the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and receive six hours of ongoing training a year on topics specified in the regulations.
Arizona requires staffing ratios of one staff per six residents during the morning and evening, and one per twelve residents at night.
Indiana requires six hours of training for direct service workers within 6 months of employment and three hours annually.
Rhode Island requires new direct service workers to receive at least twelve hours of orientation and training about dementia, communicating effectively with dementia residents, and managing problem behaviors. The state also requires that a RN be available to residents on site as needed, and available for consultation at all times.
Massachusetts, Nevada, and Oklahoma require 24-hour coverage by awake staff.

Assisted Living Cathedral City
Cathedral City city is located in Riverside County, California State, US.
Assisted living in Cathedral City as it exists today emerged in the 1990s as an California eldercare alternative on the continuum of care for people, for whom independent living is not appropriate but who do not need the 24-hour medical care provided by a nursing home and are too young to live in a retirement home. Assisted living is a philosophy of care and services promoting independence and dignity.
Cathedral City Time Zone is PST and Area code, to make phone calls to a Cathedral City Assisted Living Home, is 760
Search for Cathedral City, CA assisted living facilities by their name or address
Cathedral City Assisted Living - California
Zip Code is 92234 and Currently there are 2 assisted living homes and senior care homes in our database for Cathedral City City.
A distinction is generally made between Cathedral City medical and non-medical care, care provided by people who are not medical professionals. The latter is much less likely to be covered by insurance or public funds. In the US, 67% of the one million or so residents in assisted living facilities pay for care out of their own funds. The rest get help from family and friends and from state agencies. Medicare does not pay unless skilled-nursing care is needed and given in certified skilled nursing facilities or by a skilled nursing agency in the home.
Cathedral City Assisted living facilities usually do not meet Medicares requirements. However, Medicare does pay for some skilled care if the elderly person meets the requirements for the Medicare home health benefit.

Jun 11 Affordable primary care at Avenu Health attracts uninsured
News	
via WLOS
By Jay Siltzer, WLOS
June 11, 2018
https://avenuhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affordable-primary-care-at-Avenu-Health-attracts-uninsured.mp4
ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) — People without health insurance and those with high deductibles are finding affordable health care in Asheville.
Through Avenu Health, a Mission affiliate, patients can pay a monthly fee for primary care that includes lab work.
Self-employed restaurateur Anthony Dorage cannot afford health insurance. But, that is no longer keeping him away from the doctor since Avenu Health opened in Asheville.
“This is a very comfortable environment,” 58-year-old Dorage said. “It’s not rushed.”
“It’s saving me money,” he added.
“What we do is take insurance out completely and replace it more or less a membership model,” explained Dr. Ben Aiken, a family medicine physician. “So, we try to embed everything you would need in primary care in a membership model.”
Here’s the cost:
Patients 0 to 25 pay $50 per month.
Patients 26 to 64 pay $70 a month.
The monthly fee is bank drafted.
“So, you get up to 40 in-person visits with me per year,” Aiken said. “You can access me by text 24/7, video, or true virtual visit.”
“I’ve been here three times, did my first consultation and they spent two hours talking with me about my history, my health, my well-being at the current state,” Dorage said.
Under the model, doctors have a limited number of patients but insist the practice can make money because no staff is needed to file insurance or handle billing.
Providers at Avenu Health say their patients should still have insurance for catastrophic situations, like emergency hospitalization, oncology care, and orthopedic surgery.

Cancers 'rising around the world'
Thu, Sep 13, 2018 5:15 PM
One in five men and one in six women around the world develop cancer during their lifetime, according to the latest figures from the from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). One in eight men and one in 11 women die from the disease.
There will be 18.1 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million people will die with the disease this year worldwide, a report predicts. The rise, from 14.1 million cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012, is partly due to a growing and ageing population.
The figures suggest one in five men and one in six women will develop the disease in their lifetime. And as countries become wealthier, more people get cancers related to lifestyle rather than those linked to poverty.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) provides regular snapshots of the scale of cancer around the world, looking closely at 36 different cancers in 185 countries.
Researchers say while ways of measuring and collecting cancer data have improved over the years, the overall trend is that cancer rates and deaths have risen year on year.
The latest report suggests lung cancer, female breast cancer, and bowel cancer are responsible for a third of all cancer cases and deaths worldwide.
In more affluent parts of the world with good healthcare systems, it is preventable cancers with causes rooted in our lifestyles and modern culture that dominate. Most lung cancers are caused by smoking, while the causes of breast cancer include obesity and alcohol.

OVERVIEW
In this online program, you will master all the skills you need to begin a career as a professional interpreter. You will learn what public services interpreting entails, identify the responsibilities of a professional interpreter, and develop the skills to be an efficient interpreter and communicator. By the end of the program, you'll be fully prepared to begin working as a professional interpreter in the public services setting.
OBJECTIVE
Upon completing this program, you will be a completely competent Public Services Interpreter. You will also be prepared to continue to train as a legal and/or medical interpreter to increase your opportunities and earning potential in the field.
DETAILS
Are you hoping to use your bilingual skills to start a new career or supplement your income? This program will enable you to develop the skills necessary to use your knowledge of languages to help other people communicate.
You'll start by gaining a clear understanding of what interpreting is; the different interpreting techniques, settings, and delivery modes; and the differences between a career in public services interpreting and other language-related fields.
Next, you'll work toward acquiring the skills you need to start interpreting. You will:
Become an effective communicator.
Master listening skills.
Learn how to transfer information in multicultural situations.
Develop interpreting-specific skills such as short-term memory retention, shadowing, note-taking, sight-translation, consecutive interpreting, and more.
You will also receive a thorough grounding in the principles of ethics and professional conduct as they apply to the interpreting field. In addition, you'll learn how to control the communication flow of an interpreting encounter to ensure that all parties are recognized and heard during the meeting.
With this solid foundation, the program prepares you for the real world by providing you with practical information to help you gain employment confidently as a public services interpreter. You will also have the option to be listed for free in an employer-searchable directory to jump-start your new career.
Once you complete the program, you'll be prepared to embark upon an exciting and rewarding career. As a professional interpreter, you'll often work with immigrants in vulnerable situations, becoming their only communication bridge. You can expect to assist families as they apply for food stamps and Medicaid, help residents set up utility services in a new home, and assist refugees as they complete their applications. You'll find your assignments vary from day to day—sometimes even from hour to hour—and opportunities abound!
Upon registering, you are given six months to complete this program.

FAQS
1. Can I register for programs if I am an international student?
Yes, because ed2go programs are online you never have to actually travel to the school. Most schools offer telephone or online registration.
2. How long does it take to complete a program?
All of our programs are self-paced and open enrollment, so you can start them when you want and finish them at your own pace. Upon registering, you are given six months to complete this program.
3. Do I have to buy additional materials?
All the materials you'll need are included, and their cost will be covered by your tuition. ed2go will ship all materials ground service upon enrollment.
4. Can I get financial assistance?
ed2go courses are non-credit courses, so they do not qualify for federal aid. In some states, vocational rehab or workforce development boards will pay for qualified students to take our courses.
5. What happens when I complete the program?
Upon successful completion of the program, you will be awarded a certificate of completion.
6. Am I guaranteed a job?
ed2go programs will provide you with the skills you need to obtain an entry-level position in most cases. We don't provide direct job placement services, but our facilitators and career counselors will help you build your resume and are available to give advice on finding your first job. Facilitators will also be available to use as a professional reference upon completion of the program. Potential students should always do research on the job market in their area before registering.
7. Who will be my instructor?
Each student is paired up with a facilitator for one-on-one interaction. The facilitator will be available (via e-mail) to answer any questions you may have and to provide feedback on your performance. All of our facilitators are successful working professionals in the fields in which they teach.
8. What software or hardware do I need in order to take online programs and what are the system requirements?
In order to take our online programs, you must have access to a computer and the Internet. You can access the program contents from any Web-enabled computer. You don't have to use the same computer to log-in to the program every time. We recommend that you have a word-processing program (Microsoft Word is best) and the latest version of Internet Explorer.
9. Can I use a Mac?
Yes, you can use a Mac for this program.
10. How can I get more information about the program?
If you have questions that are not answered on our website, please feel free to contact us via LIVE chat (click the button toward the top of the page). If you are visiting us during non-business hours, please feel free to send us a question using the "Contact Us" form to the right. You may also call us at 1-855-520-6806. We will answer your questions promptly.
11. When can I start the program?
Our programs are all open enrollment. You can register and start the program as soon as you are ready.
Please note: Once the program curriculum is accessed online or through submission of a material shipment confirmation, refunds cannot be issued.
12. What are the language combinations?
English plus any other language.
13. Am I certified when I finish the program?
No. You will have a Certificate of Completion/Diploma. This means that you can begin working as a professional interpreter, but you cannot say that you are certified. You can say that you are a "trained" interpreter. (The situation is similar to someone who has a degree in accounting: The person could work as a bookkeeper, but is not an accountant until passing the CPA exam.) This program gives you the foundation for future specialized coursework in medical and judicial interpreting (certification exams exist in these disciplines in some countries). The difference is, this program will enable you to become a general interpreter just as soon as you complete it.
14. How much can I earn when I finish the program?
Immediately after you finish the program, you can begin accepting interpreting assignments. The average hourly rate for new interpreters is $20 per hour. Simply follow the instructions in the career module of the Professional Interpreter program and you will be on your way to accepting interpreting assignments right away.
15. Is there a language test?
Yes. As part of your program, you will be required to take a spoken language fluency assessment in both your "A" Language (native language) and your "B" Language (second language). These tests are included in your tuition cost and are conducted over the phone. Certified testers will have a conversation with you in your languages, designed to assess your level of fluency on a 1-5 scale. You must have a fluency level of at least 3 in that scale in both languages to pass. If you do not obtain a level 3 fluency qualification in both languages, you will not pass the program. In order to be an interpreter, you must have full verbal fluency in two (or more) languages.
16. What if I don't have enough time to complete my program within the time frame provided?
The time allotted to complete your program has been calculated based on the number of hours for each program, so don't worry too much about not completing in time. If, after a concerted effort, you are still unable to complete, your Student Advisor will help you work out a suitable completion date. Please note that a fee may be charged for an extension.

Views:
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) thinks that the some of the massive wildfires in Arizona are the fault of illegal immigrants.
"We are concerned about, particularly, areas down on the border where there is substantial evidence that some of these fires are caused by people who have crossed our border illegally," the former Republican presidential candidate said at a press conference Saturday. "They have set fires because the want to signal others. They have set fires to keep warm and they have set fires in order to divert law enforcement agents and agencies from them."
"The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border," he added.
UPDATE: John Amato:
John McCain, who once led an effort for immigration reform until he was beat back by Rush Limbaugh, FOX News and hate talk AM radio now has joined them in their demonization of illegals. We don't know what caused the fires in Arizona as of yet, but McCain saw an opportunity and grabbed it.
The Arizona senator, however, did not say what the evidence is, prompting a swift rebuke from Latino civil rights advocates.
"It's easier to fan the flames of intolerance, especially in Arizona," said Randy Parraz, a civil rights advocate who ran unsuccessfully against McCain as a Democratic candidate in 2010.
Parraz called McCain's remarks "careless and reckless" but not entirely surprising given the political climate in Arizona. The Latino advocate is co-founder of Citizens for a Better Arizona, a group trying the recall the legislator who authored the state's controversial anti-illegal immigration law.
Parraz said McCain "should know better" than to make such an accusation without presenting any facts.
-
Parraz said it is particularly distressing that immigrants are being blamed for destructive fires at a time when many are also being targeted given the state's unemployment, foreclosure and other economic issues.
"People are looking for someone to blame," he said, claiming it is too easy and convenient to target what he called one of Arizona's "most vulnerable populations."
Angelo Falcon, the president of the National Institute for Latino Policy, criticized McCain for what he called "increasingly blatant" political opportunism. "The degree of irresponsible political pandering by Sen. McCain has no limits," Falcon said in an email to CNN. "With the lack of evidence, he might as well also blame aliens from outer space for the fires."

Following Coach’s Complaint, Keenum Turns Careless Against Browns
December 17, 2018 at 2:56 pm
Filed Under:Case Keenum, Denver Broncos, John Elway, Vance Joseph
DENVER (AP) — Case Keenum wasn’t the cautious quarterback his coach complained about last week. Instead, he was the careless one who made Broncos fans wonder why John Elway had spent $36 million to replace the much cheaper and just as effective Trevor Siemian.
The Broncos (6-8) were eliminated from playoff contention Sunday, marking the third consecutive year they’ve failed to reach the playoffs since winning Super Bowl 50.

Keenum threw two costly interceptions in Denver’s 17-16 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Saturday night when he topped 200 yards passing for the first time in a month, but didn’t throw any touchdown passes.
It was his first game since coach Vance Joseph called him out publicly for agonizing so much over avoiding interceptions that he was passing up opportunities downfield.
Ball security had topped Keenum’s to-do list after he started the season with 10 interceptions in his first eight games with his new team, especially after injuries and a trade robbed him of his top two tight ends, top two receivers and three starting interior offensive linemen.
But these weren’t the chances Joseph wanted him to take.
Jabrill Peppers picked off Keenum’s floater into the end zone to rookie Courtland Sutton from the Cleveland 29 late in the second quarter.

“First one, it was man coverage. Heck, when we’re in field-goal range, I’ve got to be more careful with the ball,” Keenum said after the Broncos’ second straight loss to a sub-.500 team. “Trying to give them a chance and the kid made a heck of a play, coming from the middle of the field, intercepting that one. I need to get that ball up and down a little bit sooner.”
The other interception , by T.J. Carrie, proved even costlier.

— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 16, 2018
It came one play after Von Miller’s franchise record-breaking sack of Baker Mayfield got Denver’s defense off the field to regroup one play after they lost their fourth and fifth cornerbacks when Bradley Roby left with a cut in his mouth and newly signed Jamar Taylor was ejected for throwing a punch.
What the Broncos needed right then was a long drive chewing up yards and clock so defensive coordinator Joe Woods could assess and settle his scrambled secondary.
Instead, Keenum’s awful throw sent Miller & Co. right back onto the field with safeties in coverage and Mayfield led the Browns 48 yards in six plays, hitting Antonio Callaway with what proved to be the game-winning touchdown from the 2 with safety Justin Simmons in helpless pursuit.
“The second was just a really poor read by me,” Keenum said. “We were feeling good, wanted to take a shot, and they did a good job disguising the coverage. They rolled to a different form of cover-2, and I didn’t see the corner. It’s not an excuse, but it’s ultimately what lost us the football game because they went down and scored right after that.”
The Broncos were driving for the go-ahead touchdown when they stalled at the Cleveland 6 when Phillip Lindsay, who gained 2 yards on second-and-3, was stuffed for no gain on a third-and-1 toss.
Instead of going for it on fourth down, Joseph trusted his depleted defense more than his inept offense.

He sent Brandon McManus out for a short field goal that made it 17-16 with 4:35 remaining, trusting that his defense, which was down to one healthy cornerback, another spitting up blood, three sidelined with injuries and one ejected for throwing a punch, would get the stop.
Keenum wanted Joseph to go for it on fourth-and-1.
“I felt confident. I wanted to convert third down, that’s what I wanted to do,” Keenum said. “But he felt like the defense could get a stop and get the ball back, and they did. They got a stop, we got the ball back. So, I can’t complain because I had the ball in my hands with a chance to win the game. It’s all I can ask for.”
The Broncos got the ball back at their 13 with 1:49 left when the Browns went all in, but Nick Chubb was stuffed on fourth-and-1 by Adam Gotsis.

The Broncos reached the 50-yard line with 52 seconds left, but Keenum spiked the ball on first down, then threw two incompletions before getting sacked by Peppers to seal Denver’s first loss to Cleveland since 1990.
The Broncos will have to win at Oakland on Christmas Eve and beat the Chargers on Dec. 30 to avoid the franchise’s first back-to-back losing seasons since 1971-72.

Dr Edward Lemon has published an article entitled “Extremism Trends in Tajikistan” in European Eye on Radicalization. In the article, Dr. Lemon discusses the terrorist threat in Tajikistan in the aftermath of an Islamic State attack in July which left four tourists dead. A DMGS-Kennan Institute Fellow at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School, Dr. Lemon brings with him knowledge of authoritarian governance, religion, security, and migration in Eurasia. Based on over six years of research on extremism in Tajikistan, Dr. Lemon highlights the main patterns in the recruitment of citizens to terrorist groups and outlines the main threats to security going forward: homegrown radicalization and the diversion of foreign fighters from the Middle East to neighboring Afghanistan.
Dr. Lemon writes, “The government of Tajikistan claims that since 2011, 1,899 citizens have joined terrorist groups in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, with most choosing Islamic State. A further 2,615 were stopped while trying to cross the Turkish-Syrian border. This record would make Tajikistan one of the world’s largest per capita producers of foreign fighters, on a par with Tunisia and Jordan. Tajikistan also tops the list of foreign fighter suicide bombings by Islamic State.”
Established in early 2018, European Eye on Radicalization draws attention to current dynamics of extremism and terrorism in Europe and its neighboring regions. It offers a platform for top terrorism scholars from across the globe to publish short analytical articles about their latest research and respond to current events.
Like all our faculty, Dr. Lemon’s expertise benefits our students by allowing them to hear insight from an active practitioner, who remains on top of the latest developments in the subjects he teaches. Our program chairs, professors, and adjunct faculty have extensive and successful backgrounds in national security. DMGS provides unique academic training that helps students to understand international security challenges from regions across the globe.

RST 644, POLITICS & STATECRAFT OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
While threats of the 20th century arose from powerful nation states, the key dimensions of the future – globalization, multi-national violent conflicts, and the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction mean great dangers from the relative weak states and ungoverned areas of Africa. Globalization enhances the awareness of the world to the most basic events, making speed of analysis and decision making more important and the consequences more significant. The objective of this course is to transform how professionals think about Africa and its interactions with the rest of the world.
INT 714, COUNTER INTELLIGENCE
The aim of this course is to show how counterintelligence activity protects US national security by 1) defending against acts of penetration, sabotage, and physical violence undertaken by foreign intelligence agencies and 2) defeating an adversary’s efforts by identifying and manipulating its behavior through deception and/or the exploitation of its agents. The course addresses the relationship between the intelligence and law enforcement communities as well as between civilian and military agencies. It also emphasizes the increasing importance of cyber espionage and economic espionage in an age of globalization.
Through this course, students will
Analyze methods to defend against foreign and domestic espionage;
Elaborate the use of deception to defeat other actor’s intelligence capabilities;
Examine the role of espionage and counterintelligence as means of achieving national goals;
Assess the growing relationship between the intelligence and law enforcement communities and the relationship between civilian and military agencies;
Evaluate the role of counterintelligence in cyber espionage and economic espionage;
Communicate ideas clearly, concisely, and effectively in writing, discussions, and presentations
NSC 732, LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT
The course is a detailed examination of the theory and practice of conflict in circumstances less than general conventional war. Key concepts and strategic principles pertaining to asymmetric warfare, terrorism, insurgency and counterinsurgency, irregular warfare, unconventional warfare, and military operations less than war (peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance) will be examined. This course examines the causes, conduct, patterns, and effects of conflict short of total or general war. It covers the modern insurgency period from Mao Tse Tung’s approach in the Chinese Civil War through our present times with the Global Jihad.
It asks four fundamental questions in the U.S. context:
What is modern war in today’s contemporary operating environment?
What paths has it traveled in the post-World War II era into the early 21st Century?
What are the trends and where is it headed
RST 727, RUSSIAN POLITICS AND STATECRAFT
This survey course on Russian politics and statecraft addresses enduring questions on: patterns of cooperation and confrontation with other great powers, a centrally dominated economy, and a political culture that exploits weak formal political institutions to sustain a very small leadership ground. In addressing these issues, we ask: What are the wars that have defined Russia’s borders? When and why do Russian leaders challenge other states? What does power in Russia look like? Who are the rulers and their supporters? How do they obtain, practice, and lose power?
In reviewing the origins and practices of Russian statecraft, we will assess when Russia as a great power has been (dis-) satisfied with the international distribution of economic and political benefits, and when it has sought to revise or maintain the international order. We will use this knowledge to address current issues in Russia’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic alliance and other world powers, including contentious issues such as money laundering, sanctions regimes, “information wars,” and Russia’s declared and undeclared conflicts.
NSC 601, INTRODUCTION TO NATIONAL SECURITY
This course is divided into four parts. Part I will focus on generally accepted concepts of deception and counter deception with an emphasis on the underlying concepts that enable operational and strategic deceptions. Part II is designed to introduce the student to operational level deception and its impact on national decision making and warning. Part III will build upon parts one and two in order to facilitate the construction of a holistic model for Russian Strategic Deception and Information Confrontation. Part IV will move beyond strategic military and information confrontation and analyze strategic-political deception and provocations and apply previous concepts to a detailed analysis of current events.
INT 746, CYBER INTELLIGENCE
This course examines the vast frontier of Cyberspace and the Internet over which travels ever increasing amounts of information and communications. This new dimension of power has strong positive and negative implications for U.S. national security strategy and policy. For national security, Cyberspace represents a unique challenge, as it has no borders or boundaries unlike previous power dimensions — land, sea, air and space. Past separations between government and the private sector and national security and law enforcement have been blurred. Cyberspace also represents an arena where a non-state actor’s powers can equal or exceed any nation state. And, 20th Century based government institutions often have trouble reacting to its 21st century instantaneous speed, ubiquity and volume.
By the end of the course, the student will be able to:
Address the issues of volume, velocity and veracity of information in cyber space and how they relate to intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination in both the public and private sector;
Evaluate the ability of non-nation state players to effect national and corporate security;
Understand the challenges of devising systems to secure the current internet;
Examine the legal and politic implication of a system without borders
RST 643, THE CONTEMPORARY MIDDLE EAST: A NEW LOOK AT CHANGING REGIONAL DYNAMICS
This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the changing regional dynamics of the Middle East. The region serves as the primary source for international energy consumption, yet remains an epicenter of instability, radicalism and terrorism. The 2010 Arab uprisings, Iran’s quest for nuclear capability and the rapid expansion of Islamic State have greatly increased the volatility by threatening the sovereignty and territorial integrity of regional states. A resurgence of political Islam and growing sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shiites add to the regional disorder. Middle Eastern states too weak to control their territory lack the legitimacy or kinetic ability to exert full control over their borders. In these fragile areas, state and non-state threats thrive and pose tremendous national security challenges and concerns for the region and beyond.
The course will examine the national security challenges facing Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians, and analyze how recent shifting political, social, and economic dynamics impact them. The course will focus on the regional actors’ attitudes of the challenges and threats they face and on the strategies they have chosen to confront them. It thus provides critical perspective to students seeking a more comprehensive understanding of the changing Middle Eastern landscape and foreign policy. The course is designed for students interested in the Middle East, particularly those interested in national security issues, students of comparative politics and future practitioners, with a curiosity in regional studies.
INT 639 – RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
This course examines the vast frontier of Cyberspace and the Internet over which travels ever increasing amounts of information and communications. This new dimension of power has strong positive and negative implications for U.S. national security strategy and policy. For national security, Cyberspace represents a unique challenge, as it has no borders or boundaries unlike previous power dimensions — land, sea, air and space. Past separations between government and the private sector and national security and law enforcement have been blurred. Cyberspace also represents an arena where a non-state actor’s powers can equal or exceed any nation state. And, 20th Century based government institutions often have trouble reacting to its 21st century instantaneous speed, ubiquity and volume.
By the end of the course, the student will be able to:
Qualitative Research Methods
Quantitative Research Methods;
Critical Thinking and Complexity Theory; and
Writing Workshop
The overall objectives/learning outcomes are to:
Equip students with the ability, skills and knowledge to conduct and produce quality research in the rapidly changing environment of 21st social science; and
Prepare students to utilize skills to evaluate and analyze a wide variety of social science situations in order to develop and enact new policy solutions to contemporary problems.
Quantitative and Quantitative Research Methods
The objectives/learning outcomes for the sections on qualitative and quantitative research methods are to equip students with an understanding, expertise and ability to apply the most important contemporary research methods currently in use in the social sciences.
Critical Thinking and Complexity Theory
The objectives/learning outcomes for the section on critical thinking and complexity theory are to equip students with an understanding, expertise and ability to conduct research and apply solutions to the most complex social science issues in the increasingly interdependent, globalizing world.
Writing Workshop
The objectives/learning outcomes for the writing workshop are to direct students to apply the methods and skills they learned in the three previous sections, to improve their writing skills and to help prepare them for the research and preparation of their masters’ thesis and set in place the ability to produce quality work in the future.
MDV 650, FOUNDATIONS OF MANAGING DISRUPTION AND VIOLENCE
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training to help students gain a better understanding of the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes organizations need to address the potential or active threat of disruptive or violent group behavior. MDV 650 integrates a broad overview of the material included in MDV 700 Integrated Risk Value Concepts and MDV 701 Causal Analytics for the non-MDV major. The Integrated Risk Value© (IRV) methodology provides the practical skills needed to develop and manage successful persuasive communications programs. MDV 650 is a prerequisite for non-MDV majors to take MDV 702 Strategy for Managing Disruption and Violence.
NSC 707 – U.S. MILITARY STRATEGY
Globalization, the IT revolution, and ethno-nationalist and religious tensions have altered traditional conceptions of warfare. This course will accordingly analyze the effects of current global political, economic, and technological trends on US military plans and operations. It will address the need for less unilateralism and more coalitions of the willing in future as well as closer integration of civilian and military leadership in counterinsurgency and nation-building operations.
The course will also address the importance of winning “the war of perception” among democracies, which increasingly oppose casualties and challenge the lawfulness of warfare, domestic budgetary issues, and the strategic implications of doing more with less. There will be special emphasis on US Naval Strategy.
The objectives of this course are:
Identify the major concepts in the history of strategy;
Examine the particular importance of Clausewitz;
Survey the critical role of technology in winning wars;
Evaluate the challenges faced by the United States at a time of budget constraints and the unprecedented rise of non-state actors; and
Demonstrate the ability to communicate ideas clearly, concisely, and effectively in writing, discussions, and presentations.
INT 712, COLLECTION, ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION
This course provides a critical overview of the Intelligence Cycle – from collection to analysis to presentation. The course assesses intelligence-gathering techniques and approaches for various types of information including HUMINT, SIGINT, etc. It then acquaints students with aspects of Intelligence Analysis; the evaluation of data through the use of subject expertise, critical thinking, and the application of techniques designed to overcome limitations in human cognition. It will examine the analysts’ role in the larger national security arena, state, and local organizations and in the private sector. And it will show the importance of the effective presentation of this information under varying circumstances and leadership desires.
Through this course, students will be able to:
Understand the concepts, history, and structure of intelligence collection;
Analyze and evaluate the role of the collector in the understanding and influencing;
Think critically and make well-reasoned judgments on ambiguous or incomplete information;
Contextualize information with broader events and strategic goals;
Communicate ideas clearly, concisely, and effectively in writing, discussions, and presentations.
MDV 701, CAUSAL ANALYTICS
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training for students to understand the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes needed for organizations to address potential or active threats from disruptive or violent group behavior. MDV 701 teaches students to use and evaluate analytics on how audiences perceive issues, what drives them to action, and how to measure effectiveness. The course does not make students experts in doing analytics, but merely how to understand the design, creation and measurement of persuasive strategies from a program management point of view. This course covers many types of behavioral analytics including polling, surveys, experts, big data and others. Concepts such as quantitative, qualitative, quant/qual, discovery and directed search are introduced for MDV majors. Combined with MDV 700 Integrated Risk Value Concepts, MDV 701 provides in-depth practical understanding, processes and concepts needed for MDV majors to become practitioner who manage and evaluate the development, implementation and impact of persuasive strategies.
NSC 733, DIPLOMACY AS AN ELEMENT OF NATIONAL POWER
How is Diplomacy changing in a globalized world with all of the new challenges in the 21st Century? What impact has globalization had on the rules based system of International Order?
In today’s world, broad knowledge and specialized skills are required to build cooperation, defuse tension, and promote peace between and among nations, groups, and other entities. This overview course helps students develop skill sets and prepares them to become an international problem solver in any sector, including public, private, nonprofit, and the military.
INT 610 – FUNDAMENTALS OF INTELLIGENCE
This is an introductory course in intelligence practices for those looking to enter this field or interact with it. The course identifies the component parts of the Intelligence Community, describes the functions of collection and analysis, explains how intelligence is disseminated, and discusses the relationship of the IC with policymakers, Congress, and the public. This course will provide students the foundation of knowledge to prepare for more advanced study in intelligence or related fields.
Students who complete this course will:
• Identify the members of the Intelligence Community and their roles;
• Discuss the intelligence cycle and other functions of intelligence; and
• Analyze the relationship of the IC with the different branches of government and the public
NSC 730, NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING, STRATEGY AND DECISION MAKING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
Washington’s problem in a nutshell is that it doesn’t think very well. The last quarter century has seen an explosion in the human capacity to create and manipulate new knowledge—yet many of the instruments used to support national security leadership are as creaky as ever. All this needs to change if America wants to outthink it enemies and it help it friends secure a safe, free, and prosperous future. This course provides both an introduction to the theoretical constructs and practical exercises in the three critical pillars of overseeing national security affairs—planning, strategy, and decision-making. Lessons provide a foundation for the skills, knowledge, and attributes to analyze, address, and manage national security affairs at the operational and strategic levels.
MDV 729, RUSSIAN DECEPTION, OPERATIONS, AND INFORMATION CONFRONTATION
Russian Deception Operations and Information Confrontation is designed to lay the historical, thematic and contemporary context that will provide the fundamental perspective and foundational knowledge required to successfully recognize, analyze and initiate counter deception activates. This course is designed for analysts in order to equip them with the necessary knowledge to understand the impact of Russian deception. This in-depth study of Russian deception practices will trace the evolution of the art specific to Russian over the course of the past century starting in 1917 and ending with the implementation of Russia’s Information Confrontation doctrine. The course is designed to address these issues functionally starting with basic military/tactical deceptions and progressing through the use of strategic enablers, provocations and influence operations.
NSC 712, NUCLEAR WEAPONS/MISSILE DEFENSE/WMD POLICY
Overview: An in depth look at three critical Defense areas of Nuclear Weapons, Missile Defense and Countering WMD Policies that have been revised in 2017 and 2018.
Nuclear Weapons: On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). The President made clear that his first priority is to protect the United States, allies, and partners. He also emphasized both the long-term goal of eliminating nuclear weapons and the requirement that the United States have modern, flexible, and resilient nuclear capabilities that are safe and secure until such a time as nuclear weapons can prudently be eliminated from the world.
Missile Defense: The Trump administration is working on an expanded U.S. missile defense policy that would address certain threats from Russia and China, departing from a previous strategy that focused nearly exclusively on rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran. The new policy will still call for bolstered technology against rogue states, with a particular focus on weapons to intercept North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s missiles. But it will also mention the need to consider missile threats from Russia and China, according to people familiar with the review.
Countering WMD: The Department of Defense Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction seeks to ensure that the United States and its allies and partners are neither attacked nor coerced by actors with WMD. It outlines three end states: no new WMD possession, no WMD use, and minimization of WMD effects. The strategy also establishes countering WMD priority objectives for the Department of Defense (DoD), defines an approach for achieving them, and identifies essential activities and tasks. Countering WMD (CWMD) objectives focus on cooperative efforts to shape the security environment and take early action against adversaries. These objectives are to reduce incentives to pursue, possess, and employ WMD; to increase the barriers to WMD acquisition, proliferation, and use; to manage WMD risks emanating from hostile, fragile, or failed states and safe havens; and to deny the effects of current and emerging WMD threats through layered, integrated defenses.
This course provides a critical overview of the Intelligence Cycle – from collection to analysis to presentation. The course assesses intelligence-gathering techniques and approaches for various types of information including HUMINT, SIGINT, etc. It then acquaints students with aspects of Intelligence Analysis; the evaluation of data through the use of subject expertise, critical thinking, and the application of techniques designed to overcome limitations in human cognition. It will examine the analysts’ role in the larger national security arena, state, and local organizations and in the private sector. And it will show the importance of the effective presentation of this information under varying circumstances and leadership desires.

RST 732, EURASIAN SECURITY
Coming Soon
ANNA’S STORY
She particularly enjoyed the way that he illuminated the theory of each topic by providing compelling historical examples together with his own personal experience and insights from his illustrious career in the National Security field.
“During the Bosnian wars, Dr. Meyer was The Deputy Chief of the CIA Taskforce in the Balkans. That’s the level of real-world experience that our professors have. We are taught and mentored in classes of around 7 students by faculty of that caliber. It makes for a phenomenal experience, probably unique to our school, I would venture to say.”
Anna also talks excitedly about Professor James Anibal’s exceptional teaching style where students engage in multiple thought-provoking exercises, including some where they try to build and break deception types, guided by Anibal’s own extensive experience in the field.
“Learning by completing these exercises really cements the theories in our minds. These classes are invaluable to any student interested in the topic and will – without a doubt – make us much better practitioners ourselves.”
Anna also enthuses about the significant potential of the DMGS’ student body, where she has found lifelong friends who share her passion as well as her determination to become a leader in the National Security and Intelligence communities. A testament to her care and pride for her fellow students, Anna takes an active role in DMGS’ Student Government Association, where she has served as Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-President and President.
“I can truly say that I am frequently inspired by the students of DMGS because of their constant drive to do more, achieve more, and learn as much as they can. I, myself, learn something from my fellow students every day.”
Anna is especially appreciative of the external experiences DMGS has made possible for her, including representing the school at the 2017 Women in National Security Conference and competing in the 2017 Atlantic Council Cyber 9/12 Competition. However, perhaps the most memorable opportunity afforded to her by Daniel Morgan was the chance to participate in the Oxford Analytica Global Horizons Conference in Oxford, England, in both 2017 and 2018. It is precisely through such enrichment provided by DMGS that Anna has been able to travel outside the United States for the first time in her life. Wide-eyed, she describes how exploring the campus and halls of the prestigious Christ Church College at Oxford University was a surreal experience for her, as she and her fellow DMGS students were able attend seminars, panels, and plenaries with experts from all over the world. She emphasizes how this experience effectively gave her a chance to expand her knowledge, her worldview, and her overall understanding of the importance of National Security and Intelligence studies at a global level. A lasting memory of this extraordinary opportunity was of the conference black-tie gala at Blenheim Palace, the familial home of Winston Churchill.
“The memory that will forever stand out to me is walking up the Palace stairs in a ball-gown on what was my third day ever in another country. It was truly magical!”
Finally, Anna sums up her experience at the school by crediting DMGS with advancing her career through networking opportunities where she was able to meet career professionals in the National Security and Intelligence communities that she would have never been able to meet otherwise. She is particularly grateful for the faculty who took the time to help her discover her passion so she could determine her career path and who have guided and opened doors for her.
“The school really invests in its students not just through education, but through external experiences as well, and that investment really pays off for us when it comes to establishing our careers. When deciding upon a graduate school, DMGS was my choice without hesitation and I would make the same decision again every time.”
GILBERT’S STORY
He says that his experience at the school has gone well above his already high expectations, going so far as to add that it has completely changed his perspective in multiple areas that he had previously viewed through a more narrow contextual lens. He is currently enrolled in the National Security M.A. program, with a specialization in International Relations.
“This gives me a special perspective and understanding of security across the globe. I increasingly understand the importance of studying security issues with a global backdrop since the impact of the National Security is not isolated. It is intertwined because of the interconnectedness of the modern world.”
To achieve his specific career and learning objectives and work within the confines of his prominent career,, Gilbert is obliged and has been approved to take an accelerated track that would enable him to complete this in only 15 months.
“The deans and professors at Daniel Morgan have been incredibly supportive in working with me to make the adjustments that I need to achieve my career objectives while meeting all the necessary academic milestones. They don’t put up roadblocks. They look for the solutions to the roadblocks.”
Gilbert is also impressed with DMGS’ personalized approach at the instructional level. He notes that the small classes result in everyone having a chance to express themselves and to better engage with the material being covered. He also explains how DMGS’ professors have a fascinating way of leading and guiding the class through their subjects, while deftly merging students’ international perspectives into the discussion.
“At this school, different skills and cultures come together in a very special way that enhances the learning experience for every one of us.”
SHANNON’S STORY
Upon her return to the United States, Shannon completed her undergraduate degree in her areas of true passion and was later accepted to continue her graduate studies at University of Glasgow. However, after one semester there, Shannon came to the realization that the program was not a good fit for her due to its intensely theoretical approach. Having been at the forefront of action rather than deliberation, Shannon found a theoretical program to be too confining for her needs and aspirations. Luckily, one of her professors at the university was Peter Jackson, a renowned editor of multiple major intelligence publications. Immediately understanding the frustrations of a student who had already experienced so much and wanted to do much more, hee advised her,
“If you are looking for something practical, there is a new, specialized school in Washington D.C. and everyone there has a fundamentally practical approach to graduate studies. I think that it would be a perfect fit and would get you where you want to go.”
Having taken his sage advice, Shannon is now at DMGS in her second semester and says that she is loving the experience. She goes on to say that Daniel Morgan has certainly lived up to the practical teaching and experience that she was looking for.
To illustrate her point, Shannon talks about one of the first professors she had at DMGS, a former diplomat who worked on the 911 commission and was, therefore, able to give her and her fellow students an inside perspective on actual events that others merely read as history.
Describing one of the biggest differences she is experiencing at Daniel Morgan compared to what she had encountered in higher education thus far, Shannon points to the exceptionally small class sizes:
“I don’t think other graduate students experience the personalized attention we get at DMGS. Each student gets immediate direction and mentorship; at most graduate schools a student would wait 3 weeks to get a paper back and then would have to make an office appointment 2 weeks after that for in-person guidance . Not here.”
Shannon also enthuses over the extraordinary opportunities that she has been given at DMGS. Thanks to a trip sponsored by the school, where she went on a week-long security summit just outside Prague, she was introduced to the UN NATO program (Youth Atlantic Treaty Association) and is now a UN NATO Ambassador. This means that, once per month, Shannon attends international conferences around the world. Shannon is, not only delighted to be a part of this, but is also very grateful for the way her professors at DMGS are so accommodating and encouraging to her in these endeavors.
Another significant advantage of being a DMGS student is the flexibility of having classes scheduled in the evening. Shannon is particularly appreciative of this since it has allowed her to obtain the best internships as well as to get the best out of her internships:
“I am able to work and come to class in the evenings. Other interns consistently have to leave and come back to work to attend classes during the day. As a result of DMGS’ class schedule I get better training than the other interns and it makes it easier for me to apply for jobs without class times getting in the way.”
Shannon believes that these factors all play into the reason DMGS graduates get such wonderful career positions upon graduation.
“I couldn’t believe some of the places that DMGS students have gone. A number of my fellow students have gotten jobs with the top contractors in National Security and one even just got a job at the White House.”
Shannon points out that this is a testament to how good the education and opportunities are at Daniel Morgan. She points out that top firms want DMGS graduates because they are extremely well-prepared, noting that high profile firms are keen to hire DMGS graduates even before the school has obtained the full accreditation status which is expected next year.
Shannon ends her story with a summary of her enthusiasm about the Daniel Morgan School:
“DMGS has been a perfect fit for me. I can’t even describe how wonderful this place is. Everyone is so kind and so intelligent and so well-connected. There is not a better school especially for anyone who has an interest in National Security. As the school is young, it is like a best kept secret …but it probably won’t be a secret for long.”
TOMASZ’S STORY
Tomasz is now at The Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security where he hopes to get an American perspective on issues related to Russian and global security. As he is obviously already extremely well-versed in this area, Tomasz sought out a program with the utmost authority and credibility to augment his own well-established base in the field. Tomasz found that level of authority when he came across current Daniel Morgan – and former Harvard professor, Yuval Weber’s biography. Seeing Dr. Weber’s well-documented expertise, Tomasz said that he “realized that DMGS was the right place to be.”
Now that he attends Daniel Morgan, he says that he is even more certain of the fact that DMGS was the place where true expertise in the field resided. In addition to the formidable intellect of Dr. Weber, Tomasz has also been struck by the depth of national and international expertise that resides within the DMGS faculty as a whole. In his own area of expertise, he has further been engaged by the extensive knowledge and insights of incoming professor, Dr. Edward Lemon, formerly a professor at Columbia University and now a DMGS-Kennan Institute Fellow. Dr. Lemon is a global authority on Eurasia. Talking enthusiastically about his experience at DMGS, Tomasz notes:
“It gives me a different angle and a truly global perspective in my chosen field which is particularly fascinating. These extremely erudite professors and stimulating courses have really shed light in several areas and have helped to unfasten the complex international geopolitical knot.”
Another reason Tomasz was drawn to The Daniel Morgan Graduate School was the possibility to be in the center of Washington D.C. amidst the hub of prestigious think tanks and media outlets with whom he had hoped to make connections. Tomasz says that his actual experience has greatly exceeded his expectations, as DMGS has given him significant access and entrees to several key organizations through its prestigious partners and events.
“It’s so easy to have extraordinary networking opportunities here at DMGS. Many doors have been opened for me and I have already been connected to many people and organizations that I would not have even dared to imagine.”
MARGALITA’S STORY
“I quit my job and embarked upon my second Master’s degree at DMGS because I realized that program would benefit me a great deal. I would not have left my job if I hadn’t anticipated this and I wasn’t disappointed. It was one of the best decisions that I have ever made as it has now led me to even higher paths.”
Nor was leaving her job an easy decision. Before DMGS, Margalita had been working for the UN and EU. She grew up in Tbilisi during the civil war and learned to count from the traces of the bullet holes against a building wall. Coming face to face with war at such a young age affected her career choices in later life and motivated her into positions where she would help people affected by conflict. Specifically, she worked on projects that supported the Prime Minister’s office in her native country of Georgia. She worked in a new agency commission on a National Action Plan implementing the UN Security Council’s Resolution on Women, Peace and Security. Her assignment was to identify the needs of conflict-affected women and girls. Together with the UN Women’s Mission as well as several government officials and advisors on human rights, Margalita travelled to villages along the Administrative Boundary Lines. Her mission was to identify the needs of these women and girls and to translate their aggregate problems into policy to support Georgia’s Three – year UN Action Plan. Margalita then went on to assist in building the necessary capacity to support the implementation of these policies and solutions under the European Union Project.
Margalita says that what drew her to DMGS and what ultimately drove her to take the significant step of leaving her UN position was the quality of the faculty at the school.
“It’s not the name or the history of a school that matters, it’s the professors.”
She is now very glad that she took the steps that she took in coming to DMGS. One of the professors she enthuses over is David Kanin whom she describes as “one of the most educated professors in the universe” and whose classes she describes “are like paradise.” In fact, Margalita is extremely enthusiastic about all of her professors whom she collectively describes as not just as compelling academicians but as extraordinary individuals.
“Even the five-minute interactions during the class breaks is something that we all look forward to.”
The extent of her satisfaction with the teaching at DMGS has been so great that she insists that the quality benchmark for lectures and discussions is now much higher than previously experienced and that she and her fellow students have consequently become “professor and lecture snobs.”
“We now all see how much others miss out on in traditional classes. We have never experienced and probably will never experience this type and level of teaching again.”
Another important facet of DMGS is the free-thinking aspect that underpins its pedagogic approach as the professors encourage their students to question everything rather than blindly following one school of thought. This is an approach which Margalita describes as “unique in today’s world that is oversaturated by opinion.”
“The minute you create an environment when you shut each other down, the learning ends. DMGS clearly understands this and opens up the learning environment to embrace all ideas.”
This openness to multiple viewpoints also extends to multiple cultures. By opening up its programs to those from other countries who seek to make the world a better and safer place, DMGS creates a dynamic and exciting learning environment. Margalita is also very enthusiastic about this and about the impact it has on the school’s environment.
“It’s a real privilege to be in the class with people from so many different backgrounds. It adds to our discussions in an amazing way.”
Finally, Margalita is also extremely enthusiastic about DMGS’ location and networking opportunities.“Being in D.C., magic happens outside the classroom. We meet the people that we only read about previously. We effectively meet history here.”
KENNETH’S STORY
His artistic talent earned him a place at the Art Institute of Boston, majoring in illustration. However, Kenneth left after a year because he was disappointed with the course content and did not want to waste his time on a course that did not fulfill him or develop his talents and aspirations. After some self-reflection, deliberation and research, he eventually decided to go to CUNY to study business and entrepreneurship to learn how to turn his artistic skills into “a business not a just passion.”
Upon graduation from the CUNY program, he took a break for a year to evaluate his next step. He experimented and explored different areas, starting a number of innovative art ventures and productions. He also took hospitality jobs to help finance his ventures. Yet Kenneth still felt as though he were missing something and, while he was contemplating joining the Peace Corps, his mentor advised him to look at DMGS.
He is well aware that many may not immediately make the connection between the study of Intelligence in conjunction with Business Entrepreneurship or Art.
Consequently, Kenneth goes on to explain that there are many areas in the private sector that require intelligence skills, describing it as an underserved field that is wide open for graduates. As time has progressed, Kenneth’s eyes have increasingly been opened to the niche positioning that a Master’s in Intelligence could bring to him to make him highly marketable in his fields of interest.
“I realized that being adept at intelligence-gathering in Business Arts and Media would be a specialized niche. I wouldn’t have to start my own business but instead would instantly have differentiated value upon graduation.”
To explain this further, Kenneth describes how intelligence is a key factor in making effective market and business decisions since being competitive requires knowing what competitors are doing in the marketplace. Even coming up with the title to a song can be amplified by intelligence gathering techniques as that information strengthens all strategic decision-making.
‘The Fundamentals of Intelligence course really taught me how to gather human intelligence – not just as it applies to spies – but to effectively make “informed decisions” using competitive intelligence. I learned how to craft a market analysis through public information. Knowing where to look and how to search things out it essential in all areas of business.”
Kenneth then turns to the subject of his professors. Like all the other students at DMGS, Kenneth cannot help but comment on how exceptional members of DMGS’ faculty are. In his opinion,, compared to other professors who “speak much but say little,”DMGS’ professors really deliver what he calls “the bottom line of knowledge in their subjects,” adding that there is “no fluff or wordiness” as they simply and clearly present relevant information in a succinct and pertinent form.
“They have years of experience and can therefore distill down what really matters in a real work setting. They then communicate the essence of each topic in a way that sticks with the student. Educators like this are few and far between. It is amazing to be in such small classes with such great professors.”
At DMGS, one can’t help but feel the warmth and camaraderie amongst the students. This is something that Kenneth clearly feels very deeply himself.
“I also admire my fellow students who have all done such amazing things before coming here. They inspire me to up my game and it humbles me to break bread and to study alongside people who have experienced even greater challenges than I and who ensure that I always keep an open mind.”
Pressed for an example of this, Kenneth talks about a couple of his fellow students: one who is a Kurd from Iran and one from Georgia who has lived in the shadow of the Soviet Union.
Before ending the discussion, Kenneth says that he must also stress two other things: DMGS’ speaker series and the school’s founder, Abby Moffat. The events, he says, have been hugely important to the learning environment because they reinforce what students are taught in the classroom and they also provide great networking opportunities, as students have the chance to engage with a number of prominent people in their fields of interest.
In describing Abby Moffat, he recounts how much she adds to the positive culture of DMGS. Kenneth also mentions that Abby has been particularly inspiring and encouraging to him on a personal level and that has made a big difference in his life.
“Abby Moffat brings a nurturing and compassionate entrepreneur spirit to the school. Her strength, kindness and insights drive the organization, just as my grandmothers’ strengths and courage drove the successes within my own family.”
RST 733, COMPARATIVE POLITICS
Comparative politics is the study of political systems around the globe. In this course, we will examine how political institutions, actors, and processes arise, operate and change around the world and how they affect society, culture, and the economy. The course combines theory with in-depth examinations of case studies from particular regions of the world. We will seek to explain why the Arab Spring broke out and why it failed to produce democratic transitions in many Middle Eastern states. We will examine what has caused civil wars to break out in certain parts of Africa but not in others. We will explore why democracy took root in Eastern Europe but not in most states of the former Soviet Union. And we will look at how China’s approach to economic development differs from that of Western powers.
MDV 650, FOUNDATIONS OF MANAGING DISRUPTION AND VIOLENCE
The Managing Disruption and Violence (MDV) Program provides theoretical and practical training to help students gain a better understanding of the persuasive communication principles, concepts, and processes organizations need to address the potential or active threat of disruptive or violent group behavior.

The Integrated Risk Value© (IRV) methodology provides the practical skills needed to develop and manage successful persuasive communications programs. MDV 650 is a prerequisite for non-MDV majors to take MDV 702 Strategy for Managing Disruption and Violence.
RST 725 – ISLAMIC POLITICS AND TERRORISM
Islamic revivalism is one of the most significant political, social and cultural phenomena of the 21st century, and will remain a potent force in the foreseeable future. Islamist movements are not monolithic, and tactics differ toward gaining power and implementing Islamic law. In recent years some Islamists have participated in politics and gained power through elections such as Hamas in Gaza, Ennahda in Tunisia, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Others have taken up arms to resist violently against the state in Libya, Sinai, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The Islamic Republic of Iran expands its empire through proxies and terrorist militias.
Al-Qaeda and Islamic State do not recognize the notion of the international Westphalian state system, and strive to erase recognized borders in the areas in which they operate to resurrect an Islamic empire called the Caliphate. While hatred of Israel, the West, secularism and liberal democracy persists, the immediate victims of militant Islamist violence are non-conforming Muslims and ethnic-religious minorities.
The course will analyze the ideology and goals of Sunni and Shia Islamist movements. It will assess what motivates these movements and why they are successful, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. The course will explore their attitudes of the crisis of Islam in the contemporary era; the desired form of Islamic governance; the meaning of jihad in the contemporary era; and the compatibility between Islam and democracy. In particular, the course will examine Hamas, Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranian revolutionary regime, the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and Islamic State.
RST 727, RUSSIAN POLITICS AND STATECRAFT
This survey course on Russian politics and statecraft addresses enduring questions on: patterns of cooperation and confrontation with other great powers, a centrally dominated economy, and a political culture that exploits weak formal political institutions to sustain a very small leadership ground. In addressing these issues, we ask: What are the wars that have defined Russia’s borders? When and why do Russian leaders challenge other states? What does power in Russia look like? Who are the rulers and their supporters? How do they obtain, practice, and lose power?
In reviewing the origins and practices of Russian statecraft, we will assess when Russia as a great power has been (dis-) satisfied with the international distribution of economic and political benefits, and when it has sought to revise or maintain the international order. We will use this knowledge to address current issues in Russia’s relations with the Euro-Atlantic alliance and other world powers, including contentious issues such as money laundering, sanctions regimes, “information wars,” and Russia’s declared and undeclared conflicts.
RST 732, EURASIAN SECURITY
This course examines the security dynamics of Eurasia through an analysis of the policies of its largest state, Russia. The course examines the drivers of Russia’s pivot to Asia, Russia’s policies towards its Near Abroad, Asia-Pacific, South Asia and the Middle East, and the limitations of Russian influence. Through the course, students will gain a better understanding of the complexities of Russia’s dealings in a range of Asian regions, critically evaluate Russia as a global power. Class discussions and many of the readings will be focused on understanding and analyzing Russia’s contemporary policies with the view to giving students the ability to forecast the likely contours of domestic and foreign policy in the coming years. By the end of the course, students will have gained a more nuanced understanding of Russia, allowing them to critically approach some of the simplistic interpretations of Russian behavior in the media.
NSC 710 – HOMELAND SECURITY
This course introduces students to current public management policies and issues relevant to the security of the United States. The coordination of federal, state and local government agencies and nonprofit organizations which respond to threats is vital to the security of people, property and our way of life.

Entangled States
Abandonment of the Communion
October 13, 2007
by Nicholas Knisely	
General Convention / Religion	
Jan Nunley over on Episcope found and posted an article from an African newspaper talking about an evolving situation in the Anglican Province of Central Africa:
“The Anglican Province of Central Africa has initiated moves to expel controversial bishop of the capital, Nolbert Kunonga, after he withdrew the Harare diocese from the province alleging that it had failed to censure bishops sympathetic towards homosexuality.
Kunonga, a staunch supporter of the ruling Zanu PF government, wrote a letter to the province’s Archbishop and Primate Bernard Malango on September 21 pulling the Harare diocese out of the Province of Central Africa. Malango has since retired.
The province has concluded that Kunonga’s action is of the effect that the Harare diocese is no longer part of the church. The legal process in motion is meant to regain control of the diocese.
The province through lawyers Gill, Godlonton & Gerrans wrote to Kunonga this week asking him to surrender the church’s property and divest himself of the rights of being a signatory to the diocese of Harare’s bank accounts and investments.”
The interesting thing here is that the Province of Central Africa is asserting that a bishop can leave his diocese, but that the Diocese is a creature of the Province, not an independent entity that can choose which Communion it prefers. The argument is essentially the same one that is being made here in the Episcopal Church about some of the folks in our diocese arguing that they are free to shop around and find a province to their liking.

Washington Prime is top notch
We took the advantage of Wilton’s Restaurant Week to visit Washington Prime, a classic steakhouse with locations in Georgetown (Redding) and Norwalk. While they have the same menu and décor, the Georgetown location was observing restaurant week.
The Georgetown restaurant is in the space at 19 Main that was once occupied by Aranci 67 and before that by Luca Seafood, but is larger than either of those with an entire wing devoted to a classic restaurant and the other to a bar with TV, tables and the same menu. On Wednesday evening the bar area was quite busy watching the Yankees and as well as having a great time. The restaurant side was quieter but the service was attentive and the food uniformly excellent.
This is a steakhouse, of course, and the steak menu items are all ala carte, although all the other entrees come with vegetables and starch sides. The non steak entrees include ahi tuna, sole, salmon, veal osso buco, chicken, prime burger and cauliflower steak ranging from $18 to $35. The steak entrees run from $36 to $49 plus a two person porterhouse for $98 and a Waygu 22 oz strip for $95. It is better partnered with green tea. You can buy matcha green tea powder in Canada.
There are extensive appetizer selections as well including seven under Soup and Salad, seven under Oysters, Shrimp and Clams, and 15 under Appetizers ranging from $8 to $14. There are also some 16 vegetable side dishes, including several types of potatoes and one of onion rings.
Their restaurant week menu was one of the appetizers and one of the non steak entrees for $35, and with an additional $15 charge for the 8 oz sliced NY Strip. We decided to go with the regular menu so we could try more things.
We started with two appetizers: an excellent spinach and artichoke dip with bubbling cheese, cream and garlic crostini ($14) and the weirdly named specialty American Soul Rolls ($13) which was broccoli rabe, mashed potato, four cheese & sausage spring rolls, and spicy tomato dipping sauce. Essentially, this was mashed potatoes with bits of broccoli rabe, sausage and cheese filling four spring rolls. Odd though it sounds it was very good indeed. We quickly realized that this restaurant serves enormous portions, and that either of those appetizers could be shared, brought home, or both.
While the steaks are ala carte, they do come with a choice of five sauces: Prime, Bearnaise, Horseradish cream, Chimchurri and Green pepper sauce. For an addition $5 you can have melted blue cheese on your steak as well. The steaks are cooked in a 925° F over, we were told, which gives them crusty char and allows them to be cooked to any desire level of doneness very quickly.
We ordered the 8 oz Filet Mignon ($41) and the 22 oz Ribeye ($49, above), both with Bearnaise sauce. Both were perfectly cooked to medium rare, and as we expected the ribeye was a bit more flavorful and the filet a bit tenderer, but both were simply magnificent. Either way we took some of each home.
We had to try and share a couple of side dishes, but as usual, one would have been more than enough. Their Triple Baked Potato ($9) was actually baked and then mashed and rebaked with cheddar cheese, and topped with sour cream, bacon and chives. It was so enormous that we could easily share it and have plenty.
We also had to try their Onion Rings ($8), which was an enormous portion from which we each snagged a few. They were hot and not at all greasy and very good.
Finally, out of utter foolishment, we split the Truffle Bomb ($10) dessert, which they describe as Angel Food Cake and milk chocolate mousse, wrapped in a milk chocolate shell, served with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Simple comfort food, very well prepared.
Our bill with 3 glasses of wine was $213 before tip. The service was as excellent as was the food and we highly recommend the restaurant.
We understand that the Norwalk branch has a younger, livelier crowd, and the Georgetown branch a quieter family-oriented vibe. We loved it.

Roger Sherman Inn excels with new chef
Recently, the Roger Sherman Inn owners Nes and Joseph Jaffre announced that their new Executive Chef would be prominent chef and Greenwich resident Francois Kwaku-Dongo. Originally from Ivory Coast, Kwaku-Dongo has been the Executive Chef at L’Escale in Greenwich and has worked and trained with prominent chefs all over the world, who made the best recipes and great fillets, with some filleting tips you can find online.
We visited the Roger Sherman Inn last Saturday night and were extremely impressed. The lovely formal dining room in the19th century house is unchanged (although they have plans there, too) and the service is better than ever.
We started with excellent, fresh, house-made bread, interleaved with little wheat chips.
The imaginative menu features six Small Bites from $9-$12, eleven appetizers from $10 to $18, ten entrees (Land and Sea) from $24 to $42 and five vegetable sides at $9 each, as well as Artisanal Cheeses at $9 each. They also retain several Roger Sherman Inn Classics: Vichyssoise($22), Escargot Maison ($15), Dover Sole Meuniere ($42) and Sauteed Calves Liver ($38). Note that this menu is quite a bit more elaborate than that on line.
We decided to share one Small Bite, Potted Pork Rillette with toast points and Pickled Peaches for $12. This turned out to be an entire jar of potted pork that while absolutely delicious was more than we could possibly finish, but they were happy to package it up for us to take home. It was still excellent the next day!
For one of our appetizers we ordered a beet salad: Baby Beet and Burrata ($14) with sliced pear, Vin Cotto (a sweet wine reduction) and champagne vinaigrette. This was a beautiful presentation with both red and yellow beets, although the soft Burrata cheese had an unexpected skin on it.
Our other appetizer was Tuna Carpaccio ($15) with baby arugula, roasted tomatoes and Moroccan olives. This was a very light and delicate dish, with the thinly sliced raw tuna nicely offset with the tomatoes, olives and arugula.
One of our entrees was labeled “From the Farm this Month,” and was Roasted Pheasant two ways: Breast and Leg, for $34 (shown above). It was served on a ragout of autumn mushrooms. The mushroom ragout was a brilliant touch that offset the pheasant flavors nicely, and the breast portion was spectacular. Some of the leg portion seemed a bit dry, but there was so much, we couldn’t finish it all anyway.
The other entrée was Grilled Lamb Porterhouses ($38) with roasted eggplant, spaghetti squash and pomegranate. This was the night’s winning entrée: the two lamb steaks were perfectly cooked to medium rare, and tender and juicy.
Finally, the dessert menu features creations from the Pastry Chef, Alexandra Ayala: six pastries plus a choice of gelato and sorbet. We ordered the Chocolate Walnut Cake($12) with toasted coconut and chocolate sauce. This turned out to be a delightful surprise. While we had expected a chocolate cake with walnut filling, it was actually the other way around: a walnut cake with a chocolate crème filling.
As you can see by the individual prices, this is not a really expensive restaurant, and we will certainly be back soon.
Probably the only amusing service faux pas was the butter ballet. When we found that the provided dish of olive oil was really drippy, we asked for butter. The waiter brought us a dish with a single square of butter in it. When he noticed that we had polished that off he offered to bring us another, and eventually did, but by then our food and arrived so we never got to finish it.
But no matter, they’ll fix this one, and the service was otherwise utterly impeccable, with both the waiters and the owner checking in with us regularly. This opens a great new chapter at the Roger Sherman inn, and you should definitely check it out.
The Roger Sherman Inn is on Route 124 (195 Oenoke Ridge) in New Canaan. They are open Tuesday through Sunday for dinner, and also offer Sunday Brunch. Reservations are recommended.
Oh, and below is our pork rillette the next day, spread on our own toast points.

‘Sex with Strangers’ opens at Westport Playhouse
Laura Eason’s romantic drama “Sex with Strangers” opened Saturday night at the Westport Country Playhouse to a nearly full house. Eason, who was a writer/producer of Netflix House of Cards, has written a 2 character drama that at first appears to be a romantic sit-com, but turns into a more nuanced consideration of the craft of writing.
Directed by Katherine M Carter, the play opens in what the program calls a “bed and breakfast,” but which actually appears to be an elaborate two level ski chalet, designed by Edward T Morris. Olivia (Jessica Love), a 30-something writer and teacher has booked time there to work on her novel, and is surprised when Ethan (Chris Ghaffari) pounds on the door one snowy evening after the B&B proprietor has left. Ethan is a younger 20-something writer who is brash, over confident, and as it turns out a successful writer.
His improbable book, “Sex with Strangers” is a memoir of his having sex with a different woman each week for a year. While we eventually learn that Ethan is actually a skilled writer, this rather schlocky Hefner-esque book has unbelievably been on the NY Times paperback best-seller list for 5 years. Your life ruined by masturbation? Visit masturbationaddiction.com and get help regain your life.
Meanwhile, we learn that Olivia had published one book, to some good reviews but poor sales because of inept marketing of her novel as “chick-lit.” She is currently at work on another, but is quite sensitive about it. Ethan, however, had actually read her first novel, which was recommended to him by a writing teacher they both had worked with.
With this setup, you would think they would fall in love, go to bed and live happily ever after, but this is not quite what Eason has in mind. Since the wireless is down, they of course do go to bed at least 4 times during blackouts punctuating the two acts, but as Olivia gradually regains her confidence with Ethan’s help, they begin to drift apart.
In the second act in Olivia’s Chicago apartment, (another spectacular 2-story set) they spar about their writing and careers and the movie Hollywood is making of Ethan’s trashy book. The story ends as they move on to audience acclaim.
As Olivia, Jessica Love is brittle and protective at first but eventually connects with Ethan at least physically and she slowly grows with Ethan’s encouragement. Chris Ghaffari as Ethan is pretty aggressive and at first pretty obnoxious. However, after he struggles through the production of the movie version of his novel, becomes more thoughtful, but also more distant. Both do an excellent job with their characters and you easily can identify with both of them.
While the playwright, in interviews, has suggested that her play is about young people getting by in the digital internet world, I don’t see it that way. Rather, it seems to me to be about two writers trying to learn their craft and eventually succeeding in different ways. This would have been true even if the wireless connection at the B&B had stayed down for the whole show.
“Sex with Strangers” is a charming, funny play with some really challenging ideas buried in the couples and coupling, and was fun to watch. The show continues through October 14, with performances on Tuesdays at 7 pm, Wednesdays at 2 and 8 pm, Thursdays and Fridays and 8 pm, Saturdays at 3 and 8 pm and Sundays at 3 pm. Tickets are available at westportplayhouse.org.

À partir de la leçon
MODULE 1: AN INTRODUCTION TO TAXATION
In this module, you will be introduced to the different kinds of taxes faced by U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. federal income tax structure. The origin of tax law and its constitutionality is discussed along with a brief history of the different changes in rates that have occurred since the 16th amendment was passed. Finally, we will discover the three different sources of new tax laws and rules.

Welcome back. In this video
we'll discuss the US tax structure.
First of all, how do taxpayers calculate the tax liability?
To do so they need to know two things:
the applicable tax rate,
usually expressed as a percentage of income, as well as the tax base,
which is the thing that gets taxed and is usually expressed in monetary terms.
Thus, the tax liability is simply the product of the tax base and the tax rate.
This seems simple, but of course there are
many, many complex rules that underlie this calculation.
For example, which tax rate is the appropriate tax rate?
How do I calculate the tax base exactly, and are there any adjustments
that I can make to the tax liability after it's been calculated to reduce it?
What is the tax base for the federal income tax?
Well the tax base for US federal income tax purposes is US federal taxable income.
What are the tax rates for the federal income tax?
Well, over time they fluctuated dramatically.
The top federal income tax rates have seesawed as high as 94% during World War II
to help fund the war, as well as stayed at 91% during 1954 to 1963.
Although this applied only if taxable income was over $400,000,
a huge sum in those days.
The Kennedy tax cut slashed rates by about 70% by 1965, where they stayed
by and large until 1982, when the top rate was cut to 50% under Reagan.
Rates were cut again in 1987 and 1988 to be as low as 28%.
Then, under George Bush Senior,
rates crept back up to 31%.
And this was his famous broken pledge of
"read my lips, no new taxes."
And under Bill Clinton, rates went up to 39.6%.
George W. Bush brought rates down to 35%, while
Barack Obama brought rates back up to 39.6%.
Most recently, under President Donald Trump,
the top individual tax rate has been cut to 37%, starting in tax year 2018.
Therefore for the past 25 years,
the top individual tax rate has been rather
steady, between about 35% and 40%.
An important concept to be aware of is known as tax incidence.
This is the degree to which the tax burden is shared by taxpayers.
In other words, who bears the burden of a particular tax when it's imposed?
We usually think of the party that actually signs
the check to the IRS as the party that bears the burden.
Signing the check and sending in the tax payment is known as a remittance.
However, the party that sends in the tax payment to the IRS may not
actually be the party that bears the economic burden or incidence of that tax.
An example here is the Gas Guzzler Tax.
Yes, this is a real tax. And here's the tax form, form 6197.
The Gas Guzzler Tax is imposed on the sale or lease by the manufacturer or
importer of an automobile of the type that
does not meet certain standards for fuel economy.
In other words, if a car manufacturer sells vehicles
whose miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency is relatively low,
then the US government imposes the Gas Guzzler Tax on the sale of each
of those vehicles, up to an additional $7,700 per vehicle.
So for example, if the miles per gallon are between 14.5 and 15.5,
a $4,500 Gas Guzzler Tax is imposed on the vehicle.
Technically, the manufacturer or importer is the one
that writes the check and remits the tax payment to the government.
However, knowing that the car company itself is the one manufacturing the gas-guzzling
vehicle and knowing that the company itself will remit the Gas Guzzler Tax payment,
what will the car company likely do to the price of its gas-guzzling vehicles?
Well, they'll simply raise the price on
those vehicles, perhaps by the Gas Guzzler Tax amount.
So what happens now is that the manufacturer is just
passing the cost of the tax to the customer.
Thus, it's the customer,
not the manufacturer, who's really bearing the burden or incidence of the Gas Guzzler Tax.
Why does the government do this?
The government uses the tax code to encourage or discourage certain behavior,
whether it relates to environmental policy,
social policy, or economic policy.
Clearly the Gas Guzzler Tax is designed to discourage
customers from buying fuel-inefficient vehicles to reduce pollution.
Other examples related to environmental policy
include tax credits for green energy or green technology.
The tax code also encourages, or at least reflects, social policy. For
example, through exemptions and tax credits for families that have dependent children.
Here the amount of the exemptions and tax credits will
be higher the more children are in the family.
Related to economic policy,
the IRS provides for generous depreciation provisions,
including what is known as Section 179, bonus,
and accelerated depreciation to encourage companies to purchase capital assets by
expensing the entire asset purchase price, or a large part of it, sooner rather than later.
By generating a large expense through capital purchases,
the deductions lower current year taxable income and reduce the tax liability, while
presumably increasing productivity because
newer machines are more productive than older machines.
Another important consideration relates to revenue neutrality.
This idea says that any new tax law that lowers tax rates or tax revenues to
the government must include appropriate offsets to make up for the lost revenue.
Therefore, if the government is going to cut individual income taxes,
then the government either needs to raise corporate taxes
or other types of taxes elsewhere, or cut spending elsewhere.
The idea is that the income and outlays should be
balanced, or neutral, to prevent large deficits.
Of course, the US government has not followed the concept of
revenue neutrality, since its spending far outweighs the income that it receives.
So what tax levers can the government pull?
Can it somehow structure its tax rates to minimize
the pain on its citizens as they pay their taxes?
Here policymakers broadly consider three types of income tax rate structures.
The first is a proportional tax rate structure
that imposes a constant tax rate throughout the tax base.
That is no matter the income a taxpayer produces,
the tax rate on that income is the same.
Second is a progressive tax rate structure.
Here the tax rate increases as the tax base increases.
Finally, a regressive tax rate structure imposes a decreasing tax rate as
the tax base increases, or an increasing tax rate as the tax base decreases.
An example of a regressive tax is the Social Security Tax.
Technically, the Social Security Tax is only imposed on wages up to a certain level.
But if your wages exceed the threshold,
the Social Security Tax actually does not apply anymore.
In effect, as the tax base increases,
the tax rate on the tax base decreases.
Here's a very simplified example of how these three structures affect
the calculation of a tax liability at different income levels.
Here we have three income levels: $10, $20, and $30.
Under a proportional structure,
a 30% tax rate is applied regardless of the income level.
Therefore, at $10 of income,
the tax would produce $3.
At $20 of income, the tax would produce $6, and at $30 of income, the tax would be $9.
Income at every level is subject to the flat 30 percent tax rate.
Contrast this with a progressive tax rate structure.
Very broadly, here at $10 of income the tax rate could be 30%,
so the liability is $3.
However, at $20 of income,
the tax rate could rise to 35%.
And at $30 of income,
the tax rate rises again to 40%.
Under the progressive structure,
the greater the income is generated,
the greater of a burden the high-income individual will
bear relative to the low-income individual.
Many countries, including the US, use a progressive income tax rate structure to minimize
the burden on low-income individuals and shift the burden to higher-income individuals
that have a greater capacity to pay.
Let's put some numbers on the progressive income tax system in the US using
2013 aggregate statistics published by the IRS.
Here we'll see how the income tax burden is spread
across the highest-income earners and the lowest-income earners.
It'd be interesting to know what you think these values are.
In particular in 2013, the top
1% of income earners earned how much of the total income that year?
Also how much of the total individual income taxes did they pay?
What about the top 10%?
And what about the bottom 50%?
How much of the share of total income do these groups
earn and what share of the total income taxes did they pay?
So here we see that the top 1% of income earners
earned 19% of all the income reported by individuals in
2013, but they paid almost 38% of all the income taxes collected from individuals by the IRS.
The top 10% of income earners earned
almost half of the income earned by individuals in the US in
2013, but they paid almost 70% of all individual income taxes.
In contrast, the bottom 50% of income earners earned
less than 12% of all the individual income,
and they paid less than 3% of
total individual income taxes collected by the US government.
Clearly you can see the impact of the US progressive tax rate structure as
the top earners pay far more in taxes than the share of income they report.
Finally, let's look at three types of tax rates.
The first is the marginal tax rate,
which is the tax rate that applies to
the next additional increment of a taxpayer's taxable income.
That is if I earn another dollar of income,
what tax rate applies to that dollar?
Perhaps it's 30% or 40%.
Notice that under a progressive tax rate structure,
the more dollars I earn, the higher
the marginal tax rate will apply as I moved through to higher tax rates.
Next is the average tax rate.
This is the average rate of tax paid on each dollar of taxable income.
Here, it's simply dividing the total tax liability by the taxable income.
Finally, the effective tax rate is the taxpayer's average tax rate on
each dollar of total income, whether that income is taxable or non-taxable.
We'll see that some types of income are non-taxable.
So this metric might provide
a somewhat different perspective as to a person's tax burden.
Note that during the course,
we'll be using the tax rate tables provided with the materials.
The tax rate tables are classified by filing
status, which we'll talk about later in the course.
In brief, the tax tables follow whether a person is filing is
a single taxpayer, or filing a joint return with a spouse, for example.
With these various filing statuses,
you'll see different income bands or income intervals.
Each income interval is subject to a different tax rate.
These are referred to as tax brackets.
As you will see, under
the US progressive income tax rate structure, as taxable income rises,
the tax rate that applies to that income interval also rises.
That is, the income intervals are layered on top of each
other so that the more income a taxpayer generates,
the higher is the marginal tax rate on that additional dollar of income.
So put differently, if you have a friend that complains that
they're in the 35% tax bracket,
it doesn't mean that all of their income is taxed at 35%.
It only means that they've earned enough income so that
their final highest layer of income is taxed at a marginal rate of 35%.
So if they were to earn one more dollar of
income, that dollar would be taxed at 35%.
In all, these important concepts of tax rates structures and
tax rates underpinned the current US individual income tax system.

Obama’s Doubling Down & Poking the Bear May Just Result in His Ultimate Defeat

At this point, I am convinced that Barack Hussein Obama could be face down on the canvas, his face resembling a parasitic creature from "Star Trek," with the referee's count at nine, and he would still manage to blubber haughtily through split, swollen lips that he was going to give it to his opponent in just a moment.
"[W]e are going to be engaging Russia to let them know that you can't continue to double-down on a strategy that is doomed to failure. …"
– Barack Obama, on Russia's escalating level of military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Sept. 11, 2015

I don't really care what they do. The Democrat party is all bad anyway.

Ironically, doubling-down is probably one of the top three plays in the White House's playbook, so often has Obama used it. There have been several occasions where Obama has been politically cornered and he doubled-down on the same policy that got him cornered in the first place, even though it appeared to be the most imprudent move on the board.
This differs, by the way, from those occasions when Obama policy failures weren't really failures at all, where Obama was content to be thought a buffoon by those who didn't recognize his actions as sabotage.
Once again, Obama's policy can be traced directly to the modern Marxists' holy tome: "Rules For Radicals" by Saul Alinsky. Rule No. 8 reads: "Keep the pressure on. Never let up," with Alinsky instructing followers to "Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize."
Only time will tell if Obama is out of his league with Vladimir Putin in this regard.
Last week, foreign press outlets began reporting on the shellacking ISIS forces are now taking in the wake of Syria's receipt of heavy weapons and assistance from Russia. It also has not escaped the notice of the foreign press that the Obama administration and some of its NATO allies have made no effort to conceal that they have been supplying ISIS with weapons and fighters. My past references to Obama having created ISIS are now being echoed by foreign press organizations and dignitaries alike.
Within the last 48 hours, Russia claimed that its warplanes are now assailing ISIS positions in northern Syria, stipulating that U.S. strike forces should steer clear of the area. The Pentagon has countered this, saying that the Russian airstrikes are instead hitting Obama's imaginary friends – the "well-vetted" Free Syrian Army and other nonexistent allies of whom we heard so much when Obama wanted Congress to authorize aid to "Syrian rebels."
"We should finally acknowledge that no one but President Assad's armed forces and [Kurdish] militia are truly fighting Islamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria."
– Vladimir Putin, United Nations General Assembly, Sept. 29
Earlier this week, Fox News reported that dozens of Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs) provided by the U.S. to Kurdish allies in Iraq arrived without protective armor. In addition to effectively rendering them "Vehicles" instead of "Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles," they are now essentially death boxes on wheels.
Why would our government supply our allies with such substandard equipment? Because they're not our allies at all, as far as the White House is concerned.
Then, Obama had the temerity to brag on America's successes in the Middle East during an address to the United Nations on Monday. There, he claimed that the overthrow of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi was one such example.
Doubling-down. As potentially dangerous a topic as Libya represents to Obama, you think he'd keep his mouth shut. His oratory also included an admonition to reject "the ignorance that equates Islam with terror" despite Islam's daily confirmation that this equation balances perfectly.
On another front, while increasing numbers of Americans chafe at the belligerent deportment of the homosexual lobby, and amid the recent revelation that the Department of Defense has been facilitating the homosexual rape of boys at the hands of our proto-simian allies on U.S. military bases in Afghanistan, Obama said during a speech at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City Sunday that "our religious freedom doesn't grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights."
Doubling-down again. In addition to the incomprehensible audacity of asserting that the capricious demands of this miniscule faction trumps the free exercise of religion as proscribed in the First Amendment, this is an object lesson in how those on the left employ legalese and constitutional relativism to advance malignant agendas.
Pray tell, what constitutionally guaranteed rights have been denied homosexuals in recent memory? Their perceived "right to marry" is a wholly subjective interpretation of law, and ensuring homosexuals anything under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment is a lube-slathered slope toward their legitimately demanding whatever their perverted little heart's desire in the future. Practical labs in fisting for kindergarteners, anyone?
Does this doubling-down pose risks to Obama, and will he ultimately run out of luck?
Taking into account House Speaker John Boehner announcing Friday that he would step down (as a result of pressure put on the Republican Party by conservatives), many are optimistic that a trend toward jettisoning more of the complicit elements in the GOP leadership might be in the offing. This would be mightily advantageous going into the 2016 election cycle, even considering some of the more diabolical contingencies some of us believe Obama has in mind toward safeguarding his "accomplishments."
If such is the case, perhaps an overconfident Obama is just what the doctor ordered. The political climate that gives rise to a House speaker stepping down could bespeak the coalescing of forces that transcend the power of the Executive Branch – no matter how ruthless the present chief executive happens to be.

Matt Lauer who is famous for hosting TODAY show and his womanizer image is one of the highest-paid anchors of America. The 58-year-old journalist who is married to Annette Roque presently lives in a luxurious mansion and well with a net worth like of his ranging up to millions Matt surely has an envious life which makes people go green.
Matt Lauer's house worth $36.5 million which he recently bought.
Matt Lauer earns a staggering net worth of $60 million which is expected to rise more because of his growing popularity and stardom. Lauer recently also bought a new mansion worth $36.5 million in North Haven that has all the facilities to make it look no less than a mansion.
In addition to it, Matt has an annual salary ranging from $20-25 million. Surely the interview he hosts and the hard labor he does rightfully give him all the rights to enjoy a net worth like that.
NBC's Today show host Matt Lauer and Natalie Morales together for an event.
Matt Lauer started his television career as 1979 working as the producer of the 12’oclock news for a news channel named WOWK-TV in Huntington, West Virginia. Within a year of working as the reporter there, he was already anchoring different newscasts.
With a number of shows in his kitty, he worked for different channels like ESPN, WNEV-TV, and WWOR-TV. Although he was already famous with his works as news presenter he got a major breakthrough in his career when NBC hired him in late 90's.

#NBCNewsForum trend
Matt Lauer is known for his sarcasm and the way he anchors the show. In a recent talk show with the Democratic presidential candidate for US Elections, 2016 Hillary Clinton Matt Lauer was severely talked about for his way of taking the interview.
To the extent that some of the people even predicted that the questions asked by Matt made people feel like Donald Trump could be the next President of America. This is also one of the reasons #NBCNewsForum was trended during September 2016.

The Republican nomination campaign is hurting Republican chances in November

By David W. Brady and Douglas Rivers
Republicans have had long, contested nomination campaigns before, so we have a good idea of what their impact is on the party’s chances in November. The 1996, 2008 and 2012 Republican primaries lasted until the late spring and featured numerous ads with Republicans attacking each other. Bob Dole’s loss to Pat Buchanan in New Hampshire in 1992 extended the campaign and Dole’s finances, which hurt him in the general election. In both 2008 and 2012, the nomination process featured Republicans targeting each other. In each of these years, Republicans suffered high levels of voter defection in the general election. In 1996, almost 20 percent of Republican identifiers did not vote for Dole. In 2008 and 2012, the Republican defection rate was twice as high as it was in 2004. In those same elections, Democratic defections were less than one-half of the Republican rates. Drawn out, nasty primaries hurt parties in general elections.
Since June of 2015, YouGov has been interviewing the same roughly 3,000 people each month. In the past three months, voters were shown a list of all the candidates in both parties and asked which of the candidates they would consider voting for and which they would not consider voting for. Thus, beginning in December and continuing through January and February, we have a running tally of which candidates voters would or would not consider voting for. The trend does not look good for the Republicans. Any of the Republicans.
The chart above shows the trend in the “would-never-vote-for” percentage for each of five remaining Republican candidates over this period. This percentage increases for every candidate. The percentage unwilling to consider Kasich rises from 33% to 44%, Rubio from 35% to 39%, Carson from 39% to 47%, Cruz from 41% to 46%, and Trump from 51% to 55%. The main effect of the nomination campaign has been to increase hard core opposition to Republican candidates.
It’s hard to win an election when almost half of the voters start out unwilling to consider voting for you. The best any Republican candidate does is Rubio, and, for him, nearly two out of every five voters still say “no chance.” In contrast, Democratic candidates are not making things worse for themselves. In December of 2015, 38% of respondents said they wouldn’t vote for Bernie Sanders and in February that percentage still stands at 38%. Hillary Clinton started with high negatives—48% in December---but these have fallen slightly to 47%. In short, Democrats are having a vigorous campaign that has, so far, not hurt their candidates’ chances, while Republicans have been destroying one another.
Rising numbers of voters say they “would never consider voting for this candidate, regardless of who they are running against.”
Even among Republican identifiers, there has been serious damage. The percentage of Republicans saying that they won’t vote for each of the candidates has risen over the past three months. In general elections, winning candidates typically lose less than ten percent of their base. Between 19% (for Rubio) and 35% (for Kasich) of Republicans wouldn’t consider voting for these candidates if they received the Republican nomination. Hillary Clinton doesn’t have the same problem with the Democratic base. Only 12% of Democrats say they would refuse to consider voting for her if she were the Democratic nominee. 17% of Democrats say they won’t vote for Bernie Sanders, but this is a smaller loss than any of the Republican candidates suffer among Republican identifiers. Thus, even among each party’s faithful, the numbers are running against the Republicans, which is especially important for them given that the Democrats are more numerous.
In a recent debate, John Kasich described the fight among Republicans aptly: “This is just crazy.” The Republican nomination campaign is turning into a suicide pact. If the goal is to hurt the chances of a Republican being elected in November, they are succeeding.

U.S. says it might enter Harvard affirmative action court battle
Nate Raymond
3 Min Read
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it might formally enter a lawsuit accusing Harvard University of discriminating against Asian-American applicants as the agency probes its admissions policies for potential civil rights violations.

The department disclosed its plan in a brief urging a federal judge in Boston to not allow the Ivy League school to file pre-trial court papers and documents provisionally under seal.
Harvard had cited the need to protect the privacy of applicants and students as well as the inner workings of its admissions process, arguing that various documents should be initially filed under seal pending the judge’s review.
The Justice Department said it opposed Harvard’s request, joining Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), the group behind the case, which has urged the disclosure of “powerful” evidence showing Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard is violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.
“Harvard College is responsible for protecting the confidential and highly sensitive personal information that prospective students - none of whom asked to be involved in this dispute - entrust to us every year in their applications,” Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane said in a statement.
“We are committed to safeguarding their privacy while also ensuring that the public has the access that it is entitled to under the law,” Dane said.
William Consovoy, a lawyer for SFFA, declined to comment.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled universities may use affirmative action to help minority applicants get into college. Conservatives have said such programs can hurt white people and Asian-Americans.
The Justice Department under Republican President Donald Trump has been investigating a complaint by more than 60 Asian-American organizations which say Harvard’s policies are discriminatory because they limit the acceptance of Asian-Americans.
“The public funds Harvard at a cost of millions of dollars each year, and thus has a paramount interest in any proof of these allegations, Harvard’s responses to them, and the Court’s resolution of this dispute,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in Friday’s filing.
The department said that while it had obtained much of the case’s evidence through its own separate probe, it wanted to review the court records as it considers whether to file a “statement of interest” arguing a position in the case.
A hearing before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs is scheduled for Tuesday.
Harvard says its admissions policies comply with U.S. laws and that it has worked to increase the financial aid it offers to ensure economic, as well as racial, diversity in its classes.

NASA Reports the Ozone is Doing Rather Well Despite Very Bad Conditions
Colder-than-average temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere were ideal conditions for the destruction of our ozone this year but declining levels of ozone-depleting chemicals saved the day!
By Kashyap Vyas
November, 04th 2018
NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio
According to a fresh report by NOAA and NASA scientists, the Ozone hole that develops every September over the Antarctic region was above the average size this year but was smaller compared to what would have been in the year 2000. This healing is essentially due to the declining levels of ozone-depleting chemicals.
Better than 20 years ago
Antarctica is the coldest regions in the world, generating perfect conditions for the destruction of Ozone during the month of September, but due to the declining levels of depleting chemicals prevented the hole from being as huge as it would have been 20 years ago.
"This year's colder temperatures would have given us a much larger ozone hole if chlorine was still at levels we saw back in the year 2000," said Paul A. Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
The research scientists of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that this year's weather was cold enough for almost full depletion of the Ozone layer in a deep 5 km layer over the South Pole region. Active degradation of Ozone occurs on the polar stratosphere clouds in this 3.1-mile deep atmospheric layer.
According to the findings by NOAA, in October, the amount of Ozone reached a minimum of 104 Dobson units (Dobson units is the standard unit used to express the concentration of ozone). Bryan Jhonson, the scientist at NOAA, said that 104 Dobson units of the Ozone layer are amongst the twelfth lowest records out of thirty-three years of the institute's ozonesonde measurements at the Antarctic region.
"Even with this year's optimum conditions, ozone loss was less severe in the upper altitude layers, which is what we would expect given the declining chlorine concentrations we’re seeing in the stratosphere," Johnson said.
What causes Ozone layer depletion?
The Ozone or the O3 molecules get depleted due to their reaction with Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) molecules. When the CFC molecules attain a certain height in the upper atmosphere, they are degraded by the high-frequency Ultraviolet radiations.
The UV Ray splits the CFC's leaving a Chlorine atom which acts as a major catalyst in the destruction of the Ozone layer. On reaction with the free molecule of the Chlorine atom, the ozone molecules disappear and form free oxygen molecules.

NASA Reports That the Hole in the Ozone Layer Is the Smallest It's Been in 30 Years
On an average, a single chlorine atom can destruct almost 100000 Ozone molecules and can stay active for around 100 years.
At first the CFC's were thought to be completely safe, inert and environment-friendly, but later on, it was found out in the research that this compound is the crucial agent in the Ozone hole.
The levels of chlorine in the stratosphere reached to its peak levels in the 2000's and after that with the decline in the use of items producing CFC's lead to the slight decline in the Ozone hole. Despite the reduction in ozone-depleting chemicals, the levels are still high enough to damage the Ozone layer.

Trump Raises Specter Of Supporters Turning Violent If They Don’t Get Their Way
Blogs
March 14, 2019 LogHim.com0
President Donald Trump warned in an interview that his supporters could “play tough” and make things “very, very bad” if they “reach a certain point.” He cited the police, military and Bikers for Trump as his backers.
He didn’t define what that “certain point” might be in the Breitbart interview published Tuesday. But the implication was that his supporters would stand for a limited amount of political decisions that they opposed until the “tough people” made things “very, very bad.” Violence by a military opposed to political decisions would be a coup.
“I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of Bikers for Trump,” he said. “I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.”
The president also noted that the “left” plays it “cuter and tougher.” But he didn’t indicate that the “left” would go overboard at any point.
Trump has hinted at possible violence by his supporters a number of times and has even supported it. During his campaign, he once encouraged supporters to “beat the crap out of” protesters, offering to pay the legal fees of anyone who did.
Trump hinted at possible violence by Bikers for Trump at a campaign rally last year for now-Sen. Josh Hawlery (R-Mo.). “They’re peaceful people, and antifa and all — they’d better hope they stay that way,” he said. The Washington Post said that Trump’s stated “hopes” at various times that the situation will remain peaceful provide him with “plausible deniability” should violence erupt.
But it’s “clear” from his repeated comments that he’s suggesting his supporters from the military, law enforcement and bikers “could be tempted to rise up if things don’t go Trump’s way,” the Post noted.
Trump’s former personal attorney and convicted felon Michael Cohen hinted at an American coup in his testimony before Congress earlier this month, warning that he feared if Trump didn’t win the 2020 election, he wouldn’t peacefully quit the presidency.
“Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen told the House oversight committee.
So Trump wants to send Bikers for Trump to kill honest hard working Americans?
Is that true GOP? You sending Bikers for Trump to kill my family, if you don’t win an election.
I won’t be fearmongered into voting for you.

There is one story that should be the dominant one but it is getting cursory coverage. The President of the United States warned that if things got bad, he had the military, police & Bikers for Trump ready and waiting. The stuff of dictatorships. Normalized in today’s environment
— Norman Ornstein (@NormOrnstein) March 15, 2019
Whether it’s the military, or Bikers for trump, or a bunch of guys dressed up like Surefire corn cobs, there can be NO doubt that trump is calling for VIOLENCE against American citizens who oppose him.
When does the thuggery end?
What kind of PRESIDENT speaks this way??? https://t.co/WWH8h2UD7p
— BrooklynDad_Defiant! (@mmpadellan) March 14, 2019
There are a lot of disturbing implications here, but perhaps the most disturbing part is that Trump is throwing the military and police in the same group as “Bikers for Trump” — all part of his personal gang, charged with carrying out violence on his behalf. https://t.co/hBdT1sBH9a

Psychedelic tourism thrives in Peru with thousands of foreigners visiting jungle retreats to try hallucinogenic tea ayahuasca despite recent lynching of Canadian man

Sitting on a mattress strewn across the floor with white sheets, Pamela Moronci closes her eyes while a traditional healer starts to chant in the indigenous Shipibo language.
In a straw hut, engulfed by the nighttime cacophony of the Amazon rainforest, a shaman inhales a potent tobacco from a pipe and blows smoke on Moronci's head to cleanse her, before she takes her place in a sacred ayahuasca ceremony.
Woman - Cup - Ounces - Bitter - Muddy
He offers the Italian woman a plastic cup with three ounces of a bitter, muddy brew made of psychedelic vines. Moronci drinks it, coughs and smiles despite its unpleasant taste.
'There is a really strong energy here,' she says, before falling asleep, amid the chirping of crickets and thundering rain.
Year - Thousands - Tourists - Jungle - Retreats
Every year thousands of tourists visit jungle retreats in Peru, Colombia and Ecuador to try ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic elixir made of native plants that is thought to heal some mental illnesses.
But while Moronci and others say they have found peace and enlightenment, for a few seekers the experience has been fatal.
Westerners - Curative - Commercialization - Impostors - Dozens
And as more Westerners seek out the legendary curative, commercialization has taken over as profit-seeking impostors pop up among the dozens of legitimate ayahuasca centers that have emerged over the years.
Over the past decade, at least 11 tourists have been killed in incidents linked to traditional medicine in South America, according to news reports, including a California man who was buried secretly by a shaman after he died in an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru.
Killing - Place - April - Village - Nuevo
The latest killing took place in April, not far from the Peruvian village of Nuevo Egipto, where Sebastian Woodroffe, a 41-year-old Canadian man studying medicinal plants, was bludgeoned in broad daylight by an angry mob in retaliation for him allegedly killing a revered traditional healer.
Peruvian investigators later concluded Woodroffe shot healer Olivia Arevalo with a gun he purchased. Now...

GOP candidates make U.S. a laughingstock
Posted on February 27, 2016	by aronsbarron
“Listen to this guy. He has one idea and repeats it over and over again.” “No, you’re the one who repeats himself. You have nothing to say.” “You can’t be trusted. You lie.” “You’re the liar.” “So’s your mother.”
Why don’t you take it outside, fellas.
If you watched the last GOP “debate” before Super Tuesday in hopes of learning anything, you must be sorely disappointed. This demolition derby was worse than a sandlot scrabble among fifth graders. It gave a bad name to a barroom brawl. Disgusting. Mesmerizing in the horrifying way that a car crash compels us to look.
Center stage was Donald Trump, flanked by Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both trying desperately to upstage and undercut Trump, each attempting to represent the true conservative center of the Republican Party. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer was worthless as a moderator, frequently allowing the three to talk at the same time, shouting over each other, in insufferable chaos.
Ohio Governor John Kasich provided the only substance, a voice and tone of moderation, but he was a fringe player. So, too, was retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, whose soporific if civil tone was surpassed by his irrelevancy.
Any viewer hoping for illumination, or anything other than grotesque circus maximus, should be looking beyond this screaming match for someone capable of being the leader of the free world. These clowns make us a joke in the global arena, and, whatever our innate partisan affinities, we are humiliated by this sad lot.

Right on. A disgrace to the Republican party and CNN moderator for allowing this display of out-pissing. Stick and stones will break my bones but names and faces won’t harm me. The public should be reminded of this adage. Is this what the American voters wants and is swayed by? if so, we are in more trouble than we can imagine.

The reality: as Robert Reich has said, the Republican Party died in 2016. (After a long illness).
The “debate” in Houston was a very public conformation of this reality.

The Newsroom is designed for companies writing content that needs to rank in real-time news search results. Today’s news travels fast. Companies that report the news need to be able to create quality ranking content in a timely, efficient manner.
With the Newsroom application, you can enter a focus topic, similar to the Compete and Research applications. You also have the option to select the specific page within your domain you’d like to search from.
After entering your focus topic, you’ll see the options of Brand/People. Those help you find specific brands and people related to your focus topic. For instance, if you type in North Korea, you see related topics like Donald Trump, nuclear war, and others show up in News Topics.
As you can see, “content optimization” is considered a “Hot Topic”--meaning the specific topic has significant overlap within the real-time “News” Top 20 as well as the SERP Top 20. So, the content you create around this topic has a great opportunity to rank in the news and SERP.
Keywords that have a blue dot under SERP presence are those topics that show up in both News Topic 20 and SERP Top 20 and are optimal keywords to consider using for your content.
“Your Distribution” indicates how often that keyword is mentioned on your page/your site. “Suggested Distribution” is the recommended range of times that keyword should be mentioned. Below is a table defining the terms in Suggested Distribution.
Meaning
Suggested Distribution
Zero
0
Low
1-2
Medium
3-9
High
10+
“Variants Count” is the number of related topics to a specific keyword that tracks in the SERP. When you click on one of the keywords, a right sidebar pops up so you can see all of the Variants in “Variants Count.” Below is the Related Topic Variants for content optimization. Some topics that rank lower aren’t searched for often. They will not return any related topic variants, making them the least ideal keywords and variants to use.
You’ll see “Run Research application with the query ‘focus topic’” next to News Topics. Newsroom allows you to use other applications at the same time. Clicking on “Run Research application with the query ‘focus topic’”, will activate the Research application. Follow this link to see what it looks like when the Research application is used.
Continuing down, you see, “Top Stories.” This is where Top News stories about your focus topic may show. If a topic isn’t running in current news, this may be empty.
Last, we have the News Top 20. These are the articles doing best in real-time presence even if they aren’t necessarily in the SERP Top 20.
Similar to the ability to upload data to the Research application, clicking on “Run Compete application with the query ‘focus topic’” will send data to the Compete application. Here you can see a Rank List/Topical of the Web Top 20 to compare to News Top 20 in the Newsroom application.
Within the Rank List, you can see if any of the News Top 20 have a SERP Rank, their MarketMuse News Score (how their content ranks in real-time news), and their word count. Clicking on any of the ranking articles brings up a right-side popup giving you a Head-to-Head of your page versus the competition. You’ll see a breakdown of the distribution of related topics and focus topic as well as current ranks within News/SERP.
As in the Compete application heatmap, the colors indicate a distribution ranking. Red is the lowest, yellow is the next rank, green is in the good range, and blue is in the highest range.
The Topical Heatmap shows the quality of the topic, how those different site pages rank, as well as the ranking/distribution of related topics within each of those specific pages.
Click on the News Rank/SERP Rank number of any of the 20 articles, and you’ll get the Head-to-Head exactly like the one you get when viewing it as a Rank List. Click on the competing website itself in the graph to open a new tab leading to that specific page where you can see the content in full.

The remains of 55 U.S. servicemen killed during the Korean War were transported to Osan Air Base outside Seoul, South Korea, the White House announced Friday.
The cases, each draped with the flag of the United Nations, arrived aboard a U.S. military plane and will soon be presented to their families at long last. It is anticipated that they will arrive in Hawaii on Wednesday.
President Trump celebrated the move on social media, calling it “a great moment for so many families” and thanking North Korean Chairman, Kim Jong Un.
The transfer took place on the 65th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended fighting in the Korean War.
The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States! After so many years, this will be a great moment for so many families. Thank you to Kim Jong Un.

Still, officials estimate roughly 7,700 U.S. soldiers have been listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean War, with 5,300 of the remains believed to be in North Korea.
The Korean War resulted in the death of millions, including roughly 36,000 Americans.
This historic transition had been negotiated last month during a summit in Singapore between Trump and the North Korean leader.
A White House statement praised Kim Jong Un for “fulfilling part of the commitment he made to the President to return our fallen American service members” and said “we are encouraged by North Koreas actions and the momentum for positive change.”

The White House also reminded the American people that this is only part of the historic deal struck between the two nations.
The leaders took “a bold first step to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, transform relations between the United States and North Korea, and establish enduring peace,” the statement reads.
A report surfaced earlier this week indicating that North Korea had begun dismantling its main missile-engine test site, yet another sign that a thaw is taking place between the two countries.
According to the Daily Wire, “Satellite images from July 20 and July 22 show that the North have begun dismantling facilities at their Sohae Satellite Launching Station, which experts believe played a major role in their development of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”
A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise, no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy, all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong, very happy!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2018
The mainstream media has practically been cheering for the improved relations on the Korean peninsula to collapse, though it doesn’t appear we’re headed there anytime soon.
Instead, Trump has since been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, having “taken a huge and important step in the direction of the disarmament, peace, and reconciliation between North and South Korea,” according to a nomination letter written by Norwegian lawmakers.
His opponents would rather have war between North and South Korea than give the President an ounce of credit for establishing peace.

America overrun: Yale study forecasts far larger illegal immigrant population than previous estimates
As POTUS Donald Trump was preparing to bring his “America First” message to the world during his second address to the United Nations this week, professors at Yale University rolled out the results of a highly controversial new study that will only bolster the president’s quest to ‘re-Americanize’ America. For years, experts who study illegal […]

Democrat Beto O’Rourke’s campaign texts called for illegal aliens to vote in U.S. elections
Politically astute Americans are aware that the Democratic Party is moving so far to the Left that many of its rising stars are calling for insane, country-destroying policies like unaffordable “Medicare for all,” the abolishment of ICE and open borders. They know that Democrats are the party of sanctuary cities as well as driver licenses, […]

The Left-wing media’s LAME attempt to reframe the murder of Mollie Tibbetts
Democrats and their sycophantic propaganda wing – the “mainstream” media – are doing their best to downplay the fact that the suspected murderer of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, who was discovered stabbed to death last week, is an illegal immigrant. As The Daily Wire reports, liberal rags like Salon are grasping at every available […]

Alleged murderer who is an illegal alien demands no one call him an illegal alien
The apologists for open borders and unlimited immigration into the United States – legal and illegally – may not be anywhere near a majority of Americans, but they are influential enough that they are at least making inroads into our culture. How else would it be possible for a murder suspect in our country illegally […]
08/22/2018 / By JD Heyes
Disgusting Democrats cling to open borders agenda even as American citizens like Mollie Tibbetts are butchered by illegal aliens
The Democratic Party doesn’t care what happens to you, your family, or your children if any of you get in the way of their political objectives and attempts to retake power. If you do, well, then you’re just casualties of the movement. That’s the only message you can glean from top a Democrat who has […]
08/20/2018 / By JD Heyes
There are established terrorist smuggling routes INTO the U.S. (and Dems want to get rid of ICE?)
The latest rallying cry for the increasingly far-Left Democratic Party is the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement service, as well as open borders and opposition to POTUS Donald Trump’s proposed wall. In fact, as former Secret Service agent, noted conservative pundit, and NRA-TV host Dan Bongino pointed out this week, at recent counter-demonstrations […]
08/02/2018 / By JD Heyes
OMG: Democrat lawmakers are so stupid they don’t even know illegal immigration is ILLEGAL
One of the biggest impediments to rational debate and reasoned disagreement in America today is the Left’s refusal to acknowledge some basic truths – about our country, our culture, our language, our physiology, our history, and our laws. In a piece for National Review titled, “America’s Next Civil War Will Be Worse Than Our Last,” historian […]

The Illegal Alien Chainsaw Massacre: Now playing for real in California
In the 1970s, a film called “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was a low-budget horror flick that became a cult classic, receiving both rave reviews and condemnation for its depravity and violence. That was mostly just a movie, however, though some true events inspired different aspects of the film and some of its characters. But thanks […]

Mexico’s new Left-wing president “builds a wall” along his country’s southern border to stop ILLEGAL immigration into Mexico
Since Donald Trump came down the escalator at Trump Tower in New York City in June 2015 to announce he was running for president and promised to do something about “rapists and murderers” coming into our country from Mexico, he’s been hammered by the far Left for his stance on immigration. But the criticism hasn’t […]

Doctors Without Borders charged with human trafficking, carried out under the guise of “humanitarian” work
A Doctors Without Borders international chapter and several other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been charged with human trafficking under the auspices of doing humanitarian work. As reported by The Gateway Pundit, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) filed criminal charges against seven German-based NGOs including a Doctors Without Borders chapter in the country. It seems as […]

The Blue Ghost or Starfish :)
Me and one of my little OT guys having a “proprioception” break – I was encouraging the starfish look so he could get some resistance into his hands before we started writing. Most of my kids LOVE this thing! 🙂 It’s essentially a Lycra body sock, you climb in (the slit is in the back in this case on this day – for safety it’s ideal if the slit is in the front and that they don’t cover their head, although they can breathe/see pretty well through this one). I prefer my kids be super-covered in their occupational therapy sessions and I monitor them closely but as always, safety comes first so use at your own discretion and with safety awareness. Anyway. Blue ghosts or blue starfishes, awesome. Also, a lot of kids lose some of their inhibitions with this on. Some of my shy, quiet kids get super giggly and extroverted while wearing this thing. The “mask” phenomenon I guess. 🙂 Nice to see.

World Cup: 36 DutchDress hotties arrested after FIFA complaint
FIFA loses this one big time as far as I'm concerned and Bavaria's marketing crew actually deserves an award for this brilliant marketing scheme.
Row over Dutch World Cup skirts | Radio Netherlands Worldwide
FIFA officials discovered them in the Soccer City stadium and reported them to police after the Holland-Denmark duel. The girls wore orange miniskirts, so-called Dutch Dresses, supplied by Bavaria brewery, a competitor of FIFA's official sponsor Budweiser. The officials acted against the Bavaria girls on the basis of the contract with Budweiser, which stipulates that other beer brands are not allowed to advertise in the World Championship stadiums.

Chicago Blackhawks win Stanley Cup! YESSS!
The Blackhawks RULE! Well done guys, congratulations!
YES, Chicago could really use a little boost in its economy right now. I would imagine the Blackhawks jersey (which is already the most popular in all US sports) will probably be selling for a few bucks more.
Chicago is proud, as the only city in the US that has won championships in each of the four major national sports - football, basketball, baseball and now hockey - in the past 25 years! Plus, the Stanley Cup is the most coveted trophy in all American sports and has been around since 1892. How about that!
Obamahawks:
Funny how Obama somehow got injected into the Blackhawks Wikipedia entry earlier and then corrected right after I took this screen shot....haha "Obamahawks"? Who's the fool who did this?

Miss FIFA World Cup Beauty Pageant
Thirty two beauties, each representing her own country, will compete against each other in the World Cup pageant on Friday.
Not sure what the prize is, but I'll be rooting for Algeria because I think she has the cutest smile. Holland will win the FIFA World Cup championship anyway, so I think Algeria deserves to take at least something home after all that nonsense they've been through with Egypt. ;)
All I can find on this odd pageant is pictures with brief headlines and every time something was posted about it on YouTube, the videos got deleted.

DutchDress
Imagine if you had to miss every single world championship soccer game over the years, because your job was to keep an eye on people in the stands at the stadium...wouldn't that bite?
Bavaria says, not anymore, because now there is DutchDress.
Watch this...and do take note of the little green bubble on the screen, which says: Not 16? Not a drop!

Southern California Edison Offers Tips for Keeping Summer Bills Low
Southern California Edison Offers Tips for Keeping Summer Bills Low
July 21, 2010
Media Contact: Vanessa McGrady, (626) 302-2255
ROSEMEAD, Calif., July 21, 2010 – In the wake of the recent heat wave, Southern California Edison (SCE) encourages customers to be more energy efficient now, so they can lower their summer bills. The utility, recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies for its groundbreaking work in energy efficiency, offers multiple solutions for residential and business customers that can help save energy, money and the environment.
“There are so many free and low-cost ways to stay cool and comfortable this summer – while keeping electricity costs in check,” said Gene Rodrigues, SCE’s director of Customer Energy Efficiency and Solar. “Now more than ever, people are interested in saving money and the environment. We’re focused on being able to help our customers do that.”
Here are three steps customers can take to get started:
Take an energy efficiency survey for home or business. The survey provides customized results that outline opportunities for energy savings that even the most energy-conscious customer will find valuable. Visit www.sce.com/survey for homes and www.sce.com/bizsurvey for businesses.
Look for SCE’s rebates and incentives for homes and businesses. Go to www.sce.com/save for residences and www.sce.com/business for businesses. Examples of savings in the home include:
ENERGY STAR-qualified room air conditioners ($50)
Whole house fans ($50)
Energy efficient evaporative cooling systems (from $300-$600)
Refrigerator and freezer recycling program ($50)
ENERGY STAR-qualified refrigerator purchase ($50)
Rebates for businesses include:
Reflective window film ($1.35/per square foot)
Energy-efficient evaporative coolers ($123 per ton)
Package terminal air conditioners mounted on walls ($100)
Make the switch to CFLs. A recent survey revealed that many customers who have bought CFLs, or compact fluorescent lights, are waiting until their current inefficient incandescent bulbs burn out before installing these energy and money-saving bulbs. This delays the tremendous savings the CFLs provide. Not only are CFLs up to 75 percent more efficient, but they emit much less heat, reducing the need for air conditioning. SCE works with manufacturers and retailers to lower the cost of ENERGY STAR-qualified CFLs in SCE territory, so that price is not a hindrance to its customers.
Other ways to keep power usage down this summer include drawing drapes to keep sunlight out; keeping the air conditioning at 78 degrees or above; shutting off vents and doors to unoccupied areas to direct cool air only to the rooms you're using; using a microwave or barbecue for cooking instead of the stove; and running a fan, which makes a room feel 5 degrees cooler.
In addition, customers can find more energy-saving solutions at www.sce.com/tips or by calling SCE at 1(800) 655-4555.
About Southern California Edison
An Edison International (NYSE:EIX) company, Southern California Edison is one of the nation’s largest electric utilities, serving a population of nearly 14 million via 4.9 million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile service area within Central, Coastal and Southern California.

62 Afghan men rounded up for deportation
TOPICS:62 Afghan menDeportationNorwayPolice
Police.Photo: Norway Today Media
Posted By: Gerard Taylor 19. November 2016
In the past few days, police have arrested and detained 62 Afghan men for immediate expatriation.
In total, police arrested 73 men, who were held in refugee centers across the country, wrote Aftenposten on Friday night.
11 were released because the Police Immigration Department didn’t consider them a risk for evading expulsion, while 62 were sentenced to detention by Oslo District Court on Wednesday and Thursday.
The reason for many of the expulsions is that the men are older than they specified, they are over 18 years of age. Only five of the detainees had entered a date of birth before 1991.
When an asylum application is rejected by the Immigration Directorate (UDI), the applicant may appeal the decision to the Immigration Appeals Board (UNE). If the complaint is rejected, the applicant is usually granted four weeks’ notice to leave the country.
‘All the subjects were informed about the decision by the UNE after they were arrested’, confirmed police to the newspaper Aftenposten.
The Norwegian Organization for Asylum Seekers believes the authorities’ practice is unfortunate, saying ‘it weakens the asylum seekers’ opportunities to examine the decision closely. It also deprives asylum seekers of the possibility of applying for funding for return to their home country’.

Do I Qualify for Subsidies if Spouse Has Medicare?
Twitter
Facebook
I’m 64, resident of Al. Currently have coverage thru husband’s employer. My husband will retire in May and be on Medicare. I need coverage May-Sept when I get Medicare. Will I qualify for subsidy based on MY current year income of $9600. Or will it be based on our JOINT income this year of $140,000 even tho husband will NOT be applying since he will have Medicare?
How can I find out what my premium would be for me alone and whether I would get subsidy WITHOUT going through entire application? I’m trying to see whether Obamacare or Cobra would be less expensive
Answer
Marketplace subsidies are based on household income, even if one spouse qualifies for non-Marketplace coverage like Medicare. That being said, subsidies are based on projected household income for the next year, although they typically use last years income to estimate next years. Since your husband will retire this could drop your actual household income and thus qualify you for cost assistance. You'll be able to take advantage of special enrollment, starting at least 30 days before you lose your current coverage, to enroll in a plan that starts when you lose your current coverage.
In your case COBRA will be more expensive if you get subsidies, if you don't then it's a toss up depending upon what COBRA offers and the plans in your region. Typically holding a policy for a limited time isn't good for much beyond catastrophic coverage, benefits covered by copays, and avoiding the fee.

I am on medicare and my husband’s income is 20, 000 a year. Combined we have 90,000 annually with my pension. He works and his jobs insurance is far too high. Can he qualify for marketplace Obamacare?
Reply
ObamaCareFacts.com on October 7, 2015
Your combined household MAGI is most likely too high to get cost assistance through ObamaCare, despite the cost of the employer coverage it is most likely your best option. Having access to employer coverage also prevents you from cost assistance, so this reinforces that. You can still apply to the marketplace during open enrollment and see what your options are, anyone can get a plan, but only certainly people are eligible for cost assistance.

The question isn’t fully answered. For example, I am 58, my wife is 67 and on medicare. When I go through the questions about coverage on my BCBS online renewal application it indicates that because our family receives medicare then I do not qualify for a subsidy even though our family income for 2015 will be around 40,000. This doesn’t make sense, but then regulations and tax law never do so I am asking if this is correct, that I can’t qualify under any circumstances for a subsidy because my wife is on medicare.

ObamaCareFacts.com on November 1, 2015
Any family member who doesn’t qualify for Medicare can get a family plan and qualify for a subsidy based on income for that coverage.
As long as the person on Medicare isn’t on the plan it shouldn’t matter.
This can be backed up by looking directly at page 9 of the instructions of form 8962 (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf). The instructions walk through an example where a family member qualifies for Medicare mid year and the family retains the tax credits for the family member who stayed on a subsidy eligible plan.
You may want to have BCBS clarify what they meant. Make sure you are buying a tax credit eligible plans sold on the Health Insurance Marketplace.

This is very interesting as I also lost the premium tax credit when my husband became eligible for Medicare in March 2015 due to disability. The requirement is to be married filing jointly which we still do. I feel I was penalized because he is disabled. How fair and affordable is that? It is frustrating arguing with Marketplace Customer service when they contradict what the guidelines state.

ObamaCareFacts.com on April 17, 2016
Well I know you have to file the allocation part, but it shouldn’t affect household income, MAGI, or family size (so it shouldn’t affect the credit)… although now that you say this i’m going to re-read the 8962 instructions to see if i’m missing something.
Taking example 2 on page 12 at face value (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf) it instructs to adjust for coverage family and complete the allocation, but it doesn’t specifically insinuate that you should get less credits… if anything I would assume you would get more as that is one less from the coverage family, but no change to the tax family or household income compared to the poverty level.
With that said, we can see how simplifying this process should be on the table. The ACA and IRS in general is so insanely fair it creates a lot of paperwork and rules, i’m not sure this is the most elegant longterm solution… but back to the topic, i’ll be looking into this one. Anyone else feel free to post with details below.

The problem is in the Monthly Contribution Amount as it relates to the SLCSP. If one spouse is not eligible for PTC or is enrolled in a MEC plan, (as far as I can tell) the calculations do nothing to reduce the Monthly Contributions Amount by the amount that your Tax Family has to pay for premiums for the MEC. As a result, the family ends up paying more for medical insurance premiums than the calculated Contribution Percentage that is based on Tax Family size and MAGI. Basically, the PTC doesn’t work for your family if you have to pay premiums for both a Marketplace plan (say to cover spouse and or children) and another plan such as employer or state/federal provided insurance. Your Tax Family Monthly Contribution can easily exceed your SLCSP for your Coverage Family if you are a Tax Family of 2 and a Coverage Family of 1. Please tell me if I am missing something!! BTW, I think that Medicare Part A is considered MEC, but most of us still have to pay for Part B and Part D or pay for an Advantage plan.

Actually you are simply only seeing one side of this. It is fair, because if person on Medicare is the only breadwinner then the family wouldn’t have insurance options without that income being counted. Of course, when the situation is not this it feels very unfair. I get that. It would be nice if the family could choose, or in states where Medicaid was expanded, if Medicaid didn’t count that income.

Jennifer Blue on June 2, 2016
Yes, our overall medical premiums increased $65/ month when my husband went on Medicare. However, we are still paying almost a third of what we had to pay per month before Obamacare. As self employed people, our insurance premiums were financially crushing us. Also, before Obamacare, BCBS routinely denied coverage of care clearly covered by the policy, and was consistantly miserable to deal with. Obamacare is far from ideal, but the system pre Obamacare was leaving far too many uninsured and causing medical bankruptcies. I think my husband’s income should still count when he switched to Medicare becuase it is still family income! Hopefully, Obamacare will improve, but I greatly prefer the level of “screwing” I get from Obamacare over the absolute insanity and massive “screwing” of the previous system.

This is so true!!! I will be going on Medicare in April and my family will be penalized because they will no longer get the subsidy attributed to me (although they love to include my income). Bottom line, I will be paying MORE for my entire family once I go on Medicare. Thank God I’m not retired yet!!!

This is a very lame technical problem with the Affordable Care Act. Please consider writing to your legislators and letting them know that you are having this problem. Legislators (and possibly the Social Security Administration) are the ones who can make the change necessary to the law.

the answer is correct but is so un-fair. Why should the cost of ACA be based on both incomes when only only spouse need ACA ??? This is out right discrimination of most of the senior house wholes in the USA. Most house whole one spouse is to young to get medicare and needs ACA while the other spouse is old enough to receive medicare. talk about age discrimination

Dayna Allen on April 11, 2016
My question is similar but in my case I’m 59 and my husband is 65 and going on medicare. Based on the household income of 48000 our coverage costs $4/month but when he goes on medicare and we start paying for medicare at approx. $120/month then the younger one has to pay $140 or so. So now we’ll be paying $260/month. I don’t think the younger persons subsidy should have changed so drastically.

ObamaCareFacts.com on April 11, 2016
Well you still count family income and family size for the ACA, even if someone has Medicare in the family. Only stipulation is that they can’t get coverage. I agree though, your experience seems odd. Maybe something else has happened? You may want to clarify with the marketplace, the upfront tax credits are advancements (it is possible to over-or-under-take credits).

I have just got off the phone with a representative at the Marketplace.gov as I had to report a life change, and I feel I’m being well and truly screwed.
My wife and I had a family plan through the Market place, she goes on Medicare in a few days as she is disabled at the age of 57.
Her Medicare premium is going to be around $130 my new Market place premium is now $190, we had been paying $168 for the family plan.
I expected like many, for my portion of the market place family plan to be less not more. Income hasn’t change just the fact my wife no longer has coverage through the market place. This can’t be right.

kathy d. on June 4, 2016
As I understand it, the premium should stay the same when one spouse goes on Medicare, presuming the income stays the same, but you also have to then pay the Medicare premium. You come out behind because of that and also because the Medicare participant’s expenses won’t count toward the same out of pocket limit the rest of the family has on the Marketplace plan. When things get tough, the plans get tougher.

Neal on July 19, 2016
I am unschooled in these matters, but given what Kathy has said, I don’t understand why someone with a spouse and an affordable ACA plan would ever choose to go on Medicare. Perhaps sometimes the choice is forced? And recognizing the situation after the fact, is it not possible to change one’s mind, drop Medicare and go back to the ACA plan?

Medicare has very specific rules. Once you are eligible for Medicare you can no longer get a private non-Medicare plan. So that may be the answer.

Approaching my 65th birthday and attended a local seminar,,,Medicare is required coverage at age 65 and it is “illegal” for me to keep Obamacare once eligible for Medicare. My Medicare Part A & Part B information and card arrived in the mail last week, with the option to keep or discard Part B, and the option to get other available plans like Medicare advantage which combines Part A, B,C,D etc. My spouse is age 58 and will have to keep current Obamacare, regardless of cost, for the rest of the year and shop for coverage for 2017.
Reply
ObamaCareFacts.com on July 20, 2016
Yes, this is all correct. The one plus is that your spouse will still use household income to determine subsidies. Thus, at some incomes this works out to a great deal (in my opinion better than Medicare cost-wise), but only at some incomes.

Harry on August 7, 2016
I am preparing to retire. My spouse is 58. I have been checking locally for the ACA policies available. Without any assistance from the ACA I would pay a monthly premium of 890 dollars for a silver plan. With the deductible my out of pocket for my spouse will be 14000 dollars a year. Now to qualify for a ACA subsidy you need to have a family income between 100% and 400% of the poverty income level. When qualifying it asks the family size. Would my spouse family size be 1 or 2 when qualifying?
In real numbers it means the following,
Family size of 1 : 11880 – 47520.
Family size of 2 : 16020 – 64080.
Does my spouse family income fall between a family size of 1 or 2?
In my state for 2016 they were allowed by the Insurance commission a 25% increase in premiums.
In my state for 2017 they are already allowed by the Insurance commission a 35% increase in premiums
I have nothing good to say about ACA.

I think I have a unique situation or at least it seems so. I am 64(laid off of work) and my wife of 44 years is 71 years old. She did not acquire enough work credits to qualify for social security or medicare even though she had 20 work credits. I am paying medicare 532.00 dollars per month for her Medicare and 60.00 dollars per month for her Medi-gap plan. Her monthly co-payments for prescriptions average approximately 150.00 per month. I am on ACA and I pay 300.00 per month. I live on a pension of 20.000 dollars per year and I pay approximately 1150 per month for medical expenses only which leaves less than 500 dollars to live on. When I started on ACA my premiums started at 20.00 dollars per month, then jumped to 160 dollars per month and are now 300 per month, but yet my income remained the same. Is there any advice you can give me towards my dilemma.
Reply
ObamaCareFacts.com on September 12, 2016
If your MAGI income is right around the 100% poverty level you might be dipping below the subsidy cliff and thus losing credits. Likewise, if your income is over 400% you might be dipping over the cliff on that side. I can’t exactly tell which would be happening, but it seems like you may be going under 100%. So this would be one thing to consider.
My general advice is make sure you are using the exchange, and make sure you are getting the credits you should be as explained on form 8962 and 8965.
I know that isn’t a simple answer, but it includes all the elements you need. My guess is that its either confusion over Medicare or the poverty level that is leaving you not getting the credits you should be.

I will go on medicare this year but my wife is 8 years younger than me and will be on Obamacare. We are both retired/housewife. Since our joint household income is about 50K from dividends and interest, we get premium aid. But from now on, since only one is on obamacare, our aid is reduced plus I have to pay the premium for medicare. So our personal costs go up from 100 to 500 per month. Is there any way I can reduce it? Why are we getting penalized because one of us crossed the magical age of 65?

She pays united Healthcare $450 per month for limited coverage with a $12,000 deductible She even has to pay federal income taxes on most of the premium amount! If this is not a scam then tell me what is?? She was discriminated more than once!! And on top of that the Social Security dual entitlement clause cheats her again!!

ObamaCareFacts.com on September 25, 2017
The spouse gets assistance based on family size and MAGI (AGI adjusted) income regardless of who else in the tax family qualifies.
Doing the math is a little heady, it means knowing family size compared to the federal poverty level, cost of second lowest cost silver plan in your state, and the amount credits are adjusted by on form 8962. Instead of trying to brave that, try out KFF’s handy calculator.

My husband and I have health care subsidy – we make less than 63,000 annually. He will be elgible for medicare on august 19, 2018. How will this change my insurance coverage and will I have to change my government health care and find an individual coverage. Kaiser says 3 month notice before cancellation – our annually wage stays the same – just me who needs coverage and looks like if I change the subsidy to one person would be like $650 per month for me??

ObamaCareFacts.com on December 22, 2017
The mandate was removed in the tax bill, so moving forward you won’t owe the penalty.
However this would have been more questionable in the past due to you being just above the poverty level in terms of income.
https://obamacarefacts.com/federal-poverty-level/
That said, even then, you should have been able to get an exemption due to being in the range that would qualify you for Medicaid expansion (if your state didn’t expand and you applied and can’t get it, then you are exempt from the fee).
I would call the marketplace and discuss this with them though.

When you switch to Medicare in a two person family, the other person is technically supposed to switch to an individual plan. Then the tax credits are accounted for on form 8962.
Honestly it isn’t the simplest transition, I would start by calling heatlhcare.gov and getting advice from them.
Also, if you used a private broker for Medicare, ask for their help.
With all this said, if you can start your Medicare on January 1st (Due to where you are in initial enrollment) I think it might make your life easier. Again though, this is a little more complex than one might think and you’d want to get advise direct from healthare.gov or a broker to make sure your transition is smooth and you fully understand your options.

If a spouse goes on disability/Medicare, the other spouse shouldn’t be penalized and should be able to stay on healthcare.gov based on their MAGI since the disability will be a lesser amount.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: A Texas federal judge ruled the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) unconstitutional on Dec 14 2018. The Justice Department then affirmed its support for the ruling in late March 2019. For now nothing changes as the appeals process play out. However, there could be real consequences down the road. Learn more about the 2018 ObamaCare ruling.

Inspiring Words
Posted on November 28, 2018
As we end 2018, Ohio IPL is featuring some motivational quotes around the theme “We Are All Connected”. Below are some chosen inspiring quotes from supporters. Leave your quote in the comment section below, or go to our Facebook page and add your own quote there! We all could use a little inspiration! Why does the quote inspire you and why are you called to do the work of climate justice?
Make a contribution to Ohio IPL today and “Be Connected” to those who are seeking climate justice and a moral response to caring for the Earth and our neighbors.
Submitted by Meribah Mansfield, Ohio IPL Board Co-Chair
Having been involved with Ohio Interfaith Power & Light for over 10 years, I have become aware of the intersection of racial justice and eco-justice and have come to understand that the more that we care for each other, the more we care for creation, and vice versa. I more fully appreciate the beauty of creation when I see the beauty in myself and in all of God’s children, including all gender identities, colors, races, sexual orientation and classes. As James Cone said in his Sojourners article, “Whose Earth is it Anyway?”: “The fight for justice cannot be segregated but must be integrated with the fight for life in all its forms.”
~Rev. Meribah Mansfield, Ohio IPL Board Chair
Submitted by Shannon Steward, Ohio IPL Board Co-Chair
“If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.”
–Aboriginal activists group, Queensland, 1970s
This quote, generally attributed to Lilla Watson but appropriately born from a collective process, lived inside of me long before I knew someone had already come along and articulated it. In the same way that planets curve and mold the fabric of the universe, creating gravity that pulls on everything around them, every single thing I do impacts other humans and non-humans on this Earth. The things I say, the choices I make, and the problems I choose not to address can hurt other people, and so it’s only natural that we can better each others’ lives, as well. When we work for justice, we work together. When we work for safety, it’s each others’ safety. And when we fight for the climate, we fight for a planet we all share.
DONATE TODAY!
“When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.” ~John Muir
“The world is holy. We are holy. All life is holy. Daily prayers are delivered on the lips of breaking waves, the whisperings of grasses, the shimmering of leaves.”
~Terry Tempest Williams
“For our brief time on this wonderful planet, we must bow deeply to one another, to Earth, and to all other sentient beings, and resist with the power of love anything that creates or stands as a barrier between ourselves and the whole kingdom of life.” ~Alycee J. Lane

Face Time: Donald Trump
By
Simon Mills
-
March 10, 2018
For a big man with such a huge ego Donald Trump has very small hands. Not just on the end of his arms either – but on his watch dial also. The US President favours a rather dainty, feminised style of wristwatch, his most celebrated timepiece being an as-yet unidentified number with a girlie gold band and a dainty, wafer-slim case that he wears on the golf links at Mar-a-Lago. The marque isn’t significant here – maybe a Piaget, or could it be a ladies’ Seiko circa 1982? It’s more the way that the Donald chooses to wear it – clamped really tightly around his chubby wrist to an almost tourniqueted level of discomfort. It must numb his left hand something rotten, chafe on his skin and play minor havoc with his swing off the tee.
Rolex Day Date Yellow Gold
Still, the President does have other options in his oddly skewed, apparently randomly-acquired horological portfolio. The world’s most powerful man has been spotted rocking a Rolex Day-Date in yellow gold, a Patek Philippe Ellipse in yellow gold with a blue dial and integrated bracelet, and a Vacheron Constantin Historiques Ultra-Fine 1968 in pink gold. Trump gave away his own Universal Geneve Ayrton Senna chronograph, donating to Antiquorum’s Famous Faces Watch Auction back in 1999.
Donald Trump wears his Vacheron Constantin Historiques Ultra-Fine 1968.
Occasionally he has been seen sporting an Azad Power Tourbillon in stainless steel (nope, us neither), which was a gift from the Azad online retailer to celebrate Trump’s work as host on the US version of The Apprentice in 2009. He also paid $7,000 for former President Ronald Reagan’s vintage Colibri wristwatch at a charity auction in 1999.
Patek Philippe Ellipse
Fired up by his prestigious acquisition, six years later Trump had a ham-fisted, down market attempt at borrowing the elegant stylings of such classics as the Heuer Monaco and the Rolex Daytona for his own line of ‘Donald J. Trump Signature Collection’ branded watches. “Time is money so the watch you wear matters,” said the Donald-endorsed blurb that accompanied the product. “Using only the highest quality materials, these watches are solid, great-looking and above all, accurate, designed to be on the money every time.” Classy, right?
Donald Trump at Macy’s Department Store in New York for the launch of his watch collection.
Unfortunately (and perhaps more accurately) the watches – on sale at Macy’s department store in New York – were actually more like the sort of brassy tat you might win yourself at a fairground, and the low quality of materials used meant that they were also prone to tarnishing.
This meant that the venture failed within a year and, discounting the odd small town pawn shop or occasional garage sale, Trump watches are no longer available. We’re weeping too…

Privacy International Launch Legal Bid Against GCHQ
Civil Liberty group Privacy International have today filed a legal claim against GCHQ, demanding that the government spooks stop collecting data from those who are not suspected of committing a crime. The existence of “Bulk Personal Datasets” that contain “personal information about a wide range of people” was revealed in Intelligence and Security committee report released in March.
The complaint was filed to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the only judicial body with the power to investigate GCHQ. For the first time this year, the IPT ordered the Cheltenham spooks to destroy illegally obtained documents. Let’s hope they’ve started a precedent…

Quote of the Day
Dr Alexander Kogan, the app developer who originally harvested the Facebook data, said…
“I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic and made claims this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it’s not that. If you sit down and you really work through the statistics and you think what does a correlation of point three means, those claims quickly fall apart. And that’s something any person with a statistical background can go and do.”

Roy Moore Is Heavy Favorite In Alabama Senate Runoff
Home Roy Moore Is Heavy Favorite In Alabama Senate Runoff
Subscribe David Thornton, August 24, 2017 August 23, 2017 , David Thornton, Politics and Current Events, 2017 Elections, Alabma, Luther Strange, Roy Moore, senate, 0
A new poll shows that former judge Roy Moore has a landslide-size lead in the runoff to decide which Republican faces the Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama’s special Senate election. The poll by JMC Analytics found that Moore currently has a lead of almost 20 points over Luther Strange, the sitting Senator appointed to fill the seat of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The poll, which contacted Alabamans from across the state, found that 51 percent of respondents who were considering voting in the runoff favored Moore. Thirty-two percent planned to vote for Strange with 17 percent undecided.
The big surprise from the poll was how ineffective the Republican endorsements of Strange have been. President Trump carried Alabama with 62 percent of the vote last year, but his endorsement of Strange seems to have had no net effect at all. The poll found that 51 percent said that Trump’s endorsement made no difference. The remainder were split almost evenly between those who said that Trump’s endorsement helped Strange (25 percent) and those who said it hurt him (23 percent).
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fared even worse. Forty-six percent said McConnell’s endorsement made no difference while 45 percent said it made them less likely to support Strange. Only 10 percent seemed to value McConnell’s endorsement.
Sixty-eight percent self-identified as evangelical Christians. Roy Moore, who is considered a hero by many Christians for his battles to keep a monument to the Ten Commandments in the State Supreme Court building and for his refusal to uphold the Supreme Court ruling instituting same-sex marriage, has a definite advantage among Christian voters. The poll shows Moore with 58 percent support among evangelicals.
Luther Strange has been bedeviled by several corruption scandals. Strange, the former attorney general of Alabama, was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Robert Bentley who was forced to resign in disgrace. Strange, who was in charge of the investigation into Bentley’s extramarital affair and the ensuing cover-up and abuses of power, has been accused of delaying the impeachment proceedings against the former governor.
Strange and many other Alabama politicians also took donations from two companies that are accused of paying outright bribes to state legislator Oliver Robinson. The $360,000 in bribes were associated with an Alabama coal company’s attempt to avoid paying for the EPA cleanup of a toxic site.
Finally, Strange s the subject of an investigation into two felony campaign finance violations. An ethics hearing was originally scheduled for August 2, but was moved to August 16, the day after the initial primary election.
Moore was the top finisher in the first round of polling with 38 percent to Strange’s 32 percent. Pre-election polling had showed the two men in a virtual dead heat. Since neither candidate received a majority, a runoff was scheduled for Sept. 26. The general election will be on Dec. 12.
The new poll was conducted among 515 likely voters and the margin of error is 4.3 percent.

Sweatshops in Jordan
Dean Baker
May 3, 2006
Steven Greenhouse had an excellent piece in today's New York Times about sweatshops in Jordan that manufacture apparel for export to the United States. This industry has been developed largely as a result of a trade agreement that Jordan signed with the United States in the late nineties. The article describes slave-like conditions, as foreign workers routinely have their passports confiscated by factory owners so that they cannot freely leave. According to the article, workers can be forced to work up to 48 hours straight, are routinely ripped off for their pay, and are beaten if they complain.
Two aspects of the article raise especially interesting questions. First, the article indicates that the apparel jobs have gone almost exclusively to foreign (largely Bangladeshi) workers. It is unlikely that the trade agreement was sold in Jordan based on the jobs that it would create for guest workers. The benefits to Jordan's economy from this trade would be very limited.
Second, the Jordan trade pact actually included language on labor standards, unlike other trade deals of the last fifteen years. The conditions reported in this article suggest that this language has not had much impact on actual labor conditions.

Report: Obamacare to raise premiums in Texas
by EDGAR WALTERS
The Affordable Care Act will increase the average cost of insurance premiums, making health care less affordable for those Texans on whom the system financially depends, according to a report from a conservative think tank.
The report, released Monday by the Texas Public Policy Foundation, says that premiums for health insurance plans will increase for young, healthy Texans under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The health care law requires private insurers to cover essential health benefits and establishes a federal marketplace for insurers to sell coverage plans, among other requirements.
The report concludes that premiums will be on average “significantly higher than coverage available on the individual market in Texas prior to the ACA.” Nonetheless, it concedes that comparing pre- and post-ACA health care plans “presents some difficulties” because of the costs associated with mandating that health plans cover essential benefits, and because the impact on individuals will vary depending on age, gender, location and other factors.
As an example, the report highlights changes in premiums for catastrophic plans for young people living in metropolitan areas. Catastrophic plans have lower premiums than comprehensive plans but provide protection only from worst-case scenarios. John Davidson, the report’s author, said those plans are the most attractive to young, healthy Texans, and that they operate “the most like insurance” of any health care plan in the insurance marketplace.
“For a 27-year-old, non-smoking male in Austin, low-cost catastrophic plans on the exchange, which are available only to those under 30 or those with low incomes who qualify, will be on average 84 percent more expensive than pre-ACA catastrophic plans,” the report found.
Proponents of the health care law say, however, that the comparisons are misleading.
Stacey Pogue, a senior policy analyst for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, says the pre-ACA premiums — what she calls “teaser rates” — analyzed in the report do not reflect average rates paid on the individual market. “These are the advertised rates by insurers,” she said. “Some young, healthy people get the teaser rate, but certainly not everybody does. To represent that as the average rate is misleading.”
Davidson rebuffs the term “teaser rate,” preferring “listed rate.” “Rather than just take the lowest one that was advertised, we averaged the three lowest ones we could find to come up with an average picture of the low-cost catastrophic rates in Texas,” he said.
Plans available under the Affordable Care Act are more comprehensive, Pogue said. They cover more medical services, including pre-existing conditions, and have lower out-of-pocket maximum costs. On the other hand, the pre-ACA insurance market is one “where the policies you can buy are full of holes, whether it’s mental health coverage or out-of-pocket costs that can be up to $13,000 a year,” Pogue said.
Davidson agrees that policies will change under the Affordable Care Act, and he attributes their higher costs to those changes. “It’s precisely because of the changes in the plans that they’re more expensive,” he said. “And they’re most expensive for the people who had the ability to get the cheapest insurance before the ACA.”
The federal government will offer relief for some facing higher costs in the marketplace. Texans with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold will qualify for subsidies to offset higher health insurance premiums. Texans below the federal poverty line will not qualify for those subsidies and are instead encouraged to apply for Medicaid, although many will not qualify for Medicaid either. Gov. Rick Perry and the Texas Legislature did not to expand the program to cover impoverished adults, with many citing concerns about a system they say is not efficient.
The TPPF report says that many Texans in their late 20s and early 30s will not qualify for subsidies because their incomes are too high. “Young, working Texans are most likely to bear the brunt of these higher costs,” the report says. “Premiums for ACA-compliant plans for Texans in their late 20s and early 30s are significantly higher than pre-ACA plans currently on the individual market.” The report says those individuals have little incentive to follow the ACA mandate that they enroll in an insurance plan, and predicts that many will instead opt to pay a fine rather than sign up for a plan.
Health care officials say the exchange system under the ACA will depend on having a broad participant base, not just the elderly and afflicted.
“The success of the program is really contingent on young, healthy adults being able to broaden the risk pool and pay premiums to allow them to be more affordable for the older, sicker populations,” said David Gonzales, executive director of the Texas Association of Health Plans.
But Gonzales was hesitant to draw comparisons between pre- and post-ACA coverage. Asked whether rates had gone up, he said, “Unless you’re comparing apples and apples, it’s hard to really know.”

This article fails to mention whether the pre-ACA catastrophic plans being used for comparison are those which didn’t include coverage for essentials such as hospitalization, pregnancy, and other cost factors that render those plans “substandard” (as the President has explained). It is impossible to make an honest comparison without considering these factors so the purpose and validity of this article seem dubious, especially considering that the title, and the opening paragraph imply that the ACA “will increase the average cost of insurance premiums” as if the fact that some of the plans were not of a vastly inferior quality. Instead of making the quality and cost factors clear though, the article fails to challenge the suggestion that the very limited plans are “the most like insurance”, but that definition of insurance would better suit a game of chance than a health-care plan. And so yea, coverage that actually ‘covers’ is more expensive, but that is about all there is to it. And accordingly, that would make for an honest title: ‘Coverage That Actually Covers Costs More’.

Here’s a concrete example for you…..before the nightmare that is Obamacare, I had a health insurance policy that covered myself and my family for $1,050 per month. Our deductible was $2,000 and our max out of pocket was $5,000.
Because of Obamacare, my insurance company cancelled that plan and now wants to (a) sell me that same plan back for $1,400 per month or (b) have my switch to the exchange where my premiums would be similar but I would now have a $6,000 deductible and a $10,000 annual out of pocket maximum.
So my choices are to pay 40% more for the same coverage or to pay the same amount for about 1/3 of the coverage.
It’s the biggest rip off ever perpetrated on the American people, and I hope Obamacare dies a screaming ugly death.

Dano,
If your carrier cancelled your policy it is because it failed to meet the minimum requirements of coverage under the ACA. So, you are making the “apples to oranges” comparison mentioned in the last paragraph of the article. Your claim then, that your insurer “now wants to (a) sell me that same plan back” is disingenuous. Millions of consumers were simply being mislead into thinking that they had cheap coverage when what they had was coverage not worth having.

Ray, the point is Dano is a sophisticated insurance buyer who can determine better than you, and certainly better than the government, what plan best meets the needs of his family. He balanced the likelihood of risk of some things it might not cover, such as pregnancy, against the savings. Now, he doesn’t get to make that choice because the government determined something he had was “substandard” and that he should pay a lot more for coverage that will not materially change his health care costs, such as pregnancy.
“Coverage not worth having” is a ridiculous statement. I have a high deductible plan for my family and we essentially self-pay the little stuff. I can afford to do that out of the savings on insurance premiums, and the insurance is there if my health care costs in a given year get higher than I can afford. That makes the most sense for my family. I don’t need an insurance plan that covers when I get a cold, because I know I will get a cold about once every two years and I can afford to pay for it when I do. This is the same reason I do not need grocery insurance, because I know I am going to buy groceries, I plan ahead on paying for the groceries, and it is within my financial ability to pay for those myself when we need them. Nonetheless, thanks to the not so smart folks in DC, I now pay 20% more every month and get no greater benefits. That is what happens when you put a government (incapable of doing anything well) in charge of more.

skeptical,
You are simply making another disengenuos argument. You are using ‘pregnancy’ coverage while ignoring ‘hospitalization’ and other loopholes that the “substandard’ plans use to limit costs. At 57 I couldn’t even venture a guess as to how many times I’ve heard consumers complain about paying for insurance only to not have coverage when they most needed it, but many, many. You are also forgetting that it is the government (us) that ends up paying for the care when the insurers don’t, so if people who can afford new cars and flat-screen TVs and $400 a game football tickets, are unable to pay for their health-care costs, how would you suggest we solve this problem if not through the government. Remember too that we are in the throes of a diet-related disease epidemic and a job crises, and our exports can’t be competitive with our health-care costs double that of our competitors…and rising at twice the rate too.

Nothing about my plan was “sub-standard”. It was simply that my plan was established after the deadline where plans could be “grandfathered”. It covered hospitalization, it covered pregnancy, and it covered mental health. But most importantly, it gave me the coverages that *I* wanted based on *my* knowledge of my family’s age, health, etc.
The bottom line:
It’s none of the government’s damn business to come into *my* life and force me to purchase coverage that *I* don’t want or need – and make me pay hundreds more per month for it (or to accept the alternative, which is having MUCH crappier coverage for the things I *do* need/want for the same price I’m paying now).

Dano,
So you believe that ‘We the People'(the guv) have no right to regulate. But what about those who would suffer or die without our aid? Do we simply let them die along the road? And when our population becomes too unhealthy to be competitive globally do we just ignore that fact. And when the markets fail to keep wages in pace with health-care costs do we simply ignore such facts and pretend that the labor markets are not manipulated by immigration policies and government interference of collective bargaining? Or is regulation by We The People acceptable in regards to immigration or labor markets, but not Health-care.
Anyway Dano, we are a nation and we can’t all take every advantage. Consider for example what would happen if everyone followed your idealism: “it gave me the coverages that *I* wanted based on *my* knowledge of my family’s age, health, etc.”. Accordingly, what happens when market forces encourage insurers to offer plans tailored to every want and need? Company X for instance offers a policy with the entire pool consisting of 26 to 35 year old men with perfect BMIs and blood pressure ratings, and etc., and with a requirement to do 100 push-ups and run 5 miles in less than 30 minutes. This would be a low-cost pool of course but then what happens if this process is continued across the full-spectrum of society, pool by pool? Well, when we continue to exclude for all potential cost factors we end-up with pools of people who have extremely high cost factors and most of them would not be able to afford insurance. So what do… We the People do?

Anyway Dano,
Your unsupported claim: “It’s the biggest rip off ever perpetrated on the American people”, can not be supported in any honest way. The ACA has what is called a Minimum Loss Ratio Provision which allows States to regulate what percentage of each premium dollar that the insurers can keep (that being about 20%). And so, that regulation, (along with many others), limits the “rip off”. The simple truth is that our country has become unhealthy and so the demand for health-care is allowing medical professionals and the medical community in general to profit in ways that must be curtailed. The amount of profits going to the insurance companies though is only a minor factor, it and other factors such as Tort reform can be totally eliminated from the equation and little difference occurs.

So some other dude somewhere is fat and MY cost of health care should go up because of that?
There’s nothing remotely fair, or even American, about that concept. If you feel that there is, then there is clearly a gulf between us that will not be bridged.
Simply put, it is NOT the job of government to regulate health care or any other personal service. The job of government is to provide for the national defense, provide public safety, and maintain infrastructure. The nature of the government machine means that it is simply too inefficient to handle other chores effectively.
They screwed up when they tried to run our retirement, and rather than learning from that and backing off, now they’re screwing up our health care too……

And while we’re at it, would YOU like the government coming into YOUR business and telling you what an acceptable percentage is for administrative/overhead and profits are? Because that’s exactly what they have done to insurance companies with this 80% ratio….
If you don’t see that as a rip off, and you don’t see the increased cost of health care to responsible Americans everywhere as a rip off, then your perspective is way, way off.

No Dano,
“Rip-off” implies that ‘We the People’ are deceiving ‘We the People’ with some type of malice. You simply don’t understand the concept of a republic or a democracy. You also don’t seem to understand what it means to make a supported claim. Show for example where someone in government has something to gain from ‘ripping off’ your premium dollars.
As for you paying for some other “fat” “dude”, well…that is how insurance works and there were plenty of us who wanted Single Payer but Americans seem to think that all aspects of Socialism are bad. The pool concept would still apply but then we would all be in the same pool. The truth is though, ‘insurance’ is socialism plain and simple, but when practiced as a market-driven enterprise the door is open for competition, and that leads to pooling which excludes those with high-risk factors, and as I explained above, market forces left unregulated will lead to pooling that excludes people for things like the potential for having children. Thus, without regulation, the system will surely fail. And of course history provides countless examples of unregulated markets(see:Great Depression or Somalia and etc.)and those always fail while economies with extensive regulation are now topping all the lists of nations with the highest standards of living (Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, and etc).
In any case, you and the other complainers need offer up some suggestion other than the ‘me-me-me’ argument. Health-care costs were double those of our competitors without increasing exports we can’t create enough jobs, and those costs were rising at 17% per year, what does it take for you to understand ‘unsustainable’, too expensive for the nation and not covering enough people?

So make an arguement and push for an expansion of Medicaid for anyone who wants to use it, instead of yet more Byzantine regulations that us plebeians cannot understand. I’m having a hard time seeing how this is anything but a boondoggle for insurance companies and their shareholders as it stands at the moment.

Ray, you did not explain why your hypothetical super fit risk pool with low premiums is bad. I would work even harder to get in that pool for the financial benefit, which is a positive nudge because my low risk means lowering the nations health care cost to GDP percentage you are so concerned with. You said there would be other pools with higher risk that would have to pay more, but I don’t see a problem with that. If they cannot afford the insurance to cover their higher risk, then they drop into Medicaid. It isn’t that they are left to die as one of your earlier posts disingenuously claimed. Those with poorer health would have to spend more on health. If you consider that unfair, you must also consider it unfair that those who are born dumber earn less in wages. You can’t rearrange all of life to satisfy the elusive idea of fair, if that is even an idea worth pursuing.
But now we are all in the crappy pool and paying for it. There are no disincentives for lifestyle choices that hike up medical costs, and this system did nothing to lower our super-high diagnostic costs and even higher end-of-life medical costs. Instead it exacerbates the problem by pushing the cost away from the cost creator and onto the young and healthy. This is why ACA was opposed by a strong majority of Americans. The Democrat house members didn’t care what the voters thought, which gave us the Republican house. Hell, even Massachusetts sent Scott Brown and his truck to DC to stop the madness. That is why they had to pass the flawed bill because nothing else could have gotten back through the Senate.
And we are the governed, not the government. The governed have limitless possibility to advance as a people and country, but the government keeps finding ways to get in the way of that. The current officeholders are doing such a good job of it, that you can now claim several European countries have eclipsed where America was in the American century. Very sad.

skeptical,
Almost a good comment except you just can’t quite grasp what ‘disingenuous’ means. So here is yet another example for you, when I say to Dano: “So you believe that ‘We the People’(the guv) have no right to regulate. But what about those who would suffer or die without our aid? Do we simply let them die along the road?
Then you say: ” It isn’t that they are left to die as one of your earlier posts disingenuously claimed”.
See the diff? Notice how I don’t actually say anyone is ‘left to die” but instead ask Dano if he thinks that is a viable solution.
And what makes you think that I believe that the ‘super fit pools’ are “bad”? I just happen to be very fit and I dislike paying for the poor choices of others just as much as anyone. I was simply trying to explain that our national discourse on this subject, and our aversion to Socialism, have left us with nothing but ‘lessor of two evils’ types of choices. If we follow your suggestion and simply leave all high-risk cases to pool together with subsidies and Medicaid as the payment solution it would simply drive up taxes. There would likely be some benefits from better incentives as you say but if that is the objective I suspect that something like a sin tax would work better, and I’m all for that, and, eliminating ag subsidies would drive up the costs of some unhealthful items as well(high fructose corn syrup). But we had that part of this conversation a few years ago and most Americans want to pretend that poor health is not the issue. So now some of them will learn the hard way what it means to be overweight and made to pay their share of the costs. And the healthy and fit sect will pay for something that will put a bad taste in their mouths. But then the market forces will come along and ‘super-fit’ plans will be offered. There are no regulations restricting plans that provide the very type of incentive that you allude to, and thus, the standard plans become de facto high-risk pools. I have in fact explained these dynamics many times but most folks have trouble grasping that market forces have a mind of their own. Consider for example how the food industry fought and won against GMO labeling only to open a window of opportunity for producers of Non-GMO products to label accordingly and thereby gain an advantage. Start to understand these forces and the ACA is a work of genius in its social engineering scope. Those of us who read J.K. Galbraith decades ago were privy to how market forces will incessantly require more and more regulation. His book INSTITUTIONAL CAPITALISM is on this very subject and it is a must read for anyone wanting to understand how our system must be managed. The notion that free markets will self regulate is merely fantasy for those who don’t understand the dynamics involved.
And the Europeans have always been ahead of us in the evolutionary and developmental sense, we just had some luck due to the world wars, and due to our abundance of resources.

No. 83-196
Argued February 27, 1984
Decided June 26, 1984
467 U.S. 986
Syllabus
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use data submitted by an applicant for registration of a covered product (hereinafter pesticide) in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant, and to disclose publicly some of the submitted data. Under the data-consideration provisions of § 3, as amended in 1978, applicants now are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978, while all other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter. If the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding, and if an original submitter refuses to participate in negotiations or arbitration, he forfeits his claim for compensation. Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation. Section 10, as amended in 1978, authorizes, in general, public disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data even though it may result in disclosure of trade secrets. Appellee, a company headquartered in Missouri, is an inventor, producer, and seller of pesticides, and invests substantial sums in developing active ingredients for pesticides and in producing end-use products that combine such ingredients with inert ingredients. Appellee brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging, inter alia, that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effected a "taking" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose. The District Court held that the challenged provisions of FIFRA are unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those provisions.
Page 467 U. S. 987
Held:
1. To the extent that appellee has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade secret property right under Missouri law, that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Despite their intangible nature, trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more traditional forms of property. Moreover, this Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Clause. Pp. 467 U. S. 1000-1004.
2. EPA's consideration or disclosure of data submitted by appellee prior to October 22, 1972, or after September 30, 1978, does not effect a taking, but EPA's consideration or disclosure of certain health, safety, and environmental data constituting a trade secret under state law and submitted by appellee between those two dates may constitute a taking under certain conditions. Pp. 467 U. S. 1004-1014.
(a) A factor for consideration in determining whether a governmental action short of acquisition or destruction of property has gone beyond proper "regulation" and effects a "taking" is whether the action interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations. With respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that appellee submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments (October 1, 1978), appellee could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself. As long as appellee is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking. Pp. 467 U. S. 1005-1008.
(b) Prior to its amendment in 1972 (effective October 22, 1972), FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA's authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration. Although the Trade Secrets Act provides a criminal penalty for a Government employee who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information revealed to him during the course of his official duties, it is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, appellee had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information submitted to EPA before October 22, 1972, would remain inviolate in the EPA's hands. The possibility was substantial that the Federal Government at some future time would find disclosure to be in the public interest. A fortiori, the Trade Secrets Act, which penalizes only unauthorized disclosure, cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency
Page 467 U. S. 988
use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration. Pp. 467 U. S. 1008-1010.
(c) However, under the statutory scheme in effect between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission. The explicit governmental guarantee to registration applicants of confidentiality and exclusive use with respect to trade secrets during this period formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation. If EPA, consistent with current provisions of FIFRA, were now to disclose such trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, its actions would frustrate appellee's reasonable investment-backed expectation. If, however, arbitration pursuant to FIFRA were to yield just compensation for the loss in the market value of appellee's trade secret data suffered because of EPA's consideration of the data in connection with another application (no arbitration having yet occurred), then appellee would have no claim against the Government for a taking. Pp. 467 U. S. 1010-1014.
3. Any taking of private property that may occur in connection with EPA's use of data submitted to it by appellee between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is a taking for a "public use," rather than for a "private use," even though subsequent applicants may be the most direct beneficiaries. So long as a taking has a conceivable public character, the means by which it will be attained is for Congress to determine. Congress believed that the data-consideration provisions would eliminate costly duplication of research and streamline the registration process, making new end-use products available to consumers more quickly. Such a procompetitive purpose is within Congress' police power. With regard to FIFRA's data-disclosure provisions, the optimum amount of disclosure to assure the public that a product is safe and effective is to be determined by Congress, not the courts. Pp. 467 U. S. 1014-1016.
4. A Tucker Act remedy is available to provide appellee with just compensation for any taking of property that may occur as a result of FIFRA's data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions, and thus the District Court erred in enjoining EPA from acting under those provisions. Neither FIFRA nor its legislative history discusses the interaction between FIFRA and the Tucker Act, and inferring a withdrawal of Tucker Act jurisdiction would amount to a disfavored partial repeal by implication of the Tucker Act. FIFRA's provision that an original submitter of data forfeits his right to compensation from a later submitter for the use of the original submitter's data if he fails to participate in, or comply with the terms of, a negotiated or arbitrated

compensation settlement merely requires a claimant to first seek satisfaction through FIFRA's procedure before asserting a Tucker Act claim. Pp. 467 U. S. 1016-1019.

Because the Tucker Act is available as a remedy for any uncompensated taking appellee may suffer as a result of the operation of the challenged provisions of FIFRA, appellee's challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration and compensation scheme of FIFRA are not ripe for resolution.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI
Syllabus
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use data submitted by an applicant for registration of a covered product (hereinafter pesticide) in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant, and to disclose publicly some of the submitted data. Under the data-consideration provisions of § 3, as amended in 1978, applicants now are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978, while all other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter. If the parties cannot agree on the amount of compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding, and if an original submitter refuses to participate in negotiations or arbitration, he forfeits his claim for compensation. Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation. Section 10, as amended in 1978, authorizes, in general, public disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data even though it may result in disclosure of trade secrets. Appellee, a company headquartered in Missouri, is an inventor, producer, and seller of pesticides, and invests substantial sums in developing active ingredients for pesticides and in producing end-use products that combine such ingredients with inert ingredients. Appellee brought suit in Federal District Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging, inter alia, that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effected a "taking" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose. The District Court held that the challenged provisions of FIFRA are unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those provisions.
Page 467 U. S. 987
Held:
1. To the extent that appellee has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade secret property right under Missouri law, that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Despite their intangible nature, trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more traditional forms of property. Moreover, this Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Clause. Pp. 467 U. S. 1000-1004.
2. EPA's consideration or disclosure of data submitted by appellee prior to October 22, 1972, or after September 30, 1978, does not effect a taking, but EPA's consideration or disclosure of certain health, safety, and environmental data constituting a trade secret under state law and submitted by appellee between those two dates may constitute a taking under certain conditions. Pp. 467 U. S. 1004-1014.
(a) A factor for consideration in determining whether a governmental action short of acquisition or destruction of property has gone beyond proper "regulation" and effects a "taking" is whether the action interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations. With respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that appellee submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments (October 1, 1978), appellee could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself. As long as appellee is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking. Pp. 467 U. S. 1005-1008.
(b) Prior to its amendment in 1972 (effective October 22, 1972), FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA's authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration. Although the Trade Secrets Act provides a criminal penalty for a Government employee who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information revealed to him during the course of his official duties, it is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, appellee had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information submitted to EPA before October 22, 1972, would remain inviolate in the EPA's hands. The possibility was substantial that the Federal Government at some future time would find disclosure to be in the public interest. A fortiori, the Trade Secrets Act, which penalizes only unauthorized disclosure, cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency
Page 467 U. S. 988
use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration. Pp. 467 U. S. 1008-1010.
(c) However, under the statutory scheme in effect between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission. The explicit governmental guarantee to registration applicants of confidentiality and exclusive use with respect to trade secrets during this period formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation. If EPA, consistent with current provisions of FIFRA, were now to disclose such trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, its actions would frustrate appellee's reasonable investment-backed expectation. If, however, arbitration pursuant to FIFRA were to yield just compensation for the loss in the market value of appellee's trade secret data suffered because of EPA's consideration of the data in connection with another application (no arbitration having yet occurred), then appellee would have no claim against the Government for a taking. Pp. 467 U. S. 1010-1014.
3. Any taking of private property that may occur in connection with EPA's use of data submitted to it by appellee between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is a taking for a "public use," rather than for a "private use," even though subsequent applicants may be the most direct beneficiaries. So long as a taking has a conceivable public character, the means by which it will be attained is for Congress to determine. Congress believed that the data-consideration provisions would eliminate costly duplication of research and streamline the registration process, making new end-use products available to consumers more quickly. Such a procompetitive purpose is within Congress' police power. With regard to FIFRA's data-disclosure provisions, the optimum amount of disclosure to assure the public that a product is safe and effective is to be determined by Congress, not the courts. Pp. 467 U. S. 1014-1016.
4. A Tucker Act remedy is available to provide appellee with just compensation for any taking of property that may occur as a result of FIFRA's data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions, and thus the District Court erred in enjoining EPA from acting under those provisions. Neither FIFRA nor its legislative history discusses the interaction between FIFRA and the Tucker Act, and inferring a withdrawal of Tucker Act jurisdiction would amount to a disfavored partial repeal by implication of the Tucker Act. FIFRA's provision that an original submitter of data forfeits his right to compensation from a later submitter for the use of the original submitter's data if he fails to participate in, or comply with the terms of, a negotiated or arbitrated
Page 467 U. S. 989
compensation settlement merely requires a claimant to first seek satisfaction through FIFRA's procedure before asserting a Tucker Act claim. Pp. 467 U. S. 1016-1019.
5. Because the Tucker Act is available as a remedy for any uncompensated taking appellee may suffer as a result of the operation of the challenged provisions of FIFRA, appellee's challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration and compensation scheme of FIFRA are not ripe for resolution. Pp. 467 U. S. 1019-1020.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, we are asked to review a United States District Court's determination that several provisions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 61 Stat. 163, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 136 et seq., are unconstitutional. The provisions at issue authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use data submitted by an applicant for registration of a pesticide [Footnote 1] in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant, and to disclose publicly some of the submitted data.
I
Over the past century, the use of pesticides to control weeds and minimize crop damage caused by insects, disease, and animals has become increasingly more important for American agriculture. See S.Rep. No. 95-334, p. 32 (1977); S.Rep. No. 92-838, pp. 3-4, 6-7 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 92511, pp. 3-7 (1971). While pesticide use has led to improvements in productivity, it has also led to increased risk of harm to humans and the environment. See S.Rep. No. 92-838, at 3-4, 6-7; H.R.Rep. NO. 92-511, at 3-7. Although the Federal Government has regulated pesticide use for nearly 75 years, [Footnote 2] FIFRA was first adopted in 1947. 61 Stat. 163.
Page 467 U. S. 991
As first enacted, FIFRA was primarily a licensing and labeling statute. It required that all pesticides be registered with the Secretary of Agriculture prior to their sale in interstate or foreign commerce. §§ 3(a) and 4(a) of the 1947 Act, 61 Stat. 166-167. The 1947 legislation also contained general standards setting forth the types of information necessary for proper labeling of a registered pesticide, including directions for use; warnings to prevent harm to people, animals, and plants; and claims made about the efficacy of the product. §§ 2(u)(2) and 3(a)(3).
Upon request of the Secretary, an applicant was required to submit test data supporting the claims on the label, including the formula for the pesticide. §§ 4(a) and (b). The 1947 version of FIFRA specifically prohibited disclosure of "any information relative to formulas of products," §§ 3(c)(4) and 8(c), but was silent with respect to the disclosure of any of the health and safety data submitted with an application. [Footnote 3]
In 1970, the Department of Agriculture's FIFRA responsibilities were transferred to the then newly created Environmental Protection Agency, whose Administrator is the appellant in this case. See Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, 35 Fed.Reg. 15623 (1970), 5 U.S.C.App. p. 1132.
Because of mounting public concern about the safety of pesticides and their effect on the environment, and because of a growing perception that the existing legislation was not equal to the task of safeguarding the public interest, see S.Rep. No. 92-838, at 3-9; S.Rep. No. 92-970, p. 9 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, at 5-13, Congress undertook a comprehensive revision of FIFRA through the adoption of the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 973. The amendments transformed FIFRA from a labeling law into a comprehensive regulatory statute. H.R.Rep. No. 92-511, at 1. As amended, FIFRA regulated the
Page 467 U. S. 992
use, as well as the sale and labeling, of pesticides; regulated pesticides produced and sold in both intrastate and interstate commerce; provided for review, cancellation, and suspension of registration; and gave EPA greater enforcement authority. Congress also added a new criterion for registration: that EPA determine that the pesticide will not cause "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment." §§ 3(c)(5)(C) and (D), 86 Stat. 980-981.
For purposes of this litigation, the most significant of the 1972 amendments pertained to the pesticide registration procedure and the public disclosure of information learned through that procedure. Congress added to FIFRA a new section governing public disclosure of data submitted in support of an application for registration. Under that section, the submitter of data could designate any portions of the submitted material it believed to be "trade secrets or commercial or financial information." § 10(a), 86 Stat. 989. Another section prohibited EPA from publicly disclosing information which, in its judgment, contained or related to "trade secrets or commercial or financial information." § 10(b). In the event that EPA disagreed with a submitter's designation of certain information as "trade secrets or commercial or financial information" and proposed to disclose that information, the original submitter could institute a declaratory judgment action in federal district court. § 10(c).
The 1972 amendments also included a provision that allowed EPA to consider data submitted by one applicant for registration in support of another application pertaining to a similar chemical, provided the subsequent applicant offered to compensate the applicant who originally submitted the data. § 3(c)(1)(D). In effect, the provision instituted a mandatory data-licensing scheme. The amount of compensation was to be negotiated by the parties, or, in the event negotiations failed, was to be determined by EPA, subject to judicial review upon the instigation of the original data submitter. The scope of the 1972 data-consideration provision, however,
Page 467 U. S. 993
was limited, for any data designated as "trade secrets or commercial or financial information" exempt from disclosure under § 10 could not be considered at all by EPA to support another registration application unless the original submitter consented. Ibid.
The 1972 amendments did not specify standards for the designation of submitted data as "trade secrets or commercial or financial information." In addition, Congress failed to designate an effective date for the data-consideration and disclosure schemes. In 1975, Congress amended § 3(c)(1)(D) to provide that the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions applied only to data submitted on or after January 1, 1970, 89 Stat. 755, but left the definitional question unanswered.
Much litigation centered around the definition of "trade secrets or commercial or financial information" for the purposes of the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA. EPA maintained that the exemption from consideration or disclosure applied only to a narrow range of information, principally statements of formulae and manufacturing processes. In a series of lawsuits, however, data-submitting firms challenged EPA's interpretation and obtained several decisions to the effect that the term "trade secrets" applied to any data, including health, safety, and environmental data, that met the definition of trade secrets set forth in Restatement of Torts § 757 (1939). See, e.g., Mobay Chemical Corp. v. Costle, 447 F.Supp. 811 (WD Mo.1978); Chevron Chemical Co. v. Costle, 443 F.Supp. 1024 (ND Cal.1978). These decisions prevented EPA from disclosing much of the data on which it based its decision to register pesticides and from considering the data submitted by one applicant in reviewing the application of a later applicant. See S.Rep. No. 95-334, at 7; H.R.Rep. No. 95-663, p. 18 (1977).
Because of these and other problems with the regulatory scheme embodied in FIFRA as amended in 1972, see S.Rep.
Page 467 U. S. 994
No. 95-334, at 2-5; H.R.Rep. No. 95-663, at 15-21; see generally EPA Office of Pesticide Programs, FIFRA: Impact on the Industry (1977), reprinted in S.Rep. No. 95-334, at 34-68, Congress enacted other amendments to FIFRA in 1978. These were effected by the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 819. The new amendments included a series of revisions in the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA's §§ 3 and 10, 7 U.S.C. §§ 136a and 136h. Under FIFRA, as amended in 1978, applicants are granted a 10-year period of exclusive use for data on new active ingredients contained in pesticides registered after September 30, 1978. § 3(c)(1)(D)(i). All other data submitted after December 31, 1969, may be cited and considered in support of another application for 15 years after the original submission if the applicant offers to compensate the original submitter. § 3(c)(1)(D)(ii). [Footnote 4] If the parties cannot agree on the amount of
Page 467 U. S. 995
compensation, either may initiate a binding arbitration proceeding. The results of the arbitration proceeding are not subject to judicial review, absent fraud or misrepresentation. The same statute provides that an original submitter who refuses to participate in negotiations or in the arbitration proceeding forfeits his claim for compensation. Data that do not qualify for either the 10-year period of exclusive use or the 15-year period of compensation may be considered by EPA without limitation. § 3(c)(1)(D)(iii).
Also in 1978, Congress added a new subsection, § 10(d), 7 U.S.C. § 136h(d), that provides for disclosure of all health,
Page 467 U. S. 996
safety, and environmental data to qualified requesters, notwithstanding the prohibition against disclosure of trade secrets contained in § 10(b). The provision, however, does not authorize disclosure of information that would reveal "manufacturing or quality control processes" or certain details about deliberately added inert ingredients unless
"the Administrator has first determined that the disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."
§§ 10(d)(1)(A) to (C). [Footnote 5] EPA may not disclose data to representatives of foreign or multinational pesticide companies unless the original submitter of
Page 467 U. S. 997
the data consents to the disclosure. § 10(g). Another subsection establishes a criminal penalty for wrongful disclosure by a Government employee or contractor of confidential or trade secret data. § 10(f).
II
Appellee Monsanto Company (Monsanto) is an inventor, developer, and producer of various kinds of chemical products, including pesticides. Monsanto, headquartered in St. Louis County, Mo., sells in both domestic and foreign markets. It is one of a relatively small group of companies that invent and develop new active ingredients for pesticides and conduct most of the research and testing with respect to those ingredients. [Footnote 6]
These active ingredients are sometimes referred to as "manufacturing-use products" because they are not generally sold directly to users of pesticides. Rather, they must first be combined with "inert ingredients" -- chemicals that dissolve, dilute, or stabilize the active components. The results of this process are sometimes called "end-use products," and the firms that produce end-use products are called "formulators." See the opinion of the District Court in this case, Monsanto Co. v. Acting Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 564 F.Supp. 552, 554 (ED Mo.1983). A firm that produces an active ingredient may
Page 467 U. S. 998
use it for incorporation into its own end-use products, may sell it to formulators, or may do both. Monsanto produces both active ingredients and end-use products. Ibid.
The District Court found that development of a potential commercial pesticide candidate typically requires the expenditure of $5 million to $15 million annually for several years. The development process may take between 14 and 22 years, and it is usually that long before a company can expect any return on its investment. Id. at 555. For every manufacturing-use pesticide the average company finally markets, it will have screened and tested 20,000 others. Monsanto has a significantly better-than-average success rate; it successfully markets 1 out of every 10,000 chemicals tested. Ibid.
Monsanto, like any other applicant for registration of a pesticide, must present research and test data supporting its application. The District Court found that Monsanto had incurred costs in excess of $23.6 million in developing the health, safety, and environmental data submitted by it under FIFRA. Id. at 560. The information submitted with an application usually has value to Monsanto beyond its instrumentality in gaining that particular application. Monsanto uses this information to develop additional end-use products and to expand the uses of its registered products. The information would also be valuable to Monsanto's competitors. For that reason, Monsanto has instituted stringent security measures to ensure the secrecy of the data. Ibid.
It is this health, safety, and environmental data that Monsanto sought to protect by bringing this suit. The District Court found that much of these data "contai[n] or relat[e] to trade secrets as defined by the Restatement of Torts and Confidential, commercial information." Id. at 562.
Monsanto brought suit in District Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief from the operation of the data-consideration provisions of FIFRA's § 3(c)(1)(D), and the data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA's § 10 and the related § 3(c)(2)(A). Monsanto alleged that all of the challenged provisions
Page 467 U. S. 999
effected a "taking" of property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In addition, Monsanto alleged that the data-consideration provisions violated the Amendment because they effected a taking of property for a private, rather than a public, purpose. Finally, Monsanto alleged that the arbitration scheme provided by § 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) violates the original submitter's due process rights, and constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of judicial power.
After a bench trial, the District Court concluded that Monsanto possessed property rights in its submitted data, specifically including the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of such data by preventing their unauthorized use and by prohibiting their disclosure. 564 F.Supp. at 566. The court found that the challenged data-consideration provisions "give Monsanto's competitors a free ride at Monsanto's expense." Ibid. The District Court reasoned that § 3(c)(1)(D) appropriated Monsanto's fundamental right to exclude, and that the effect of that appropriation is substantial. The court further found that Monsanto's property was being appropriated for a private purpose, and that this interference was much more significant than the public good that the appropriation might serve. 564 F.Supp. at 566-567.
The District Court also found that operation of the disclosure provisions of FIFRA constituted a taking of Monsanto's property. The cost incurred by Monsanto when its property is "permanently committed to the public domain and thus effectively destroyed" was viewed by the District Court as significantly outweighing any benefit to the general public from having the ability to scrutinize the data, for the court seemed to believe that the general public could derive all the assurance it needed about the safety and effectiveness of a pesticide from EPA's decision to register the product and to approve the label. Id. at 567, and n. 4.
After finding that the data-consideration provisions operated to effect a taking of property, the District Court found
Page 467 U. S. 1000
that the compulsory binding arbitration scheme set forth in § 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) did not adequately provide compensation for the property taken. The court found the arbitration provision to be arbitrary and vague, reasoning that the statute does not give arbitrators guidance as to the factors that enter into the concept of just compensation, and that judicial review is foreclosed except in cases of fraud. 564 F.Supp. at 567. The District Court also found that the arbitration scheme was infirm because it did not meet the requirements of Art. III of the Constitution. Ibid. Finally, the court found that a remedy under the Tucker Act was not available for the deprivations of property effected by §§ 3 and 10. 564 F.Supp. at 567-568.
The District Court therefore declared §§ 3(c)(1)(D), 3(c)(2)(A), 10(b), and 10(d) of FIFRA, as amended by the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, to be unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined EPA from implementing or enforcing those sections. See Amended Judgment, App. to Juris.Statement 41a. [Footnote 7]
We noted probable jurisdiction. 464 U.S. 890 (1983).
III
In deciding this case, we are faced with four questions: (1) Does Monsanto have a property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause in the health, safety, and environmental data it has submitted to EPA? (2) If so, does EPA's use of the data to evaluate the applications of others or EPA's disclosure of the data to qualified members of the public effect a taking of that property interest? (3) If there
Page 467 U. S. 1001
is a taking, is it a taking for a public use? (4) If there is a taking for a public use, does the statute adequately provide for just compensation?
For purposes of this case, EPA has stipulated that
"Monsanto has certain property rights in its information, research and test data that it has submitted under FIFRA to EPA and its predecessor agencies which may be protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."
App. 36. Since the exact import of that stipulation is not clear, we address the question whether the data at issue here can be considered property for the purposes of the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
This Court never has squarely addressed the applicability of the protections of the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment to commercial data of the kind involved in this case. In answering the question now, we are mindful of the basic axiom that
"'[p]roperty interests . . . are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.'"
Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U. S. 155, 449 U. S. 161 (1980), quoting Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 408 U. S. 577 (1972). Monsanto asserts that the health, safety, and environmental data it has submitted to EPA are property under Missouri law, which recognizes trade secrets, as defined in § 757, Comment b, of the Restatement of Torts, as property. See Reddi-Wip, Inc. v. Lemay Valve Co., 354 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Mo.App.1962); Harrington v. National Outdoor Advertising Co., 355 Mo. 524, 532, 196 S.W.2d 786, 791 (1946); Luckett v. Orange Julep Co., 271 Mo. 289, 302-304, 196 S.W. 740, 743 (1917). The Restatement defines a trade secret as
"any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one's business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it."
§ 757, Comment b. And the parties have stipulated that much of the information, research, and test data that Monsanto has submitted under
Page 467 U. S. 1002
FIFRA to EPA "contains or relates to trade secrets as defined by the Restatement of Torts." App. 36.
Because of the intangible nature of a trade secret, the extent of the property right therein is defined by the extent to which the owner of the secret protects his interest from disclosure to others. See Harrington, supra; Reddi-Wip, supra; Restatement of Torts, supra; see also Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U. S. 470, 416 U. S. 474-476 (1974). Information that is public knowledge or that is generally known in an industry cannot be a trade secret. Restatement of Torts, supra. If an individual discloses his trade secret to others who are under no obligation to protect the confidentiality of the information, or otherwise publicly discloses the secret, his property right is extinguished. See Harrington, supra; 1 R. Milgrim, Trade Secrets § 1.01[2] (1983).
Trade secrets have many of the characteristics of more tangible forms of property. A trade secret is assignable. See, e.g., Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373, 220 U. S. 401-402 (1911); Painton & Co. v. Bourns, Inc., 442 F.2d 216, 225 (CA2 1971). A trade secret can form the res of a trust, Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 82, Comment e (1959); 1 A. Scott, Law of Trusts § 82.5, p. 703 (3d ed.1967), and it passes to a trustee in bankruptcy. See In re Uniservices, Inc., 517 F.2d 492, 496-497 (CA7 1975).
Even the manner in which Congress referred to trade secrets in the legislative history of FIFRA supports the general perception of their property-like nature. In discussing the 1978 amendments to FIFRA, Congress recognized that data developers like Monsanto have a "proprietary interest" in their data. S.Rep. No. 95-334, at 31. Further, Congress reasoned that submitters of data are "entitled" to "compensation" because they "have legal ownership of the data." H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-1560, p. 29 (1978). [Footnote 8] This general
Page 467 U. S. 1003
perception of trade secrets as property is consonant with a notion of "property" that extends beyond land and tangible goods and includes the products of an individual's "labour and invention." 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *405; see generally J. Locke, The Second Treatise of Civil Government, ch. 5 (J. Gough ed.1947).
Although this Court never has squarely addressed the question whether a person can have a property interest in a trade secret, which is admittedly intangible, the Court has found other kinds of intangible interests to be property for purposes of the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause. See, e.g., Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 364 U. S. 44, 46 (1960) (materialman's lien provided for under Maine law protected by Taking Clause); Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555, 295 U. S. 596-602 (1935) (real estate lien protected); Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, 292 U. S. 579 (1934) (valid contracts are property within meaning of the Taking Clause). That intangible property rights protected by state law are deserving of the protection of the Taking Clause has long been implicit in the thinking of this Court:
"It is conceivable that [the term 'property' in the Taking Clause] was used in its vulgar and untechnical sense of the physical thing with respect to which the citizen exercises rights recognized by law. On the other hand, it may have been employed in a more accurate sense to denote the group of rights inhering in the citizen's relation to the physical thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of it. In point of fact, the construction given the phrase has been the latter."
United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373, 323 U. S. 377-378 (1945).
We therefore hold that, to the extent that Monsanto has an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade secret property right under Missouri law,
Page 467 U. S. 1004
that property right is protected by the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment. [Footnote 9]
IV
Having determined that Monsanto has a property interest in the data it has submitted to EPA, we confront the difficult question whether a "taking" will occur when EPA discloses those data or considers the data in evaluating another application for registration. The question of what constitutes a "taking" is one with which this Court has wrestled on many occasions. It has never been the rule that only governmental acquisition or destruction of the property of an individual constitutes a taking, for
"courts have held that the deprivation of the former owner, rather than the accretion of a right or interest
Page 467 U. S. 1005
to the sovereign constitutes the taking. Governmental action short of acquisition of title or occupancy has been held, if its effects are so complete as to deprive the owner of all or most of his interest in the subject matter, to amount to a taking."
United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. at 323 U. S. 378. See also PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74 (1980); Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 260 U. S. 415(1922).
As has been admitted on numerous occasions,
"this Court has generally "been unable to develop any set formula' for determining when `justice and fairness' require that economic injuries caused by public action""
must be deemed a compensable taking. Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164, 444 U. S. 175 (1979), quoting Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 438 U. S. 124 (1978); accord, Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 452 U. S. 295 (1981). The inquiry into whether a taking has occurred is essentially an "ad hoc, factual" inquiry. Kaiser-Aetna, 444 U.S. at 444 U. S. 175. The Court, however, has identified several factors that should be taken into account when determining whether a governmental action has gone beyond "regulation" and effects a "taking." Among those factors are:
"the character of the governmental action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations."
PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. at 447 U. S. 83; see Kaiser-Aetna, 444 U.S. at 444 U. S. 175; Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 438 U. S. 124. It is to the last of these three factors that we now direct our attention, for we find that the force of this factor is so overwhelming, at least with respect to certain of the data submitted by Monsanto to EPA, that it disposes of the taking question regarding those data.
A
A "reasonable investment-backed expectation" must be more than a "unilateral expectation or an abstract need."
Page 467 U. S. 1006
Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, 449 U.S. at 449 U. S. 161. We find that, with respect to any health, safety, and environmental data that Monsanto submitted to EPA after the effective date of the 1978 FIFRA amendments -- that is, on or after October 1, 1978 [Footnote 10] -- Monsanto could not have had a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that EPA would keep the data confidential beyond the limits prescribed in the amended statute itself. Monsanto was on notice of the manner in which EPA was authorized to use and disclose any data turned over to it by an applicant for registration.
Thus, with respect to any data submitted to EPA on or after October 1, 1978, Monsanto knew that, for a period of 10 years from the date of submission, EPA would not consider those data in evaluating the application of another without Monsanto's permission. § 3(c)(1)(D)(i). It was also aware, however, that, once the 10-year period had expired, EPA could use the data without Monsanto's permission. §§ 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) and (iii). Monsanto was further aware that it was entitled to an offer of compensation from the subsequent applicant only until the end of the 15th year from the date of submission. § 3(c)(1)(D)(iii). In addition, Monsanto was aware that information relating to formulae of products could be revealed by EPA to "any Federal agency consulted and [could] be revealed at a public hearing or in findings of fact" issued by EPA "when necessary to carry out" EPA's duties under FIFRA. § 10(b). The statute also gave Monsanto notice that much of the health, safety, and efficacy data provided by it could be disclosed to the general public at any time. § 10(d). If, despite the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions in the statute, Monsanto chose to submit the requisite data in order to receive a registration, it can hardly argue that its reasonable investment-
Page 467 U. S. 1007
backed expectations are disturbed when EPA acts to use or disclose the data in a manner that was authorized by law at the time of the submission.
Monsanto argues that the statute's requirement that a submitter give up its property interest in the data constitutes placing an unconstitutional condition on the right to a valuable Government benefit. See Brief for Appellee 29. But Monsanto has not challenged the ability of the Federal Government to regulate the marketing and use of pesticides. Nor could Monsanto successfully make such a challenge, for such restrictions are the burdens we all must bear in exchange for "the advantage of living and doing business in a civiized community.'" Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51, 444 U. S. 67 (1979), quoting Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. at 260 U. S. 422 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); see Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri, 342 U. S. 421, 342 U. S. 424 (1952). This is particularly true in an area, such as pesticide sale and use, that has long been the source of public concern and the subject of government regulation. That Monsanto is willing to bear this burden in exchange for the ability to market pesticides in this country is evidenced by the fact that it has continued to expand its research and development and to submit data to EPA despite the enactment of the 1978 amendments to FIFRA. [Footnote 11] 564 F.Supp. at 561.
Thus, as long as Monsanto is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data by an applicant in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking. See Corn Products Re.fining Co. v. Eddy, 249 U.S.
Page 467 U. S. 1008
427, 249 U. S. 431-432 (1919) ("The right of a manufacturer to maintain secrecy as to his compounds and processes must be held subject to the right of the State, in the exercise of its police power and in promotion of fair dealing, to require that the nature of the product be fairly set forth"); see also Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United States Nuclear Reglatory Comm'n, 555 F.2d 82, 95 (CA3 1977).
B
Prior to the 1972 amendments, FIFRA was silent with respect to EPA's authorized use and disclosure of data submitted to it in connection with an application for registration. Another statute, the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1905, however, arguably is relevant. That Act is a general criminal statute that provides a penalty for any employee of the United States Government who discloses, in a manner not authorized by law, any trade secret information that is revealed to him during the course of his official duties. This Court has determined that § 1905 is more than an "anti-leak" statute aimed at deterring Government employees from profiting by information they receive in their official capacities. See Chrysler Corp. v. Brow, 441 U. S. 281, 441 U. S. 298-301 (1979). Rather, § 1905 also applies to formal agency action, i.e., action approved by the agency or department head. Ibid.
It is true that, prior to the 1972 amendments, neither FIFRA nor any other provision of law gave EPA authority to disclose data obtained from Monsanto. But the Trade Secrets Act is not a guarantee of confidentiality to submitters of data, and, absent an express promise, Monsanto had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its information would remain inviolate in the hands of EPA. In an industry that long has been the focus of great public concern and significant government regulation, the possibility was substantial that the Federal Government, which had thus far taken no position on disclosure of health, safety, and environmental data concerning pesticides, upon focusing on the issue, would
Page 467 U. S. 1009
find disclosure to be in the public interest. Thus, with respect to data submitted to EPA in connection with an application for registration prior to October 22, 1972, [Footnote 12] the Trade Secrets Act provided no basis for a reasonable investment-backed expectation that data submitted to EPA would remain confidential.
A fortiori, the Trade Secrets Act cannot be construed as any sort of assurance against internal agency use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration. [Footnote 13] Indeed, there is some evidence that the practice of using data submitted by one company during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant was widespread and well known. [Footnote 14] Thus,
Page 467 U. S. 1010
with respect to any data that Monsanto submitted to EPA prior to the effective date of the 1972 amendments to FIFRA, we hold that Monsanto could not have had a "reasonable investment-backed expectation" that EPA would maintain those data in strictest confidence and would use them exclusively for the purpose of considering the Monsanto application in connection with which the data were submitted.
C
The situation may be different, however, with respect to data submitted by Monsanto to EPA during the period from October 22, 1972, through September 30, 1978. Under the statutory scheme then in effect, a submitter was given an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets at the time of submission. When Monsanto provided data to EPA during this period, it was with the understanding, embodied in FIFRA, that EPA was free to use any of the submitted data that were not trade secrets in considering the application of another, provided
Page 467 U. S. 1011
that EPA required the subsequent applicant to pay "reasonable compensation" to the original submitter. § 3(c)(1)(D), 86 Stat. 979. But the statute also gave Monsanto explicit assurance that EPA was prohibited from disclosing publicly, or considering in connection with the application of another, any data submitted by an applicant if both the applicant and EPA determined the data to constitute trade secrets. § 10, 86 Stat. 989. Thus, with respect to trade secrets submitted under the statutory regime in force between the time of the adoption of the 1972 amendments and the adoption of the 1978 amendments, the Federal Government had explicitly guaranteed to Monsanto and other registration applicants an extensive measure of confidentiality and exclusive use. This explicit governmental guarantee formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation. If EPA, consistent with the authority granted it by the 1978 FIFRA amendments, were now to disclose trade secret data or consider those data in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant in a manner not authorized by the version of FIFRA in effect between 1972 and 1978, EPA's actions would frustrate Monsanto's reasonable investment-backed expectation with respect to its control over the use and dissemination of the data it had submitted.
The right to exclude others is generally "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property." Kaiser-Aetna, 444 U.S. at 444 U. S. 176. With respect to a trade secret, the right to exclude others is central to the very definition of the property interest. Once the data that constitute a trade secret are disclosed to others, or others are allowed to use those data, the holder of the trade secret has lost his property interest in the data. [Footnote 15]
Page 467 U. S. 1012
That the data retain usefulness for Monsanto even after they are disclosed -- for example, as bases from which to develop new products or refine old products, as marketing and advertising tools, or as information necessary to obtain registration in foreign countries -- is irrelevant to the determination of the economic impact of the EPA action on Monsanto's property right. The economic value of that property right lies in the competitive advantage over others that Monsanto enjoys by virtue of its exclusive access to the data, and disclosure or use by others of the data would destroy that competitive edge.
EPA encourages us to view the situation not as a taking of Monsanto's property interest in the trade secrets, but as a "preemption" of whatever property rights Monsanto may have had in those trade secrets. Brief for Appellant 27-28. The agency argues that the proper functioning of the comprehensive FIFRA registration scheme depends upon its uniform application to all data. Thus, it is said, the Supremacy Clause dictates that the scheme not vary depending on the property law of the State in which the submitter is located. Id. at 28. This argument proves too much. If Congress can "preempt" state property law in the manner advocated by EPA, then the Taking Clause has lost all vitality. This Court has stated that a sovereign,
"by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation. . . . This is the very kind of thing that the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment was meant to prevent."
Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. at 449 U. S. 164.
Page 467 U. S. 1013
If a negotiation or arbitration pursuant to § 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) were to yield just compensation to Monsanto for the loss in the market value of its trade secret data suffered because of EPA's consideration of the data in connection with another application, then Monsanto would have no claim against the Government for a taking. Since no arbitration has yet occurred with respect to any use of Monsanto's data, any finding that there has been an actual taking would be premature. See infra at 467 U. S. 1O19-1020. [Footnote 16]
In summary, we hold that EPA's consideration or disclosure of data submitted by Monsanto to the agency prior to October 22, 1972, or after September 30, 1978, does not effect a taking. We further hold that EPA consideration or disclosure of health, safety, and environmental data will constitute a taking if Monsanto submitted the data to EPA between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978; [Footnote 17] the data constituted trade secrets under Missouri law; Monsanto had designated the data as trade secrets at the time of its submission; the use or disclosure conflicts with the explicit assurance of confidentiality or exclusive use contained in the statute during that period; and the operation of the arbitration provision
Page 467 U. S. 1014
does not adequately compensate for the loss in market value of the data that Monsanto suffers because of EPA's use or disclosure of the trade secrets.
V
We must next consider whether any taking of private property that may occur by operation of the data-disclosure and data-consideration provisions of FIFRA is a taking for a "public use." We have recently stated that the scope of the "public use" requirement of the Taking Clause is "coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers." Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, ante at 467 U. S. 240; see Berman v. Parker, 348 U. S. 26, 348 U. S. 33 (1954). The role of the courts in second-guessing the legislature's judgment of what constitutes a public use is extremely narrow. Midkiff, supra; Berman, supra, at 348 U. S. 32.
The District Court found that EPA's action pursuant to the data-consideration provisions of FIFRA would effect a taking for a private use, rather than a public use, because such action benefits subsequent applicants by forcing original submitters to share their data with later applicants. 564 F.Supp. at 566. It is true that the most direct beneficiaries of EPA actions under the data-consideration provisions of FIFRA will be the later applicants who will support their applications by citation to data submitted by Monsanto or some other original submitter. Because of the data-consideration provisions, later applicants will not have to replicate the sometimes intensive and complex research necessary to produce the requisite data. This Court, however, has rejected the notion that a use is a public use only if the property taken is put to use for the general public. Midkiff, ante at 467 U. S. 243-244; Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles, 262 U. S. 700, 262 U. S. 707 (1923); Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, 256 U. S. 155 (1921).
So long as the taking has a conceivable public character, "the means by which it will be attained is . . . for Congress to determine." Berman, 348 U.S. at 348 U. S. 33. Here, the public purpose behind the data-consideration provisions is clear from
Page 467 U. S. 1015
the legislative history. Congress believed that the provisions would eliminate costly duplication of research and streamline the registration process, making new end-use products available to consumers more quickly. Allowing applicants for registration, upon payment of compensation, to use data already accumulated by others, rather than forcing them to go through the time-consuming process of repeating the research, would eliminate a significant barrier to entry into the pesticide market, thereby allowing greater competition among producers of end-use products. S.Rep. No. 95-334, at 30-31, 40-41; 124 Cong.Rec. 29756-29757 (1978) (remarks of Sen. Leahy). Such a procompetitive purpose is well within the police power of Congress. See Midkiff, ante, at 467 U. S. 241-242. [Footnote 18]
Because the data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA provide for disclosure to the general public, the District Court did not find that those provisions constituted a taking for a private use. Instead, the court found that the data-disclosure provisions served no use. It reasoned that, because EPA, before registration, must determine that a product is safe and effective, and because the label on a pesticide, by statute, must set forth the nature, contents, and purpose of the pesticide, the label provided the public with all the assurance it needed that the product is safe and effective. 564 F.Supp. at 567, and n. 4. It is enough for us to state that the optimum amount of disclosure to the public is for Congress, not the courts, to decide, and that the statute embodies Congress'
Page 467 U. S. 1016
judgment on that question. See 123 Cong.Rec. at 25706 (remarks of Sen. Leahy). We further observe, however, that public disclosure can provide an effective check on the decisionmaking processes of EPA, and allows members of the public to determine the likelihood of individualized risks peculiar to their use of the product. See H.R.Rep. No. 95-343, p. 8 (1977) (remarks of Douglas M. Costle); S.Rep. No. 95-334, at 13.
We therefore hold that any taking of private property that may occur in connection with EPA's use or disclosure of data submitted to it by Monsanto between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is a taking for a public use.
VI
Equitable relief is not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private property for a public use, duly authorized by law, [Footnote 19] when a suit for compensation can be brought against the sovereign subsequent to the taking. Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 337 U. S. 697, n. 18 (1949). The Fifth Amendment does not require that compensation precede the taking. Hurley v. Kincaid, 285 U. S. 95, 285 U. S. 104 (1932). Generally, an individual claiming that the United States has taken his property can seek just compensation under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491. [Footnote 20] United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 328 U. S. 267 (1946) ("If there is a taking, the claim is founded upon the Constitution' and within the jurisdiction
Page 467 U. S. 1017
of the Court of Claims to hear and determine"); Yearsley v. Ross Construction Co., 309 U. S. 18, 309 U. S. 21 (1940).
In this case, however, the District Court enjoined EPA action under the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA, finding that a Tucker Act remedy is not available for any taking of property that may occur as a result of the operation of those provisions. We do not agree with the District Court's assessment that no Tucker Act remedy will lie for whatever taking may occur due to EPA activity pursuant to FIFRA.
In determining whether a Tucker Act remedy is available for claims arising out of a taking pursuant to a federal statute, the proper inquiry is not whether the statute "expresses an affirmative showing of congressional intent to permit recourse to a Tucker Act remedy," but
"whether Congress has, in the [statute,] withdrawn the Tucker Act grant of jurisdiction to the Court of Claims to hear a suit involving the [statute] 'founded . . . upon the Constitution.'"
Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 419 U. S. 126 (1974) (emphasis in original).
Nowhere in FIFRA or in its legislative history is there discussion of the interaction between FIFRA and the Tucker Act. Since the Tucker Act grants what is now the Claims Court "jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded . . . upon the Constitution," we would have to infer a withdrawal of jurisdiction with respect to takings under FIFRA from the structure of the statute or from its legislative history. A withdrawal of jurisdiction would amount to a partial repeal of the Tucker Act. This Court has recognized, however, that "repeals by implication are disfavored." Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 133. See, e.g., Amell v. United States, 384 U. S. 158, 384 U. S. 165-166 (1966); Mercantile National Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555, 371 U. S. 565 (1963); United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S. 188, 308 U. S. 198-199 (1939).
Page 467 U. S. 1018
Monsanto argues that FIFRA's provision that an original submitter of data who fails to participate in a procedure for reaching an agreement or in an arbitration proceeding, or fails to comply with the terms of an agreement or arbitration decision, "shall forfeit the right to compensation for the use of the data in support of the application," § 3(c)(1)(D)(ii), indicates Congress' intent that there be no Tucker Act remedy. But where two statutes are
"'capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.'"
Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 133-134, quoting Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 417 U. S. 551 (1974). Here, contrary to Monsanto's claim, it is entirely possible for the Tucker Act and FIFRA to co-exist. The better interpretation, therefore, of the FIFRA language on forfeiture, which gives force to both the Tucker Act and the FIFRA provision, is to read FIFRA as implementing an exhaustion requirement as a precondition to a Tucker Act claim. That is, FIFRA does not withdraw the possibility of a Tucker Act remedy, but merely requires that a claimant first seek satisfaction through the statutory procedure. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 154-156 (viewing Tucker Act remedy as covering any shortfall between statutory remedy and just compensation). [Footnote 21]
With respect to data disclosure to the general public, FIFRA provides for no compensation whatsoever. Thus, Monsanto's argument that Congress intended the compensation scheme provided in FIFRA to be exclusive has no relevance to the data-disclosure provisions of § 10.
Congress in FIFRA did not address the liability of the Government to pay just compensation should a taking occur. Congress' failure specifically to mention or provide for recourse
Page 467 U. S. 1019
against the Government may reflect a congressional belief that use of data by EPA in the ways authorized by FIFRA effects no Fifth Amendment taking, or it may reflect Congress' assumption that the general grant of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act would provide the necessary remedy for any taking that may occur. In any event, the failure cannot be construed to reflect an unambiguous intention to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy. "[W]hether or not the United States so intended," any taking claim under FIFRA is one "founded . . . upon the Constitution," and is thus remediable under the Tucker Act. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 126. Therefore, where the operation of the data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions of FIFRA effect a taking of property belonging to Monsanto, an adequate remedy for the taking exists under the Tucker Act. The District Court erred in enjoining the taking.
VII
Because we hold that the Tucker Act is available as a remedy for any uncompensated taking Monsanto may suffer as a result of the operation of the challenged provisions of FIFRA, we conclude that Monsanto's challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration and compensation scheme are not ripe for our resolution. Because of the availability of the Tucker Act, Monsanto's ability to obtain just compensation does not depend solely on the validity of the statutory compensation scheme. The operation of the arbitration procedure affects only Monsanto's ability to vindicate its statutory right to obtain compensation from a subsequent applicant whose registration application relies on data originally submitted by Monsanto, not its ability to vindicate its constitutional right to just compensation.
Monsanto did not allege or establish that it had been injured by actual arbitration under the statute. While the District Court acknowledged that Monsanto had received several offers of compensation from applicants for registration, 564 F.Supp. at 561, it did not find that EPA had considered
Page 467 U. S. 1020
Monsanto's data in considering another application. Further, Monsanto and any subsequent applicant may negotiate and reach agreement concerning an outstanding offer. If they do not reach agreement, then the controversy must go to arbitration. Only after EPA has considered data submitted by Monsanto in evaluating another application and an arbitrator has made an award will Monsanto's claims with respect to the constitutionality of the arbitration scheme become ripe. See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 U. S. 59, 438 U. S. 81 (1978); Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. at 419 U. S. 138.
VIII
We find no constitutional infirmity in the challenged provisions of FIFRA. Operation of the provisions may effect a taking with respect to certain health, safety, and environmental data constituting trade secrets under state law and designated by Monsanto as trade secrets upon submission to EPA between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978. [Footnote 22] But whatever taking may occur is one for a public use, and a Tucker Act remedy is available to provide Monsanto with just compensation. Once a taking has occurred, the proper forum for Monsanto's claim is the Claims Court. Monsanto's challenges to the constitutionality of the arbitration procedure are not yet ripe for review. The judgment of the District Court is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

[Footnote 1]
For purposes of our discussion of FIFRA, the term "pesticides" includes herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, and plant regulators. See §§ 2(t) and (u) of FIFRA, as amended, 7 U.S.C. §§ 136(t) and (u).
[Footnote 2]
The first federal legislation in this area was the Insecticide Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 331, which made it unlawful to manufacture and sell insecticides that were adulterated or misbranded. In 1947, the 1910 legislation was repealed and replaced with FIFRA. 61 Stat. 172.
Some States had undertaken to regulate pesticide use before there was federal legislation, and many more continued to do so after federal legislation was enacted. In 1946, the Council of State Governments recommended for adoption a model state statute, the Uniform State Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. See S.Rep. No. 92-838, p. 7 (1972); H.R.Rep. No. 313, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1947).

"(i) With respect to pesticides containing active ingredients that are initially registered under this Act after [September 30, 1978], data submitted to support the application for the original registration of the pesticide, or an application for an amendment adding any new use to the registration and that pertains solely to such new use, shall not, without the written permission of the original data submitter, be considered by the Administrator to support an application by another person during a period of ten years following the date the Administrator first registers the pesticide . . . ;"
"(ii) except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (D)(i) of this paragraph, with respect to data submitted after December 31, 1969, by an applicant or registrant to support an application for registration, experimental use permit, or amendment adding a new use to an existing registration, to support or maintain in effect an existing registration, or for reregistration, the Administrator may, without the permission of the original data submitter, consider any such item of data in support of an application by any other person . . . within the fifteen-year period following the date the data were originally submitted only if the applicant has made an offer to compensate the original data submitter and submitted such offer to the Administrator accompanied by evidence of delivery to the original data submitter of the offer. The terms and amount of compensation may be fixed by agreement between the original data submitter and the applicant, or, failing such agreement, binding arbitration under this subparagraph. If, at the end of ninety days after the date of delivery to the original data submitter of the offer to compensate, the original data submitter and the applicant have neither agreed on the amount and terms of compensation nor on a procedure for reaching an agreement on the amount and terms of compensation, either person may initiate binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service. . . . [T]he findings and determination of the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive, and no official or court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such findings and determination, except for fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct by one of the parties to the arbitration or the arbitrator where there is a verified complaint with supporting affidavits attesting to specific instances of such fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct. . . . If the Administrator determines that an original data submitter has failed to participate in a procedure for reaching an agreement or in an arbitration proceeding as required by this subparagraph, or failed to comply with the terms of an agreement or arbitration decision concerning compensation under this subparagraph, the original data submitter shall forfeit the right to compensation for the use of the data in support of the application. . . . Registration action by the Administrator shall not be delayed pending the fixing of compensation;"
"(iii) after expiration of any period of exclusive use and any period for which compensation is required for the use of an item of data under subparagraphs (D)(i) and (D)(ii) of this paragraph, the Administrator may consider such item of data in support of an application by any other applicant without the permission of the original data submitter and without an offer having been received to compensate the original data submitter for the use of such item of data."
[Footnote 5]
Section 10(d), 92 Stat. 830, reads in relevant part:
"(1) All information concerning the objectives, methodology, results, or significance of any test or experiment performed on or with a registered or previously registered pesticide or its separate ingredients, impurities, or degradation products and any information concerning the effects of such pesticide on any organism or the behavior of such pesticide in the environment, including, but not limited to, data on safety to fish and wildlife, humans, and other mammals, plants, animals, and soil, and studies on persistence, translocation and fate in the environment, and metabolism, shall be available for disclosure to the public: Provided, That the use of such data for any registration purpose shall be governed by section 3 of this Act: Provided further, That this paragraph does not authorize the disclosure of any information that -- "
"(A) discloses manufacturing or quality control processes,"
"(B) discloses the details of any methods for testing, detecting, or measuring the quantity of any deliberately added inert ingredients of a pesticide, or"
"(C) discloses the identity or percentage quantity of any deliberately added inert ingredient of a pesticide,"
unless the Administrator has first determined that disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
"(2) Information concerning production, distribution, sale, or inventories of a pesticide that is otherwise entitled to confidential treatment under subsection (b) of this section may be publicly disclosed in connection with a public proceeding to determine whether a pesticide, or any ingredient of a pesticide, causes unreasonable adverse effects on health or the environment, if the Administrator determines that such disclosure is necessary in the public interest."
[Footnote 6]
A study by the Office of Pesticide Programs of the EPA showed that, in 1977, approximately 400 firms were registered to produce manufacturinguse products. S.Rep. No. 95-334, p. 34 (1977). It was estimated that the 10 largest firms account for 75% of this country's pesticide production. Id. at 60. A correspondingly small number of new pesticides are marketed each year. In 1974, only 10 new pesticides were introduced. See Goring, The Costs of Commercializing Pesticides, International Conference of Entomology, Aug. 20, 1976, reprinted in Hearings on Extension of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act before the Subcommittee on Agricultural Research and General Legislation of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 250, 254 (1977).
[Footnote 7]
The District Court's judgment in this case is in conflict with the holdings of other federal courts. See, e.g., PetroCite Corp. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, 519 F.Supp. 966 (DC 1981); Mobay Chemical Corp. v. Costle, 517 F.Supp. 252, and 517 F.Supp. 254 (WD Pa.1981), aff'd sub nom. Mobay Chemical Co. v. Gorsuch, 682 F.2d 419 (CA3), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 988 (1982); Chevron Chemical Co. v. Costle, 499 F.Supp. 732 (Del.1980), aff'd, 641 F.2d 104 (CA3), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 961 (1981).
[Footnote 8]
Of course, it was not necessary that Congress recognize the data at issue here as property in order for the data to be protected by the Taking Clause. We mention the legislative history merely as one more illustration of the general perception of the property-like nature of trade secrets.
[Footnote 9]
Contrary to EPA's contention, Brief for Appellant 29, Justice Holmes' dictum in E. I. du Pont de Nemours Powder Co. v. Masland, 244 U. S. 100 (1917), does not undermine our holding that a trade secret is property protected by the Fifth Amendment Taking Clause. Masland arose from a dispute about the disclosure of trade secrets during preparation for a trial. In his opinion for the Court, the Justice stated:
"The case has been considered as presenting a conflict between a right of property and a right to make a full defence, and it is said that, if the disclosure is forbidden to one who denies that there is a trade secret, the merits of his defence are adjudged against him before he has a chance to be heard or to prove his case. We approach the question somewhat differently. The word property, as applied to trademarks and trade secrets, is an unanalyzed expression of certain secondary consequences of the primary fact that the law makes some rudimentary requirements of good faith. Whether the plaintiffs have any valuable secret or not, the defendant knows the facts, whatever they are, through a special confidence that he accepted. The property may be denied, but the confidence cannot be. Therefore the starting point for the present matter is not property or due process of law, but that the defendant stood in confidential relations with the plaintiffs."
Id. at 244 U. S. 102. Justice Holmes did not deny the existence of a property interest; he simply deemed determination of the existence of that interest irrelevant to resolution of the case. In a case decided prior to Masland, the Court had spoken of trade secrets in property terms. Board of Trade v. Christie Grail & Stock Co., 198 U. S. 236, 198 U. S. 250-253 (1905) (Holmes, J., for the Court). See generally 1 R. Milgrim, Trade Secrets § 1.01[1] (1983).
[Footnote 10]
The Federal Pesticide Act of 1978 was approved on September 30, 1978. 92 Stat. 842. The new data-consideration and data-disclosure provisions applied with full force to all data submitted after that date.
[Footnote 11]
Because the market for Monsanto's pesticide products is an international one, Monsanto could decide to forgo registration in the United States and sell a pesticide only in foreign markets. Presumably, it will do so in those situations where it deems the data to be protected from disclosure more valuable than the right to sell in the United States.
[Footnote 12]
The 1972 amendments to FIFRA became effective at the close of the business day on October 21, 1972. 86 Stat. 998.
[Footnote 13]
The Trade Secrets Act prohibits a Government employee from "publish[ing], divulg[ing], disclos[ing] or mak[ing] known" confidential information received in his official capacity. 18 U.S.C. § 1905. In considering the data of one applicant in connection with the application of another, EPA does not violate any of these prohibitions.
[Footnote 14]
The District Court found:
"During the period that USDA administered FIFRA, it was also its policy that the data developed and submitted by companies such as [Monsanto] could not be used to support the registration of another's product without the permission of the data submitter."
Monsanto Co. v. Acting Administrator, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 564 F.Supp. 552, 564 (ED Mo.1983) (emphasis in original). The District Court apparently based this finding on the testimony of two former Directors of the Pesticide Regulation Division, who testified that they knew of no instance in which data submitted by one applicant were subsequently considered in evaluating another application. Ibid.
This finding is in marked conflict with the statement of the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, presented before a Senate Subcommittee in 1972, which advocated that the 1972 amendments to FIFRA should contain an exclusive-use provision:
"Under the present law, registration information submitted to the Administrator has not routinely been made available for public inspection. Such information has, however, as a matter of practice but without statutory authority, been considered by the Administrator to support the registration of the same or a similar product by another registrant."
Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Agricultural Research and General Legislation of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 245 (1972). In addition, EPA points to the Department of Agriculture's Interpretation with Respect to Warning, Caution and Antidote Statements Required to Appear on Labels of Economic Poisons, 27 Fed.Reg. 2267 (1962), which presents a list of pesticides that would require no additional toxicological data for registration. The clear implication from the Interpretation is that the Department determined that the data already submitted with respect to those chemicals would be sufficient for purposes of evaluating any future applications for registration of those chemicals.
Although the evidence against the District Court's finding seems overwhelming, we need not determine that the finding was clearly erroneous in order to find that a submitter had no reasonable expectation that the Department or EPA would not use the data it had submitted when evaluating the application of another. The District Court did not find that the policy of the Department was publicly known at the time, or that there was any explicit guarantee of exclusive use.
[Footnote 15]
We emphasize that the value of a trade secret lies in the competitive advantage it gives its owner over competitors. Thus, it is the fact that operation of the data-consideration or data-disclosure provisions will allow a competitor to register more easily its product or to use the disclosed data to improve its own technology that may constitute a taking. If, however, a public disclosure of data reveals, for example, the harmful side effects of the submitter's product and causes the submitter to suffer a decline in the potential profits from sales of the product, that decline in profits stems from a decrease in the value of the pesticide to consumers, rather than from the destruction of an edge the submitter had over its competitors, and cannot constitute the taking of a trade secret.
[Footnote 16]
Because the record contains no findings with respect to the value of the trade secret data at issue, and because no arbitration proceeding has yet been held to detemine the amount of recovery to be paid by a subsequent applicant to Monsanto, we cannot preclude the possibility that the arbitration award will be sufficient to provide Monsanto with just compensation, thus nullifying any claim against the Government for a taking when EPA uses Monsanto's data in considering another application. The statutory arbitration scheme, of course, provides for compensation only in cases where the data are considered in connection with a subsequent application, not in cases of disclosure of the data.
[Footnote 17]
While the 1975 amendments to FIFRA purported to carry backward the protections against data consideration and data disclosure to submissions of data made on or after January 1, 1970, 89 Stat. 751, the relevant consideration for our purposes is the nature of the expectations of the submitter at the time the data were submitted. We therefore do not extend our ruling as to a possible taking to data submitted prior to October 22, 1972.
[Footnote 18]
Monsanto argues that EPA and, by implication, Congress misapprehended the true "barriers to entry" in the pesticide industry, and that the challenged provisions of the law create, rather than reduce, barriers to entry. Brief for Appellee 35, n. 48. Such economic arguments are better directed to Congress. The proper inquiry before this Court is not whether the provisions in fact will accomplish their stated objectives. Our review is limited to determining that the purpose is legitimate and that Congress rationally could have believed that the provisions would promote that objective. Midkiff, ante at 467 U. S. 242-243; Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 451 U. S. 648, 451 U. S. 671-672 (1981).
[Footnote 19]
Any taking of private property that would occur as a result of EPA disclosure or consideration of data submitted by Monsanto between October 22, 1972, and September 30, 1978, is, of course, duly authorized by FIFRA as amended in 1978.
[Footnote 20]
The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, reads, in relevant part:
"The United States Claims Court shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort."
[Footnote 21]
Exhaustion of the statutory remedy is necessary to determine the extent of the taking that has occurred. To the extent that the operation of the statute provides compensation, no taking has occurred and the original submitter of data has no claim against the Government.
[Footnote 22]
We emphasize that nothing in our opinion prohibits EPA's consideration or disclosure, in a manner authorized by FIFRA, of data submitted to it by Monsanto. Our decision merely holds that, with respect to a certain limited class of data submitted by Monsanto to EPA, EPA actions under the data-disclosure and data-consideration provisions of the statute may give Monsanto a claim for just compensation.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I join all of the Court's opinion except for Part 467 U. S. ante at 467 U. S. 1013, that "EPA's consideration or disclosure of data submitted by Monsanto to the agency prior to October 22, 1972, . . . does not effect a taking." In my view, public disclosure of pre-1972 data would effect a taking. As to consideration of this information within EPA in connection with other license applications not submitted by Monsanto, I believe we should remand to the District Court for further factual findings concerning Monsanto's expectations regarding interagency uses of trade secret infol mation prior to 1972.
It is important to distinguish at the outset public disclosure of trade secrets from use of those secrets entirely within EPA. Internal use may undermine Monsanto's competitive position within the United States, but it leaves Monsanto's position in foreign markets undisturbed. As the Court notes, ante at 467 U. S. 1007, n. 11, the likely impact on foreign market position is one that Monsanto would weigh when deciding whether to submit trade secrets to EPA. Thus, a submission of trade secrets to EPA that implicitly consented to further use of the information within the agency is not necessarily the same as one that implicitly consented to public disclosure.
It seems quite clear -- indeed, the Court scarcely disputes -- that public disclosure of trade secrets submitted to the Federal Government before 1972 was neither permitted by law, nor customary agency practice before 1972, nor expected by applicants for pesticide registrations. The Court correctly notes that the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1905, flatly proscribed such disclosures. The District Court expressly found that, until 1970, it was Government
"policy that the data developed and submitted by companies such as [Monsanto] be maintained confidentially by the [administrative agency], and was not to be disclosed without the permission of the data submitter."
Molsanto Co. v. Acting Administrator, EPA, 564 F.Supp. 552, 564 (1983). Finally, the Court, ante at
Page 467 U. S. 1022
467 U. S. 1009, n. 14, quotes from a 1972 statement by the National Agricultural Chemicals Association that "registration information submitted to the Administrator has not routinely been made available for public inspection." It is hard to imagine how a pre-1972 applicant for a pesticide license would not, under these circumstances, have formed a very firm expectation that its trade secrets submitted in connection with a pesticide registration would not be disclosed to the public.
The Court's analysis of this question appears in a single sentence: an "industry that long has been the focus of great public concern and significant government regulation" can have no reasonable expectation that the Government will not later find public disclosure of trade secrets to be in the public interest. Ante at 467 U. S. 1008. I am frankly puzzled to read this statement in the broader context of the Court's otherwise convincing opinion. If the degree of Government regulation determines the reasonableness of an expectation of confidentiality, Monsanto had as little reason to expect confidentiality after 1972 as before, since the 1972 amendments were not deregulatory in intent or effect. And the Court entirely fails to explain why the nondisclosure provision of the 1972 Act, § 10, 86 Stat. 989, created any greater expectation of confidentiality than the Trade Secrets Act. Section 10 prohibited EPA from disclosing "trade secrets or commercial or financial information." No penalty for disclosure was prescribed, unless disclosure was with the intent to defraud. The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1905, prohibited and still prohibits Government disclosure of trade secrets and other commercial or financial information revealed during the course of official duties, on pain of substantial criminal sanctions. The Court acknowledges that this prohibition has always extended to formal and official agency action. Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U. S. 281, 441 U. S. 298-301 (1979). It seems to me that the criminal sanctions in the Trade Secrets Act therefore created at least as strong an expectation of privacy before 1972 as the precatory language of § 10 created after 1972.
Page 467 U. S. 1023
The Court's tacit analysis seems to be this: an expectation of confidentiality can be grounded only on a statutory nondisclosure provision situated in close physical proximity, in the pages of the United States Code, to the provisions pursuant to which information is submitted to the Government. For my part, I see no reason why Congress should not be able to give effective protection to all trade secrets submitted to the Federal Government by means of a single, overarching, trade secrets provision. We routinely assume that wrongdoers are put on notice of the entire contents of the Code, though in all likelihood most of them have never owned a copy or opened a single page of it. It seems strange to assume, on the other hand, that a company like Monsanto, well served by lawyers who undoubtedly do read the Code, could build an expectation of privacy in pesticide trade secrets only if the assurance of confidentiality appeared in Title 7 itself.
The question of interagency use of trade secrets before 1972 is more difficult, because the Trade Secrets Act most likely does not extend to such uses. The District Court found that, prior to October 1972, only two competitors' registrations were granted on the basis of data submitted by Monsanto, and that Monsanto had no knowledge of either of these registrations prior to their being granted. 564 F.Supp. at 564. The District Court also found that, before 1970, it was agency policy
"that the data developed and submitted by companies such as [Monsanto] could not be used to support the registration of another's product without the permission of the data submitter."
Ibid. This Court, however, concludes on the basis of two cited fragments of evidence that "the evidence against the District Court's finding seems overwhelming." Ante at 467 U. S. 1010, n. 14. The Court nevertheless wisely declines to label the District Court's findings of fact on this matter clearly erroneous. Instead, the Court notes that the
"District Court did not find that the policy of the Department [of Agriculture] was publicly known at the time [before 1970,] or that there was any explicit guarantee of exclusive use."
Ibid. This begs exactly the right question, but the
Page 467 U. S. 1024
Court firmly declines to answer it. The Court simply states that
"there is some evidence that the practice of using data submitted by one company during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant was widespread and well known."
Ante at 467 U. S. 1009 (footnote omitted). And then, without more ado, the Court declares that, with respect to pre-1972 data, Monsanto
"could not have had a 'reasonable investment-backed expectation' that EPA would . . . use [the data] exclusively for the purpose of considering the Monsanto application in connection with which the data were submitted."
Ante at 467 U. S. 1010.
If one thing is quite clear, it is that the extent of Monsanto's pre-1972 expectations, whether reasonable and investment-backed or otherwise, is a heavily factual question. It is fairly clear that the District Court found that those expectations existed as a matter of fact, and were reasonable as a matter of law. But if the factual findings of the District Court on this precise question were not as explicit as they might have been, the appropriate disposition is to remand to the District Court for further factfinding. That is the course I would follow with respect to interagency use of trade secrets submitted by Monsanto before 1972.

Regulation Information
The CDX registration site supports the requirements and procedures set forth under the EPA's proposed Cross-Media Electronic Reporting Regulation. The following language about registering for Central Data Exchange comes from Part D (i.e. "Submitter registration process") of the Section 3.2000 (i.e. "What are the criteria for acceptable electronic document receiving systems?"):
An acceptable electronic document receiving system must require that anyone who submits an electronic document to the system first register with the agency to which the document is to be submitted. The registration process must establish the identities of both the registrant, who is the prospective submitter, and any entity that the registrant is authorized to represent, and must establish that the registrant is authorized to submit the document in question for the entity being represented. In addition, where the documents to be received will require signature, the registration process must:
(1) Establish the registrant's identity, and the registrant's relation to any entity for which the registrant will submit electronic documents, with evidence that can be verified by information sources that are independent of the registrant and the entity or entities in question and that would be sufficient to identify the registrant as the signature holder for purposes of supporting litigation consistent with paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) Establish and document a unique correlation between the registrant and the code or device that will constitute or create the electronic signature of the registrant as a submitter;
(3) Require that the registrant sign on paper, or in such other manner or medium as the Administrator in his or her discretion may determine as appropriate for a category of electronic reports, an electronic signature agreement specifying at a minimum that the registrant agrees to:
(i) Protect the electronic signature from unauthorized use, and follow any procedures specified by the agency for this purpose;
(ii) Be held as legally bound, obligated, or responsible by use of the assigned electronic signature as by hand-written signature;
(iii) Where the signature method is based on a secret code or key, maintain the confidentiality of each component of the electronic signature;
(iv) In any case, never to delegate the use of the electronic signature, or in any other way intentionally provide access to its use, to any other individual for any reason; and
(v) Report to the entity specified in the electronic signature agreement, within twenty-four hours of discovery, any evidence of the loss, theft, or other compromise of any component of an electronic signature;
(4) Provide for the automatic and immediate revocation of an electronic signature in the event of:
(i) Any actual or apparent violation of the electronic signature agreement;
(ii) Any evidence that the signature has been compromised, whether or not this is reported by the registrant to whom the signature was issued; or
(iii) Notification from an entity that the registrant is no longer authorized by the entity to submit electronic documents on its behalf;
(5) Require that the registrant renew his or her electronic signature agreement at least once every two years, or upon request by EPA, with a renewal agreement that:
(i) Complies with the provisions listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and
(ii) Includes the registrant's certification that he or she has complied with provisions listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section since issuance of the signature, and that all reports submitted under the signature since the electronic signature agreement was last signed were reviewed and submitted by the registrant;
(6) Provide for a registrant who is surrendering his or her electronic signature to certify that he or she has complied with provisions listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section since issuance of the signature and that all reports submitted under the signature since the electronic signature agreement was last signed were reviewed and submitted by the registrant.

NATO and Article 5: The Transatlantic Alliance and the Twenty-First-Century Challenges of Collective Defense. John R. Deni. Lanhm, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017.
“An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.” Article 5, Treaty of Washington.
One may wonder what still needs to be written on NATO and Article 5. A thriving literature has been produced since 1949, dealing with its history, its strategic implications, and limits. Anchored in the unstable context of the Cold War, the Treaty of Washington’s Article 5 was designed to tie together European and US allies against the Soviet threat. In the 1990’s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Atlantic Alliance, built upon the fight against the communist great power, seemed to lose its raison d’être. As a result, NATO member states gave less priority to collective defense and Article 5, and gave more attention to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, focused on “crisis management.”
In NATO and Article 5. The Transatlantic Alliance and the Twenty-First-Century Challenges of Collective Defense, Dr. John Deni, a research professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College, analyzes the implications of the 2014 Crimea’s events on the organization’s strategic choices. In 2014, the annexation of Crimea by Russia rekindled the Russian threat on Eastern European member states, both on their territory and on their sovereignty. Faced with a new threat at home, the Alliance came back to territorial defence on European soil and turned to Article 5. Deni makes extensive use of official documents and interviews with key actors in telling the story of NATO’s strategic refocusing, and his book offers a useful contribution to the debate on to the core mission of NATO.
The debate about the Alliance’s future role in the world is split into two main factions.[1] On the one side, the apologists for a global NATO believe the Alliance’s missions should continue to include mainly out-of-area operations, like those pursued in Iraq and Afghanistan. Covering about 900 million people, who account for 45% of global GDP, NATO nations have global interests that require moving out of European territory.
On the opposite side are those who believe that NATO should come home, or go back to territorial defense and Article 5. Because of the threat that Russia poses to the territory and the sovereignty of new Eastern European NATO countries, these advocates claim that the Alliance should reaffirm its commitment to Article 5. Deni belongs to this camp.
First, Deni explores the strategic outcome pursued when seeking to return to Article 5. In a chapter entitled “NATO’s Russia Problem--Getting the Ends Right,” Deni analyzes NATO’s relationship with Russia. The annexation of Crimea showed the failure of the strategy of integration and partnership that NATO sought to achieve with Russia.
The strategy of integration was designed “to give Russia a greater stake in the international system, to promote civilian control of the military and elective government, to integrate Russia politically and diplomatically with the West, to diffuse any residual tension in East-West relations.”[2] This was designed as a means to “turn an adversary into a partner.”[3] The strategy turned into specific policies that are widely described by Deni, in a somehow arduous section for non-expert readers. Deni chooses to focus on political and military initiatives towards Russia.
Politically, the creation in 1997 of a Permanent Joint Council with Russia paved the way to a long history of political rapprochements, including the creation of the NATO-Russia Council in 2006 (intended to be more collaborative than the previous Permanent Joint Council). Political initiatives described by Deni further include bilateral partnerships between Russia and several NATO members outside NATO’s framework, such as the invitation made to Russia in 1998 by the Group of Seven (G7) to join the elite economic organization.
The annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the Donbas region are symptomatic of the failure of NATO’s approach to Russia.
At the military level, similarly, Deni describes several initiatives that contributed to a partnership relationship with neighbouring Russia. Thus, in 1991, Russia was invited to join the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), and in 1994, the Partnership for Peace. These economic efforts, while important, do not fall into the scope of NATO’s missions.

When seeking to assess whether the partnership strategy towards Russia worked, Deni’s conclusions are highly pessimistic. The annexation of Crimea and the invasion of the Donbas region are symptomatic of the failure of NATO’s approach to Russia. On these two occasions, Russia clearly violated many of the agreements and declaration signed with its “partner” NATO, including Article III of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration on the inviolability of frontiers, as well as Article IV on territorial integrity.
One may note the question raised by Deni as to whether the West is really at fault concerning such a failure. In an extensive literature on NATO and Russia, Deni brings an interesting perspective on this issue. According to Deni, Russia’s porous borders and its history—“Russia has experienced an invasion across the Northern European plain about once every thirty-three years on average”—have generated a widespread sense of insecurity within the population, promoting what Deni identifies as a zero-sum approach that prevents it from pursuing a partnership with another country.
Because of the cul-de-sac situation met by the NATO-Russia relationship, a new strategy is necessary according to Deni. Indefinitely recycling the same failing strategies will not help changing Russia. In the end, “Only the Russians can change Russia.”
Deni then explores the means available to NATO in order to implement the new strategy it needs. Territorial wars are expensive. Therefore, NATO would require many years of defense spending increases to return to a posture of strong territorial defense in the spirit of Article 5. Thus, studying NATO’s strategic refocusing to territorial defense and Article 5 implies assessing the organization’s financial strength and investments. Deni emphasizes what is probably the most discussed issue within NATO members: burden-sharing.
The longstanding US insistence on the need for European NATO members to get more involved financially—strongly reasserted by President Donald Trump—has led to some progress in trying to achieve the 2% target of GDP dedicated to defence spending. On June 8th, 2006, indeed, NATO members committed, during the Defence ministers meeting, to endeavour to meet the 2% goal. Although this was not a binding commitment, the target was renewed during the Wales Summit of 2014 and crystallizes many of the current discussions on burden-sharing within NATO. According to Deni, the 2% target does not cover the main challenges faced by NATO when pursuing its new strategy. Burden-sharing, for him, needs to be understood in context and requires taking into account the level of financial and investment cooperation between members. In this domain, as Deni indicates, initiatives like the Prague Summit of 2002, in which individual NATO members agreed—only politically—to the Prague Capabilities Commitments (PCC) intended to share the financial burden more equitably between the allies. Nevertheless, much effort still needs to be made. For Deni, the lack of financial involvement in NATO might be due to the fact that Russia, since the mid-2010s, is no longer perceived as the main threat by the allies. Thus, public opinion survey from the Pew Research center demonstrate that, in July 2015, as in 2016, the Islamic State is much more feared. Data from 2016 highlighted by Deni also shows that most Europeans do not favor hard military force to defeat Islamic extremism.
Deni demonstrated the need for a new NATO strategy towards Russia as well as the financial challenges facing the refocusing to Article 5. Lastly, the author explores the “how” question, i.e. what needs to be done in order to bring back collective defense.
For Deni, what matters for NATO is not much about the amount of money dedicated to defense, but more importantly, the type of investments that is being made.

To do so, Deni explores an interesting question. Although there has been a recent upward swing in defense spending—which might result, according to Deni, from the annexation of Crimea—a close study as to where the investments are directed highlights remaining efforts that need to be addressed when focusing on territorial defense. For Deni, what matters for NATO is not much about the amount of money dedicated to defense, but more importantly, the type of investments that is being made. Thus, European NATO member states are incentivized to overinvest in equipment, both as a means to support their defense industries and to acquire the prestige that is tied to the acquisition of advanced military technology. Consequently, they also underinvest in training and exercises. Because they do not train collectively, NATO forces are not used to operating together and they lack readiness. As a consequence, Deni explains that “average response time lines are lengthening across the alliance.” In the guns versus readiness battle within NATO investments, equipment and artillery acquisitions win in every country.
Deni’s book offers useful analysis of the implications of such reduced readiness spending. What could the future hold for an Alliance with modern equipment that does not know how to use it appropriately? As Deni sums up, “the lack of readiness fundamentally threatens the ability of member states to make good on their Article 5 commitment to each other.”[4]
In the somehow contentious debates between two perspectives on the Alliance’s future, Deni offers a useful and detailed overview of what the challenges would be for NATO in returning to collective defense and Article 5. He includes notable recent international developments, particularly those linked to the surprise election of Donald Trump in the United States. In a book whose logic is to study the political and strategic decisions of actors that are thought to be rational, the election of Trump and its subsequent unpredictability in terms of foreign policy appear as interesting subjects that we hope Deni will delve into further in the future.
It is said that a book is worthwhile when it raises more questions than it provides answers. Reading Deni left me with an impressive set of inquiries regarding NATO’s future, and his seeking to move the subject beyond a US-centric approach deserves attention by young scholars. Hence, I recommend this book to not only researchers and students, but also decision-makers, who should strive to pose more questions and investigate viable responses to our current state of affairs.

Donald Trump on 60 Minutes: The 10 Most Surprising Revelations

President-elect Donald Trump — yes, it’s still strange to say that — sat down with CBS’ 60 Minutes on Sunday to discuss what he plans to accomplish when he takes office in January. And some of his comments were nearly as surprising as his campaign’s victory.
In an in-depth conversation with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl in Trump Tower on Friday, a noticeably subdued Trump addressed which of his campaign promises he intended to keep, his post-election conversations with Hillary Clinton and President Obama, and his reaction to the acts of racially charged violence being carried out in his name across the country.
Here, the ten most surprising revelations from Donald Trump’s 60 Minutes interview:
1. He’s already made nice with many of his opponents.
This presidential campaign was one of the most bitter we’ve ever seen, but Trump struck a conciliatory note with the candidates he battled against. He said of Hillary Clinton’s phone call to concede: “She couldn’t have been nicer. She’s a great competitor. Very strong. Very smart.” He noted that Bill Clinton and both President Bushes called to congratulate him. And he described his meeting with President Obama in cordial terms: “I found him to be terrific. I found him to be very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor.”
2. The “Wall” may be more like a fence.
Stahl asked Trump directly about his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S./Mexico border, adding that some have said it’ll really be more like a fence. Would he accept that, she asked? “For certain areas, I would,” he responded, adding, “I’m very good at this. It’s called construction.” But he doubled down on his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants: “The people with criminal records, we’re getting them out of our country, or we’re going to incarcerate.” He did note, though, that some of those immigrants are “terrific people.”

3. He’s already working with lobbyists… but he doesn’t like it.
Trump railed against the lobbyists and special-interest groups that dominate Washington during his campaign, but Stahl noted that he’s already added a number of lobbyists to his transition team. Trump copped to this, saying “I don’t like it, no,” but they’re “the only people you have down there. That’s the problem with the system. We’re gonna clean it up. They know the system right now, but we’re gonna phase that out.”
4. He wants any of his supporters attacking minorities to “stop it.”
Trump feigned ignorance when Stahl asked him about the rash of racially charged attacks on minorities since his election: “I’m very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it.” (He added, “I think it’s a very small amount.”) What would he say to Trump supporters taunting and attacking minorities? “I say stop it. If it helps. I’ll say it right to the camera: Stop it.” He later added, “I think it’s horrible, if it’s happening.” But he cautioned: “I think it’s built up by the press.”

5. He credits social media for his big win.
Trump is a notorious tweeter, and he intends to continue using Twitter and other social media in a “very restrained” manner as President: “It’s a great form of communication.” He sees it as a way to get his message out when he’s criticized by the mainstream media: “I have a method of fighting back.” And he thinks it was instrumental in his victory: “I think it helped me win all these races where they spent much more money than I did. I think social media has more power than the money they spent.”
6. He won’t commit to locking Hillary Clinton up.
Despite promising that he would appoint a special prosecutor to put Hillary Clinton in jail if he won, Trump’s stance has softened. “I’m gonna think about it,” he says. “I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on health care.” He insists “she did some bad things,” but he showed sympathy for the Clintons: “I don’t want to hurt them. They’re good people.” He’ll keep us in suspense on this one, he tells Stahl: “I’ll give you a very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes.”

7. Even Melania thinks he goes too far sometimes.
Future First Lady Melania Trump also sat down with Stahl, and she addressed his aggressive approach on Twitter: “Sometimes it got him in trouble, but it helped a lot as well.” Did she ever tell him he crossed the line? “I did. Of course I did. Many times. Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn’t… I think he hears me, but he will do what he wants to do in the end.”
8. He won’t fight to overturn gay marriage.
Opposition to LGBT rights has been a part of the Republican platform for decades, but Trump signaled that he doesn’t want to continue that fight. When Stahl brought up the LGBT community, he proudly replied, “I mentioned them at the Republican national convention.” And he’s not planning to oppose gay marriage in the courts, he says: “It’s irrelevant, because it’s already settled. It’s done. I’m fine with that.”

9. He’d be in favor of ditching the electoral college.
The electoral college system gave Trump the win (Hillary won the popular vote), and Trump, shockingly, isn’t against switching to a straight popular vote count. “I would rather see it where you went with simple votes,” he said. “You know, you got 100 million votes, someone else gets 90 million votes…” But he added, in defense of the electoral college: “There’s a reason for doing this, because it brings all the states into play. And there’s something very good about that. I do respect the system.”
10. He’ll only take a dollar per year in salary.
Trump doesn’t need the salary that comes with the office of president — around $400,000 a year — and he confirmed to Stahl that he’ll forego that salary: “I think I have to, by law, take one dollar. So I’ll take one dollar a year.” He didn’t even know how much the president makes, and had to ask Stahl. But he reiterated: “I’m not taking it.” The savings won’t pay off the national debt… but it’s a start.

Va. News: Portrait Prompts Change of Venue Request, Convicted City Council candidate
Virginia law seems to have no clear answers about how to handle the case of a Portsmouth city councilman. And lawyers for a man accused of murder want his trial moved out of a courtroom where a portrait of Robert E. Lee is prominently displayed.
Those have been among the most read stories over the past week at the Virginia Public Access Project’s Va. News link.
More now from Fred Echols.

Chances of Needing Long Term Care

The Risk of Long Term Care is Significant
Consider the following…
Consultants Conning & Company published a study indicating that almost two-thirds of those individual sreaching age 65 will need long-term care at some time in their lives.¹
The Wall Street Journal, in a 2000 article, observed that “. . . a couple turning 65 [has] a 75 percent chance that one of them will need long-term care.”²
The chart below³ illustrates the risk of needing Long Term Care compared to the risks of an automobile accident or fire in a home, events that most people typically insure themselves for…
While the risk of an auto accident or home fire is less than 1%, the risk of a Long Term Care event is currently 50%.
And according to the table below4, 56% of individuals 85 and older can expect to require Long Term Care in a nursing home environment, and these figures are expected to increasing significantly in the years ahead…

Simply Irresistible? “Second-Cheapest” Restaurant Wine in Theory & Practice
March 22, 2016 By Mike Veseth in restaurant wine, wine, wine price	2 Comments
Last week I wrote about the theory that you should always order the second-cheapest wine on a restaurant’s list. The second-cheapest wine rule as it is usually explained, is a naive application of game theory to the problem of ordering restaurant wine.
The premise is that the restaurant is trying to gouge its wine-drinking customers and that it does this by putting incredibly high mark-ups on the cheapest wine on the list. Diners are drawn to the cheapest wine because of the high general level of wine prices, the theory goes, and so the restaurant rakes in the dough when diners opt for the least expensive bottle.
So where does the second-cheapest wine theory come in? Well, since you are smart and know that the cheapest wine is a rip-off, you can “stick it to the man” by ordering the second-cheapest wine instead. Second-cheapest wine — the sweet spot in every wine list!
Game Theory in Circles
Now there is a lot that is problematic with this scenario, beginning with the premise (see below), but the game theory is bad, too. It implicitly assumes that restaurants are ignorant of the second-cheapest theory, which they obviously are not, and do not adopt a counter-strategy, which they probably would.
If an evil restaurant wine manager knows the theory and wants to rip you off, he or she can manipulate the situation by simply raising the mark-up on the second-cheapest wine, making it the worst deal of the list. It’s tit for tat, as they say in game theory (economics note: there really is a non-cooperative “prisoner dilemma” game theory strategy called “tit for tat.”)
Your logical response, I suppose, would be to shift to the third-cheapest wine since the second-cheapest is now a loser. But once the restaurant figures out your new strategy you will need to move up a notch again to avoid being ripped off. Play this out ad nauseum and you arrive at ultimate ridiculous rule-of-thumb: always buy the most expensive wine on the list.
And once the evil restaurant masterminds figure that out, your only recourse is obvious — buy the cheapest wine! (Or maybe just buy a beer.) That’s the problem with these rules of thumb — they sometimes lead you in circles until your head spins.
More Than One Way to Play That Game!
The real problem with the second-cheapest rule is the premise — that the restaurant is always out to gouge you. Megan Krigbaum at Punch published an empirical investigation of second-cheapest by-the-glass wines at New York restaurants a couple of days after my column went live last week and she found several sommeliers who play the game by a different set of rules.
These restaurants want to get their diners to try interesting wines that will bring them back again and again and so they price them on the low side to induce otherwise cautious diners to sample them. Sometimes they even intentionally make them the second-cheapest wine because they think some of their customers won’t be able to resist the bait and will be rewarded with a very pleasant surprise.
Does this prove that the second-cheapest rule is valid — always buy the second-cheapest wine? Well, it shows that sometimes it will get you a nice wine at a restaurant that wants you to have a great experience and come back for more. And, to be honest, you probably don’t need a rule-of-thumb to have a great wine experience at a restaurant like that!
An Alternative Strategy
I have a one-word rule of thumb when it comes to restaurant wine: communicate. When in doubt, start a conversation. Talk about what you’d like to eat, like to drink, prefer to pay and challenge your server or sommelier to help find the right wine.
Some people don’t like to do this because they fear it shows their ignorance. They are the same people who won’t ask for directions when they get lost, I suppose.
The conversation strategy doesn’t always work — sometimes it will get you an up-sell pitch or expose a server’s lack of wine knowledge — but it strikes me as a better opening gambit than any price-based rule.
What’s the best way to talk with a sommelier? Read this article by Carson Demmond in the current issue of Food & Wine for some ideas.

Great article! Particularly liked this line – “They are the same people who won’t ask for directions when they get lost, I suppose.” Sometimes I think we forget that somms are actually there to help, and if you give them clear guidelines, they should do just that. It’s just a case of finding places where you feel comfortable, where you feel in good hands and can trust the somm. Not always easy to find!

There are ways that restaurant owners/management and staff can make the “wine” selection drama of their customers when handed the wIne list, a pleasant no bs carefree adventure. This would assume that a restaurant cares about its customers enough to not overcharge them for the wines they sell to said customers and are savvy enough to have a terrific wine by the glass selection to please wine drinkers of all stripes(novice to pro). Really, how hard is it for a restaurant to put together a decent wine list and teach the staff enough so that they are comfortable enough with the wines on it to be of “service” to customers?

The Weirdest Rock Stories of 2018
Martin Kielty
Share on Twitter
Share on Facebook
After looking back on the biggest, the coolest, the nastiest and the funniest rock stories of 2018, we arrive at the last refuge of the scoundrel – the weirdest stories of 2018.
This year’s scoundrels include a drug-smuggling Iron Maiden tribute artist, a YouTuber who appears to hate music, an organization who want you to attend concerts without actually going plus an artist who’s either a master troll or an unhailed genius. And, perhaps predictably, Donald Trump. Those and more can be found in the gallery below, and after that you can find links to our full stories on them.
We’ll admit it: sometimes, just sometimes, it can feel as if reporting rock news is a never-ending cycle of album releases, tour announcements, lineup changes and reunions. Even working in the music industry can get boring. When a weird story comes up it’s a breath of fresh air, and a reminder of why we do what we do. And since weird stories are entirely unpredictable, we can’t begin to guess what form they’ll take in 2019. We can’t wait.

Semper Fi, Gunny. Godspeed. pic.twitter.com/vf4O78JKmb
— R. Lee Ermey (@RLeeErmey) April 15, 2018
Ermey, known for his military and authoritarian roles, served 11 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he became staff sergeant and later was given the honorary rank of gunnery sergeant.
After injuries forced him to retire, Ermey studied acting. His most famous role was in Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war drama "Full Metal Jacket," for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award, according to the Internet Movie Database.
He also appeared in "Se7en," "Mississippi Burning" and a remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
Fans of "The Gunny" as well as other actors and celebrities took to social media to share their condolences Sunday.
#SemperFidelis Always faithful. Always loyal.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
RIP amigo. ✌🏽PVT. Joker #FullMetalJacket @RLeeErmey @StanleyKubrick @vincentdonofrio @ViKu1111 pic.twitter.com/AYbWQmLxy1

Drug Rehab and Treatment Centers Information Lake Harbor, Florida
Looking for Drug Rehab and treatment centers in Lake Harbor, Florida?
There are numerous drug treatment centers possibilities open to the people living in the Lake Harbor area. You will need to recognize each one of the types of rehab possibilities that are available in Lake Harbor, AB., so that you can pick the appropriate rehabilitation approach for yourself or someone you care about. Choosing the proper drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility in Lake Harbor is the most important element in the treatment of drug abuse, addiction and alcoholism. This information will help you understand your numerous rehabilitation options so that you have the maximum probability of a successful outcome.
Let's check out the many drug and alcohol treatment centers in Lake Harbor, Florida possibilities that correlate with the circumstances of the person looking for rehab.
Inpatient drug and alcohol treatment in Lake Harbor, AB. is often a rehab possibility ideal for many who need medical treatment during rehabilitation or individuals with considerable substance abuse histories. Women and men can develop both mental and physical dependence to drugs even after a short period of time, so inpatient alcohol and drug rehab in Lake Harbor is considered the most effective rehabilitation option in nearly all scenarios. As a result of dependence and addiction, women and men will usually be unable to make a full recovery using the minimal services made available from outpatient rehabilitation facilities in Lake Harbor, Florida where alcohol and drugs continue to be easily obtainable when they depart the outpatient center. In addition, people in treatment who receive outpatient treatment instead of inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Lake Harbor remain vulnerable to detrimental influences and circumstances that might get in the way of their process of recovery. If a person resides with an abusive partner or maintains associations that entail drug abuse, any treatment endeavours in outpatient treatment are done in vain. This is the reason in-patient alcohol and drug treatment in Lake Harbor, AB. will produce more tangible outcomes that will prove lasting as opposed to an outpatient drug and alcohol rehab program where benefits could be very minimal and acute.
In Lake Harbor there's both short-term and long-term inpatient alcohol and drug treatment. Short-term is often a 30-day center, while long-term inpatient drug and alcohol treatment in Lake Harbor, Florida is much more prolonged and treatment lasts 90-120 days generally speaking. It becomes an ideal setting for clients as it is a secure drug-free setting where they can recover both mentally and physically without distraction. Preferably, men and women proceed within a long-term in-patient drug rehab facility in Lake Harbor for the maximum time frame permitted, to be able to deal with anything that might cut across their sobriety once they leave rehabilitation. Due to the fact detoxing and becoming physically stable can require 2-3 weeks by itself, the 3-6 months in long-term in-patient alcohol and drug rehabilitation in Lake Harbor is going to be time spent well and a lot more effective than short-term programs.
The most important aspect of all if you or a loved one has a drug abuse or addiction issue is to do something about it, make calls and talk to trained addiction professionals and get an evaluation and rehab possibilities to ensure the greatest opportunity for a recovery.

About Yttrium Metal
Yttrium Metal is available as disc, granules, ingot, pellets, pieces, powder, rod, sputtering target, wire, and in numerous other forms and custom shapes. Ultra high purity and high purity forms also include metal powder, submicron powder and nanoscale, quantum dots, targets for thin film deposition, pellets for evaporation and single crystal or polycrystalline forms. Elements can also be introduced into alloys or other systems as fluorides, oxides or chlorides or as solutions. Yttrium metal is generally immediately available in most volumes. Yttrium has the highest thermo-dynamic affinity for oxygen, useful in ceramics for crucibles for molten reactive metals, in florescent phosphors, computer displays and automotive fuel sensors. Yttria stabilized zirconia is used in high temperature applications and as an electrolyte in fuel cells. American Elements produces to many standard grades when applicable, including Mil Spec (military grade); ACS, Reagent and Technical Grade; Food, Agricultural and Pharmaceutical Grade; Optical Grade, USP and EP/BP (European Pharmacopoeia/British Pharmacopoeia) and follows applicable ASTM testing standards. Typical and custom packaging is available. Additional technical, research and safety (MSDS) information is available as is a Reference Calculator for converting relevant units of measurement.

39 Y 88.905850000 Yttrium
See more Yttrium products. Yttrium (atomic symbol: Y, atomic number: 39) is a Block D, Group 3, Period 5 element with an atomic weight of 88.90585. The number of electrons in each of yttrium's shells is [2, 8, 18, 9, 2] and its electron configuration is [Kr] 4d1 5s2. The yttrium atom has a radius of 180 pm and a Van der Waals radius of 219 pm. Yttrium was discovered by Johann Gadolin in 1794 and first isolated by Carl Gustav Mosander in 1840. In its elemental form, Yttrium has a silvery white metallic appearance. Yttrium has the highest thermodynamic affinity for oxygen of any element. Yttrium is not found in nature as a free element and is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals. While not part of the rare earth series, it resembles the heavy rare earths which are sometimes referred to as the "yttrics" for this reason. Another unique characteristic derives from its ability to form crystals with useful properties. The name yttrium originated from a Swedish village near Vaxholm called Yttbery where it was discovered.

Retirement Tax Considerations for Middle-Income Americans
Taxes in Retirement
Featured Study - 2014
Key Findings
More Americans have an accurate understanding of how lottery winnings are taxed (94%) than the mainstays of their retirement income: Social Security benefits (39%), traditional IRAs (35%), Roth IRAs (31%) and 401(k) plans (29%).
When asked to choose which activity they dislike the most, respondents say that doing taxes (23%) is almost equally as disliked as the unpleasant experience of going through airport security (29%). In fact, getting a flu shot is preferable to doing taxes for many middle-income Americans over age 50. Only 6% ranked flu shots as their most disliked task.
Many middle-income Americans age 50 and older have significant gaps in their understanding of how federal taxes will impact their retirement finances. In fact, they know more about how lottery winnings are taxed than the mainstays of their retirement income.
Adults aged 50 and older in this income bracket could face negative tax implications as they near and enter retirement. Among other consequences, they risk incorrectly estimating future income from their retirement accounts, paying penalties on withdrawals, missing allowable deductions and other consequences.
With its newest study, Bankers Life Center for a Secure Retirement looks at the impact of taxes and tax knowledge on Americans’ retirement finances.

China overtaken by Japan in stock market rankings, in slump blamed on trade war
‘But there’s still a chance that China’s stock market will recover…. After all, the economic fundamentals are still stable and growth momentum will resume’
03 August 2018 - 11:00 Agency Staff
Picture: REUTERS/ALY SONG
Shanghai — China just lost its ranking as the world’s number two stock market.
After a slump on Thursday, Chinese equities were worth $6.09-trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with $6.17-trillion in Japan. The US has by far the world’s largest stock market, at just over $31-trillion.
China’s stock market overtook Japan’s in late 2014, then soared to a record high valuation of more than $10-trillion in June 2015.
Chinese equities and the nation’s currency have taken a beating this year amid a trade spat with the US, a government-led campaign to cut debt and a slowing economy.
"Losing the ranking to Japan is the damage caused by the trade war," said Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp in Hong Kong.
"The Japan equity gauge is relatively more stable around the current level but China’s market cap has slumped from its peak this year."
The Shanghai composite index has lost more than 16% in 2018 to be among the world’s worst performers. Industrial and tech stocks have been among China’s worst performers, with those sub-gauges on the CSI 300 index of large caps sliding more than 20% this year.
China’s Politburo, made up of the Communist Party’s 25 most senior leaders, signalled on Tuesday that policy makers would focus more on supporting economic growth amid risks from the deleveraging campaign and the trade standoff.
Still, the Shanghai composite index is headed for its worst week in more than a month.
"The market will likely continue to hover at low levels for the next couple of months," said Linus Yip, Hong Kong-based strategist with First Shanghai Securities.
"But there’s still a chance that China’s stock market will recover, with total capitalisation ascending to the world’s number two place again. After all, the economic fundamentals are still stable and growth momentum will resume after a short-term downturn."
Global role
Losing the number two spot is a reminder that China’s role in global financial markets — while large — still does not match its economic might.
Policy makers have pledged to open areas such as investment limits on industries from banking to agriculture, but foreign ownership of equities and bonds remains low.
The yuan’s share of global payments fell to 1.81% in June from 1.88% a month earlier, according to data from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
While Japan’s benchmark Topix index has declined about 4% this year, it remains one of the better-performing markets in Asia amid support from the Bank of Japan’s exchange-traded fund purchases and as most companies continue to report robust earnings growth. Almost 60% of companies on the gauge that have reported in the current earnings season have beaten analyst expectations.
The yuan has weakened more than 8% against the dollar in the past six months, and there are few signs the nation’s central bank has been intervening in the currency market. China’s currency is in line for an eighth weekly retreat, the longest run since the start of the country’s modern foreign-exchange rate regime in 1994.
The onshore yuan was down 0.47% at 6.8705 against the dollar in lunchtime trade in Shanghai.
The yuan’s tumble has prompted forecasters to lower their estimates for the exchange rate. Deutsche Bank was among the latest to do so, cutting its year-end prediction to 6.95 per dollar from 6.8 on Wednesday, saying trade tensions would probably put persistent pressure on China’s current account in the next few years.
The market value calculations include primary listings only, to avoid double-counting. Hong Kong’s equities are valued at $5.1-trillion.

Comedy royalty: Andrea Martin and John Belushi earned their crowns on the Second City stage in the 1970s.
CBS
To be FIRST AMONG SECONDS sounds logically impossible. Not so for the members of one hardworking comedy troupe, now marking its 50th anniversary. Our Cover Story is reported by contributor Nancy Giles:
John Belushi . . . Steve Carell . . . Tina Fey . . . Bill Murray . . . a virtual Who's Who of American comedy. What do they have in common?
They all came from Second City, a powerhouse of comedy theatre.
Full disclosure: I was in the Second City touring company back in 1984. (I wasn't exactly in the "who's who" category.)
They've been knocking 'em dead for half a century at Second City, 50 laugh-a-minute years that have spawned two resident companies, four touring companies, and theatres in Chicago and Toronto.
"It's like doing Shakespeare, really," said Andrea Martin, who performed both on stage, and starred in "SCTV," the comedy series created by Second City in 1976.
"It's like doing Shakespeare 'cause you think, 'Think of all the people that have come before me and I'm saying those words.' And it somehow bolsters you and makes you feel part of an instant family."
So, what makes a great Second City actor?
"Well, they have to be smart," says Andrew Alexander, co-owner and executive producer of Second City. "They have to be funny. You know, they have to be prepared to support their fellow actor. I think those three ingredients are what we look for."
It all started in Chicago, the "Second City," the Windy City, in a converted Chinese laundry in 1959.
Some twenty years earlier, in the 1930s, Viola Spolin had the idea to use improvisational games to teach immigrant kids to communicate. Her son, Paul Sills, put those games on stage, and improv comedy was born.
(CBS)
"Second City has defined a process for making funny," said Kelly Leonard, Second City's executive vice president. "And what we do is we create 'triple threats.' We create actors who can write, who can perform, and who can improvise."
(Left: John Candy and Bill Murray, part of the Second City comedy troupe in the 1970s.)
In the '60s and '70s, Second City's political irreverence and spontaneity attracted a lot of attention. Film writer and director Harold Ramis ("Groundhog Day") came to Second City in 1969. He recalls, "Abbie Hoffman used to improvise with us, during the conspiracy hearing."
"Wow. Was he good?" asked Giles.
"No," Ramis laughed. "He was a little self-centered. But he did manage to sleep with all the women!"
One of the keys to successful improve is sharing the spotlight.
"I now tell film students, and acting students, 'Identify the most talented person in the room. And if it's not you, go stand next to them.'
"And that's what I did: I saw Bill Murray, 'Hey, can I come along?'"
"As opposed to competing with him?" Giles said.
"Yeah, or John Belushi. How can I [stand] with John on stage, total force of nature? You didn't go up against it. My thought was, well, how can I serve this amazing talent?"
(CBS)
Ramis (left) served that talent by writing blockbuster comedies, including "Animal House," "Ghostbusters" and "Caddyshack," which he also directed.
"I had Bill Murray for six days. I knew he was the best improvising actor in America. So I thought, I'm just gonna let him talk. So there are scenes, the fully improv'ed scene in the movie is one of the most popular comedy scenes of the last 30 years. Cinderella story in "Caddyshack."
"That was all improvised?"
"Fully improvised, yeah, yeah."
Bill Murray's "Cinderella Story" From "Caddyshack"
"I'd never done characters," said Martin Short, who began at Second City in 1977 on the Toronto stage, where he learned to invent characters - zany characters, like the nerdy oddball Ed Grimley.
"I was kind of doing a little bit of my brother-in-law, a little bit of this guy I knew in high school who wanted to be a photographer. He wanted to take slides! And it's his voice. You could almost draw the notes at dah, dah, dah, dah."
Of course, Second City isn't just a star factory: It's a $30 million a year business that goes well beyond the box office.
There are improv classes with more than 2,000 students. There's a summer camp for kids.
And there's Second City Communications, where troupe members help launch new products and spice up business meetings and events with a little improv.
In some ways, Second City is just a big school, and like students in high school or college, performers only stay at Second City for three or four years before they move on.
Fame doesn't come at Second City . . . it only comes afterward, if at all.
"We're not trying to own those people forever," said Kelly Leonard, "even though we've helped hone their careers and train them, at a stage when no one knew who they were."
It's been fifty years of laughs . . . fifty years of trials and errors . . . of stars and second bananas…
And what those 50 years have shown is that Second City . . . is second to none.

A Pasadena teenager who is accused of crashing a stolen car and killing another motorist earlier this month will face a judge Friday, when prosecutors are expected to argue for a high bond to keep him in jail to protect public safety.
Prosecutors allege it is the third time the youthful motorist has caused a wreck in a stolen car, according to court filings.
Jared Trevino, an 18-year-old who according to court records has autism and ADHD, is charged with felony murder. He is accused of running a stop light in a stolen car on February 3 and killing Lorenzo Gomez after smashing into his car.
On Friday, Trevino is scheduled to appear before state District Judge Chris Morton.
Sean Teare, the prosecutor and head of the Harris County District Attorney’s vehicular crimes division, said he expects to call police officers from the Pasadena Police Department and the Pasadena Independent School District to show that Trevino can not be trusted if he is free on bail.
“An 18-year-old broke into his neighbor’s home, stole a car that he has stolen before, took it on basically on a joy ride, ran a ride light and killed a man who was a husband and a father,” Teare told reporters after scheduling a hearing. “This person is a continuing danger to society and should, at the very least, have a very high bond.”
Teare was standing next to Pasadena Police Chief Josh Bruegger who also said Trevino should have a high bail amount.
Trevino’s attorney, Joe Vinas, said he’s still investigating the allegations but hopes that Trevino can be released on a personal recognizance bond, or “free bond.”
“He’s got no criminal convictions,” Vinas said. “The state wants to hold him at, in my opinion, an unconstitutional and impermissibly high bond.”
Trevino is accused of breaking into his neighbor’s pickup truck on Feb. 3, using the garage door opener to get into the man’s home. Once inside, Trevino allegedly took the keys to a Honda Accord and fled in the sedan, court records show.
The teen is accused of running the red light at the corner of Spencer Highway and Preston Rd, colliding with a Cadillac Deville driven by Gomez. He was transported to the hospital with a fractured skull that caused a brain bleed, and found to be brain dead. Gomez died three days later.
The wreck is the second time Trevino allegedly stole the same Honda from his neighbor. The first incident was in December 2017, and after stealing the Honda he crashed into a trailer at a red light, according to court records. After that arrest, court records show, his mother told police he has autism and takes medication for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. She also told investigators that he has a history of taking cars when the keys are available.
In November 2017, Trevino also allegedly stole a Nissan Sentra from one of his mother’s employees while it was parked in Trevino’s driveway. He is accused of crashing that car into a woman’s Silverado pickup truck, fleeing that scene and crashing into a man’s Ford Ranger truck.
Felony murder is the crime of causing a death while committing another felony, in this case stealing a car. If convicted, Trevino faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

WASHINGTON - Pitching legend Roger Clemens suffered a setback at his perjury trial Monday with testimony from prosecution witness Brian McNamee that complicated Clemens' claims that McNamee was targeting him with incriminating evidence to obtain lenient treatment from federal prosecutors.
McNamee, Clemens' former strength coach, told jurors that he had arranged for three other players in addition to Clemens to obtain human growth hormone.
He told jurors he had injected current Yankee pitcher Andy Pettitte and former Yankee infielder Chuck Knoblauch with human growth hormone as well as arranging for former Yankee relief pitcher Mike Stanton to obtain the banned substance directly from his supplier, New York steroid dealer Kirk Radomski.
The three players have admitted using the hormone in congressional testimony or grand jury testimony - admissions that could help corroborate McNamee's claims that Clemens also used the same banned substance.
Allowed to use names
Clemens' defense team has been insisting that McNamee, fearing federal prosecution, provided federal authorities evidence against Clemens to set the stage for the 2008 congressional inquiry into doping in baseball.
McNamee claims he injected Clemens with anabolic steroids or human growth hormone on multiple occasions between 1998 and 2001 - allegations the Houston-based pitching ace has repeatedly denied.
McNamee hadn't been allowed to name the players before. But U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton set aside earlier concerns that Clemens could suffer guilt by association if McNamee were permitted to name other players who had received the banned substance through him and had later admitted using it.
Walton said Justice Department lawyers could bring in evidence that McNamee was not "targeting" Clemens alone after defense attorney Rusty Hardin had made that case to the jury last week.
"You can only use that (testimony) for the limited purpose of assessing his credibility as a witness," Walton told jurors, adding that jurors could not "infer" anything about Clemens' alleged use of the medications from the fact that three other players obtained the drug from McNamee and used it.
Jurors offer questions
Jurors also got a chance to ask more than two dozen questions that touched on several topics including McNamee's personal use of performance-enhancing drugs, his relationship with a former drug dealer based in New York and his reasons to keep medical waste that he says he used to inject Clemens.
In the unusual process, Walton has allowed the jurors in this trial to query witnesses throughout the proceedings.
Walton asks jurors whether they have any questions after prosecutors and defense attorneys finish interviewing each witness.
Jurors hoping for additional answers write questions on cards and submit them to the judge. Walton then discusses potential questions with prosecutors and defense attorneys and asks witnesses the ones he deems appropriate.
"Why did you keep the evidence after shots?" the judge read McNamee the question submitted from a juror.
"I had originally kept it just to have my family life to be a better place place to go to," McNamee responded. "I was just getting a lot of problems at home about what I was doing. My wife knew about it."
Cemens, 49, faces six felony counts of lying to Congress during sworn testimony in 2008 where the seven-time Cy Young Award winner denied using performance-enhancing drugs during a 24-season career with four teams, including the Houston Astros.
Clemens could face up to 30 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine if convicted on all six charges.

To End Wars—Trump vs. Sanders
View all posts from this blog
By:Pat Buchanan | October 16, 2015
Barack Obama sought as his legacy to bring an end to the two longest wars in U.S. history. On Oct. 15, he, again, admitted failure.
The 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan will remain another year. And, on Inauguration Day 2017, 5,500 U.S. troops will still be there.
Why cannot we leave? Because, if we do, we risk the re-seizure of power by the Taliban we drove out 14 years ago, and a wipeout of all we have accomplished in America's longest war.
When can we come home? Never, if we hope to secure that for which we have already paid with 2,500 U.S. dead.
For not only have the Taliban shown they can capture cities like Kunduz in the north, ISIS has arrived to begin its trademark atrocities. One can only imagine what will happen to the men, women and girls we liberated when we leave, and Kabul falls. Think Saigon, 1975.
In reluctantly deciding not to depart, Obama seems to have learned the lesson of Iraq. There, we have gone back in with 3,000 U.S. troops, after the president had pulled out the last 10,000.
And what is the balance sheet now on Operation Iraqi Freedom, the bloodiest and most costly American war since Vietnam?
The Islamic State controls Mosul, Ramadi and the huge Sunni province of Anbar. Baghdad relies on U.S. air power against ISIS, but looks to Tehran for guidance. The Shiite militias indispensable to the regime's survival are, most of them, pro-ayatollah and anti-American.
Unloved and unappreciated, the American Empire soldiers on.
Understandably, President Obama does not want a collapse on his watch in Baghdad or Kabul, though he opposed the Iraq war and was never an enthusiast of nation-building in the Hindu Kush.
The liberal interventionists and neocons who goaded George W. Bush on got us into these wars. But they had no clue as to what would happen once we got in, and they have no idea today on how we can get out. Indeed, they have no desire to get out.
Rather, they want us to repudiate the nuclear deal that the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany negotiated with Iran, and impose new sanctions. And if Iran refuses to renegotiate and yield, they would happily exercise "all options on the table."
They would not rule out yet another American war, on Iran, which has a larger population than Afghanistan and Iraq put together, and is far better prepared and equipped to defend itself.
They want the United States to sustain the "good" rebels in Syria and to insist that "Assad must go." Asked who rises if Assad falls, if not ISIS, they dismiss the question.
But if ISIS is the enemy with whom we cannot deal, why do we not partner with Putin, the Iranians, the Syrian army of Bashar Assad and the Kurds to all pile on and annihilate ISIS in Syria and Iraq?
John Kerry's repetitive reply—"Assad must go!"
Vladimir Putin's retort—the Americans have "mush for brains."
Looking at what we sought to do with our interventions in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan, has any of them turned out as the war hawks predicted, or we had hoped? Do the prospects of any of these failed states look better for our intervention?
Yet the Beltway hawks now want to confront Russia in Syria and Ukraine, and are looking forward to challenging China's claims to islets in the Spratly chain by sailing U.S. warships inside the 12-mile limit.
Republican presidential candidates like Lindsey Graham are even talking up sending U.S. ground forces back into Iraq and into Syria.
What we could accomplish there, and when we could get out, are questions that are not only unanswered, they are unasked.
In analyzing the presidential race, the one conclusion upon which all agree is that the anti-Washington, anti-incumbent sentiment is far deeper and wider than most had imagined.
The surge in the polls of Bernie Sanders at the expense of Hillary Clinton, and of Donald Trump at the expense of the GOP establishment, are the political stories of the year.
And what do Socialist Sanders and Capitalist Trump have in common? Neither is an interventionist—both opposed the Iraq War.
Trump, unlike Carly Fiorina, would talk to Vladimir Putin. Unlike the departed Scott Walter, he would not tear up the Iran nuclear deal the day he took office. He would monitor and enforce it.
Unlike other Republican candidates, he does not look upon Putin's intervention on behalf of Assad with anger and outrage. If Putin wants to bomb ISIS, be my guest, says Trump.
Trump has not laid out a broad foreign policy. Yet, the sense one gets is that, like Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan, he is a "peace through strength" Republican who looks to extricate us from Mideast wars now underway, and not be looking to start any new ones.
For anti-interventionists, Trump vs. Sanders is the ideal race.

Destructive, inane shutdown drags on after talks hit a wall

With the partial government shutdown stretching into 2019, here's what you need to know about the effects. USA TODAY
Ideally, in return for the Democrats meeting Trump partway on border security, he'd agree to end his policy of threatening 'Dreamers': Our view

CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE
Like previous government shutdowns, the current one — which enters its 13th day on Thursday — has had less impact than you might expect. About two-thirds of government spending is for benefits such as Medicare and Social Security, which are unaffected by shutdowns. Also unaffected are the jobs of federal workers considered “essential.”
Lessening the impact even further, Congress did manage to pass a measure financing the Pentagon, the Department of Health and Human Services and several other large agencies.
None of this should obscure the fact that this shutdown is both destructive and inane, perhaps more so because Congress, President Donald Trump and even much of the American public seem inured to these periodic events.
The shutdown is affecting a number of loan programs from the Small Business Administration and other agencies. (Initially, it prevented the issuance of federal flood insurance policies, which are necessary for mortgages in many parts of the country, but the government has apparently found a workaround.) Smithsonian museums are shuttered, and national parks are a mess.
OPPOSING VIEW: Sensible border security justifies government shutdown
The proximate cause of the shutdown is a dispute over funding for Trump’s border wall, the one Mexico was supposed to pay for.
Physical barriers (though not concrete walls) are an important component of border security in certain places along the 2,000-mile border. But much of today's illegal immigration problem involves people who overstay their visas or who wish to be apprehended so they can apply for asylum or refugee status. Trump seemed to comprehend this when he initially signaled he would compromise. But he beat a hasty retreat when he started coming under attack from hard-line conservative pundits and power brokers.
Trump has been seeking $5 billion for the wall; Democrats have been offering $1.3 billion for border security. A deal in this case would not be difficult to envision, as the numbers involved are dwarfed by the $3.8 trillion budget.
Ideally, in return for the Democrats meeting him partway on border security, Trump would agree to end his policy of threatening “Dreamers” — young adults who were brought here illegally as children — with deportation once their court protection ends.
This fight over border funding, however, has larger overtones that might stand in the way of a quick resolution. Wednesday’s meeting at the White House with congressional leaders ended with no signs of progress.
Democrats, who take control of the House on Thursday, are happy to finally be in the position of being able to say no to Trump and want to display that power to their rank-and-file voters. They plan to offer a measure funding the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8 and the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Trump, meanwhile, has spent his first two years catering to his base and ignoring or insulting just about everyone else. He does not appear inclined to change that now.
This leaves much of the country wondering when this desultory fight over a relatively small matter will come to an end. From the looks of things, the answer is: not very soon.

John Hickenlooper: The Green New Deal sets us up for failure. We need a better approach.	
SAN DIEGO — The Rockies weren’t players. They were a band of Tom Sawyers.
Their death hasn’t exactly been exaggerated, but they have been witnessing their own funeral during the past month. No Rockies team has ever opened with seven straight one-run losses, each a shovelful of dirt on their potential casket.
“I still think we have a good team, but we have work to do,” manager Clint Hurdle said Monday. “We need to find a way when it comes to crunch time to make the good pitch, the good play, the good swing.”
Staring at a wrenching loss, Chris Iannetta provided the type of jolt capable of waking this team from its coma, smashing a seventh-inning grand slam in the Rockies’ 9-6 victory at Petco Park.
“We needed a game like this where we came from behind, found a way to win,” shortstop Troy Tulo-witzki said. “You could tell it was gone when the crowd all stood up.”
It is impossible to overstate the importance or impressiveness of the catcher’s hack. The Rockies were numb, frustrated and angry. They squandered a 5-3 lead, Jorge De La Rosa losing his temper after allowing a three-run home run to Scott Hairston. The left-hander erupted, throwing his arms in the air on contact before ultimately yelling expletives and kicking the dugout stairs.
That scene could have eloquently explained the season. But Iannetta photo-shopped it out with one swing. It went down like this. The Padres’ bullpen, made up of castoffs and unknowns, turned to a familiar name: Cla Meredith.
He practically won the National League West in 2006 with his setup work. That pitcher, compared loosely to Dan Quisenberry, no longer exists. Naked without his 92 mph fastball, the sidearmer tried to sneak an 86 mph heater past Iannetta.
The sound of the bat told the story. It was the baseball equivalent of Manny Pacquiao’s left hook to Ricky Hatton’s jaw. Replays of that fight brought oohs from Rockies players before the game. Iannetta’s 385-foot shot created a collective gasp from the intimate paid gathering of 14,717, smallest in San Diego this season.
It was the Rockies’ first grand slam of the season, coming on the anniversary of the franchise’s inaugural slam in 1993. Back then, the moments were a novelty. This shot was a necessity for a team that has spent the first month burying itself in the National League West.
That this game required nervy dramatics is hard to explain. De La Rosa managed to give up six runs despite allowing just three hits. Simply put, he maximized his mistakes. He committed his third error of the season on a third-inning sacrifice bunt. He’s tied for the Rockies’ lead among all players, and has more errors than 12 National League pitching staffs.
The gaffe led to three unearned runs. His last chance at his first victory since Sept. 25 vanished in the fifth.
With two runners aboard, De La Rosa served up a 92 mph fastball to Hairston that disappeared into the left-field seats. De La Rosa threw his arms in the air, wondering aloud at what he had done. In the dugout moments later, he struggled to compose himself.
That fury was soon forgotten because of Iannetta’s fist of power.
Troy E. Renck: 303-954-1301 or trenck@denverpost.com
Looking ahead
TODAY: Rockies at Padres, 8:05 p.m., FSN
Aaron Cook (1-1, 7.11 ERA) was a blast from the past in his most recent start, relying almost exclusively on a sinker that regained its dive. Cook was visibly encouraged by his win over the Padres, a team he has owned. There is nowhere the right-hander pitches better than at Petco Park, where he’s 5-1 with a 1.69 ERA. He hasn’t recorded the win in back-to-back starts since July 30. Josh Geer (0-0, 5.29) is a poor man’s Cook. He relies on a sinker, but lacks the velocity. Troy Tulowitzki, Chris Iannetta and Clint Barmes all have two hits against the right-hander.

Whether you jog 5 miles or walk 2 blocks, the InstaFire Pepper Spray Glove keeps you safe while giving you the free range of motion you want when exercising. It doesn't matter if it's a dog or an attacker, the 18% OC brings them to their knees, giving you time to get away. The spray also contains a UV Identifier to easily let the authorities know who you pepper sprayed. It's highly accurate and has been laboratory tested to spray up to 16 feet.
The InstaFire uses a tension-fabric polyester that ergonomically resists sweat and weather conditions like rain and snow. This allows air to quickly pass through the material, keeping the user's hand clean, dry and cool while providing a comfortable and active experience.
The pepper spray pocket is positioned to allow the quickest response time, while remaining comfortable and unnoticeable for workout carrying and use.
This 18% OC pepper spray is one of the hottest in the world. Laboratory tested and made in the U.S.A., a quick spray is enough to incapacitate any unwanted assailant to their feet. Each actuator doubles as a safety switch to prevent accidental discharge, yet easy enough to activate in a quick one-finger motion.
Features
This lightweight non-abrasive Comfort Polyester fabric stays dry to the weather on the outside and lets your hand breathe on the inside.
The super hot 18% OC Guard Dog pepper spray is held in place with a securely sewn in compartment to the palm of the self-defense glove.
The pepper spray pocket is positioned to allow the quickest response time, while remaining comfortable and unnoticeable for every day carrying and use.
Pepper spray shoots up to 16 feet
The UV identifier will make it easy for the police to identify your attacker, when you have gotten safely away and called 911.
Guard Dog Protected 4 Life Guarantee© ensures that your pepper spray will be replaced free for life in the event of use in an emergency.
Twist lock pepper spray so that you can “lock” it in the “off” position if you desire to do so.
Available in pink or black colors.

Dr. Baykal’s area of expertise includes biotribology, with an emphasis on wear testing of articular cartilage, hydrogels and polymers used in medical devices, such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK). His primary focus is on pin-on-disk testing. In his previous research, Dr. Baykal developed and implemented customized wear testing protocols for articular cartilage and hydrogels. He has experience with standards pertaining to wear testing of medical implants, biomaterials including polymeric and metallic materials (ASTM F732, ISO 14242 and 14243). He is trained on AMTI OrthoPOD pin-on-disk tester and AMTI knee wear tester. Dr. Baykal has also worked on evaluating matrix constituents of articular cartilage tissue. This work involved histology and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) including multivariate analysis, specifically partial least squares regression method. Dr. Baykal has extensive knowledge of biphasic cartilage models. He is proficient in Matlab, C++ and Xcode, and wrote an iPad app for clinical use.
Prior to joining Exponent, Dr. Baykal was a graduate researcher in the Implant Research Center at Drexel University. His research was the tribological assessment of hydrogels for replacing damaged articular cartilage. He is experienced in mechanical and friction testing, lubrication analysis, and biphasic material characterization.

‘Phenomenal’ new treatment could help to save thousands at risk of heart disease
A NEW daily treatment could slash the risk of heart disease patients dying from fatal attacks.

The tablet, when taken with aspirin, slashes the death rate for people with known heart conditions by 15 per cent. And it stops all attacks by 42 per cent, according to a global clinical trial.
The tests on rivaroxaban appear to show it could save nearly 25,000 lives a year in the UK alone.
The stunning findings have prompted scientists to halt tests 12 months early.

10 Step plan to eliminate your risk of heart disease
{% } %}
Dr Derek Connolly, a heart consultant involved in the UK element of the trial, said: “This is a phenomenal result and this treatment could save thousands of lives. Cardiovascular disease is still the number one killer and reducing mortality by 15 per cent means that millions of heart attacks and deaths across Europe can be avoided.

Dr Derek Connolly - Heart consultant
“This is a ground-breaking result.”
The twice-daily pill is taken with aspirin and the combination has had such a positive impact that the trial involving 27,000 patients was stopped one year ahead of schedule because the benefits were so large.
Dr Connolly, a consultant interventional cardiologist at Birmingham City Hospital, said the drug would help thousands of patients who suffer from coronary and peripheral artery disease.

Both conditions involve key arteries narrowing along with fatty deposits which elevates the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Aspirin is currently the most widely used treatment but it is only modestly effective.
Combining the drug with aspirin reduces the risk of potential lethal clots in blood and can be taken by people who have heart disease but have not had a recent problem.
The trial, across 33 countries, studied patients with an average age of 68 with established disease.
About 70 per cent of them were on beta-blockers and blood-pressure medication as well as aspirin.
It reported that taking rivaroxaban and aspirin could prevent 13 heart attacks, strokes or deaths and seven deaths from different conditions for every 1,000 patients. Cardiovascular disease causes 158,000 deaths a year in the UK.

Seven million people are living with the disease.
The drug, which is already used for other heart problems, will now be assessed by Nice, the Government’s regulatory body, before it is available on the NHS.
Last night Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: “This is a significant finding. However, the increased risk of internal bleeding for patients who take this medication must be considered when prescribing it.
"It’s also expensive, so unlikely to be offered to a lot of people initially.

George H.W. Bush funeral: Oak Ridge Boys, Reba McEntire pay tribute with classic songs

From former NBA players to actors, celebrities were seen arriving one-by-one to George H.W. Bush's funeral in Houston, Texas. USA TODAY
The Houston funeral for George H.W. Bush Thursday morning was marked with musical tributes from a couple of the late former president's favorite country music acts.
The Oak Ridge Boys
One of the members of the quartet, Duane Allen, recalled meeting Bush when he was vice president.
‘Boys, I’m a big fan of yours and … would you do a song or two for me because I’m a huge fan,'" Bush told them.
The Oak Ridge Boys said singing “Amazing Grace” at the service was an honor.
“What many don’t know is he considered himself a good bass singer," Allen said of the former president to a roar of laughter. "He was not.”
Reba McEntire
The Grammy Award-winning country singer sang "The Lord's Prayer" near the end of the service, often blinking back tears -- and drawing tears from the late president's son, George W. Bush.
McEntire was one of several country singers who posted about the former president after his death. In a Dec. 1 Instagram post, she shared a photo of herself and Bush, simply captioned: "My favorite."

St. Martin's Choir
Bush and his wife, Barbara, were members of St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston for more than 50 years, and the church's choir was featured as part of the service.
As the choir sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," George W. Bush was seen nodding along enthusiastically to the beat. The song even drew a smile to his face.
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic" appears to be one of Bush's favorite tunes. The former president's dance to the tune at a 2016 memorial service in Dallas previously went viral.

ACEEE researches CHP as a future energy grid resource
 By Corporate Waste Solutions  5 July 2017
Many US states are undertaking new approaches to utility planning that prioritise clean, distributed energy resources, but few are considering combined heat and power (CHP) for meeting the demands of the modern grid. In many ways, CHP provides exactly what they need.
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) is doing some of the first research to evaluate CHP as a grid resource. It is looking at it’s role as an alternative to traditional utility investments and as a support for broader adoption of distributed energy resources. Why now? Policymakers and planners are seeking efficient, low-cost resources that are highly reliable and flexible enough to support more distributed grid resources.
Why CHP can deliver what systems planners need
CHP is more than just an energy efficient method of generating electricity and thermal energy. It has the potential to deliver lower overall system costs, stronger critical infrastructure and improved grid reliability. It can also yield significantly fewer emissions than conventional power plants and support state-level economic development.
The benefits can be even greater depending on where CHP is located and how it is deployed. Most people typically think of it as providing base load capacity, generating electricity and thermal energy consistently throughout the day. In addition to providing an always-on source of power, modern combined heat and power systems are capable of acting as a more flexible resource, offering key grid-supporting services needed to maintain operations and help balance distribution. States and utilities that carefully consider these attributes of CHP in their resource plans are likely to find it’s a useful solution that minimises system costs and maximises customer benefits.
What’s the problem?
So far, CHP’s benefits remain undervalued. This situation partly explains why we have not come close to realising CHP’s potential for new deployment in the United States. For one, CHP has historically been at odds with the electric utility’s business model, because customers buy less electricity after it’s installed. Plus, most existing policies and utility regulations are not designed to allow utilities to monetise all of CHP’s value streams, such as increased reliability and reduced emissions. But the electricity industry is changing, and utilities and policymakers are beginning to broaden their view on how to meet future energy needs.
New research exploring CHP as a grid resource
Prior ACEEE research has documented the value CHP could bring to electric utilities if policies and regulations encouraged utility investments. This year, ACEEE is undertaking a new research project to explore how policymakers and system planners can better integrate CHP as a resource into future system planning.
Meegan Kelly, senior research analyst at ACEEE says, “We’re exploring how utilities can have a stake in financing, building and operating CHP themselves, using it to support greater integration of distributed energy resources in their service territories. Our goal is to highlight a vision for how to incorporate CHP into integrated resource planning or other long-term strategies, and to demonstrate CHP’s capabilities for meeting modern grid needs through real-world examples.
“When I imagine the future grid, I see CHP systems meeting onsite energy needs at universities, hospitals, multifamily buildings and industrial facilities,” Kelly says. “I envision them replacing and upgrading old grid infrastructure, minimising big investments in central power plants and supporting more distributed energy resources that provide clean power.”
Meegan Kelly is a senior research analyst at the ACEEE’s Industry Program.
The ACEEE acts as a catalyst to advance energy efficiency policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviours. For information about ACEEE and its programs, publications and conferences, visit aceee.org.

James Mattis, the new US defence secretary, has said the US commitment to Nato’s mutual defence clause “remains rock solid” under the Trump administration.
A day after he warned allies that the US will “moderate” its commitment to Nato if they do not intensify their defence expenditure, retired general Mattis said his intention in talks with defence ministers was to offer “full US commitment” to the organisation.
Gen Mattis declined to specify how Washington might moderate its support, saying “that is the headline I do not anticipate seeing” because he was confident that allies will increase defence spending.
Asked whether he believed Russia had interfered in the US election, he said only that “there is very little doubt that they have interfered or attempted to interfere in a number of elections in the democracies.”

Report Report: AI, Global Risks, Climate Governance and Circularity
Report Report
Report Report: AI, Global Risks, Climate Governance and Circularity
Devon Edwards
Wednesday, February 13, 2019 - 1:00am
GreenBiz Group
The Report Report is a monthly wrap-up of recent research on sustainable business and clean technology, produced by Corporate Eco Forum, a by-invitation membership organization comprised of large, global companies that demonstrate a serious commitment at the senior executive level to sustainability as a business strategy issue.
A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot (World Economic Forum and PACE) makes the case for a more circular electronics system that unlocks the full economic value of e-waste. The report outlines its vision and the changes needed to make this new vision a reality:
Vision: Society needs to collectively rethink the rules of the game and create a vision around which government, consumers and industry can rally.
Awareness: The public needs to learn more about this growing global challenge and opportunity.
Collaboration: This coalition seeks to work with multinationals, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), entrepreneurs, employers’ associations, academia, trade unions, civil society and associations in a specific and deliberative process to bring about change. Public-private collaborations through platforms such as PACE and the E-waste Coalition will play an important role.
Action: Coordinated action by all actors is needed within and across national borders.
Artificial Intelligence and the Circular Economy (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and Google) examines the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in two value chains: food and consumer electronics. The report finds that AI could unlock up to $127 billion annually for the food value chain by 2030 and up to $90 billion for consumer electronics.
Circularity Gap Report 2019 (Circle Economy) finds that the global economy is only 9 percent circular, meaning that just 9 percent of the 92.8 billion tons of extracted raw materials that enter the economy are re-used annually. The report also highlights three key circular strategies that could be adapted throughout the economy:
Optimizing the utility of products by maximizing their use and extending their lifetime.
Enhanced recycling, using waste as a resource.
Circular design, reducing material consumption and using lower-carbon alternatives.
Climatescope 2018 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) assesses clean energy investment and deployment activities across 103 developing countries around the world. Select key findings included:
In 2017, most of the world's new zero-carbon power capacity was built in developing countries. A total of 114GW was added in these nations, compared with about 63GW added in wealthier nations.
In a first, renewables accounted for the majority of all new power-generating capacity added. Developing countries added 186GW in 2017 to their grids, with wind and solar alone accounting for 94GW — just over half.
Clean energy deployment is growing fastest in developing nations. New-build additions rose 20.4 percent year-on-year in these countries. By contrast, new build in wealthier nations fell by 0.4 percent.
Chile was ranked as the most attractive emerging nation for clean energy investment, followed by India and Jordan.
Finance for Seafood in South East Asia (Global Canopy) assesses 24 of the largest regional and national banks across South East Asia on their efforts to manage risks associated with lending to seafood firms with negative environmental and social impacts. The report finds that no banks assessed have a sustainability policy on seafood in place to help manage these risks.
From Me to We: The Rise of the Purpose-led Brand (Accenture Strategy) analyzes survey responses from nearly 30,000 consumers globally to better understand what they expect from brands and companies. Key findings included:
62 percent of consumers globally want companies to take a stand on the social, cultural, environmental and political issues close to their hearts.
63 percent are buying goods and services from companies that reflect their personal values and beliefs.
62 percent of consumers say their purchasing consideration is driven by a company’s ethical values and authenticity.
74 percent crave greater transparency into how companies source their products, ensure safe working conditions, and their stance on important issues.
66 percent believe their actions can influence a company’s stance on issues of public concern.
47 percent have stopped doing business with a company as a result of its actions.
Global Risks Report 2019 (World Economic Forum and Marsh & McLennan Companies) assesses the impact and likelihood of 30 global economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological risks that could pose a significant threat to our global system over the next 10 years. The top 10 risks, in terms of likelihood and impact, include:
Global risks in terms of likelihood:
Extreme weather events
Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation
Natural disasters
Data fraud or theft
Cyber attacks
Man-made environmental disasters
Large-scale involuntary migration
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
Water crises
Asset bubbles in a major economy
Global risks in terms of impact:
Weapons of mass destruction
Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation
Extreme weather events
Water crises
Natural disasters
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse
Cyber attacks
Critical information infrastructure breakdown
Man-made environmental disasters
Spread of infectious diseases
How to Set Up Effective Climate Governance on Corporate Boards: Guiding Principles and Questions (World Economic Forum and PwC) presents eight climate governance principles to increase directors’ climate awareness, embed climate issues into board structures and processes, and improve navigation of the risks and opportunities that climate change poses to business.
Integrating Natural Capital in Risk Assessments: A Step-by-Step Guide for Banks (Natural Capital Finance Alliance and PwC) offers step-by step guidance to help financial institutions conduct a rapid natural capital risk assessment. The report guides users through two processes:
Rapid Natural Capital Risk Assessment, which allows an institution to quickly identify the areas of highest natural capital risk.
Sector/Asset Analysis, which uses location-specific environmental data to assess the likelihood and likely impact of disruption that businesses in their portfolios face due to environmental change. This notably could help financial institutions in their climate scenario analyses as recommended by the TCFD.
Investing in Society (The CEO Force for Good) explores how leading companies are aligning their corporate social investment strategies to solve the world’s most pressing issues. The report highlights company examples across five focus areas: priorities; performance; people; planet; and policies.
It’s Time to Plant the Seeds of Sustainable Growth in Agriculture (The Boston Consulting Group) highlights the opportunities for agribusiness companies to become central players in sustainable agriculture. The report calls on agribusiness to play a larger role in sustainable farming, become knowledge partners with their customers, drive innovation and technological solutions, improve crop yield and enhance the quality for food for people.
New Energy Solutions for 1.5 Degrees C: Pathways and Technologies to Achieve the Paris Agreement (WBCSD) provides viewpoints from WBCSD member companies on the developments and changes needed to enable an energy transition that aligns with the Paris Agreement. The report also identifies the current barriers and potential solutions to decarbonizing the power, transport, buildings and industry sectors.
State by State: An Analysis of U.S. Companies and Cities Across Seven States (CDP) examines how companies and cities in the United States react to climate change impacts across Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Texas. Key findings included:
88 percent of U.S. real estate companies cited operational risks related to hurricanes, flooding, storm surges and sea level rise.
Californian companies reported in 2017 more opportunities from environmental regulation than companies headquartered in any other state; 81 percent of Californian companies disclosing inherent benefits to their business from climate-related regulation.
In 2017, companies in the Southwest operating within the Colorado River Basin have reported more than 70 serious water risks to their operations and more than 70 percent of these risks were linked to expectations of higher operating costs and plant disruption.
Ohio-based companies consistently have reported fuel and energy regulation as a top risk since 2015.
In 2017, over 50 percent of Californian companies pointed to corporate reputation and changing consumer behaviors as drivers of business opportunities, with 69 percent reporting either or both drivers in their responses to CDP.

George P. Bush's tribute to his grandfather: The man I simply called 'Gampy'
George P. Bush, Corpus Christi Caller-Times Opinion Published 11:56 a.m. CT Dec. 6, 2018
In our times together, our big, wonderful and competitive family saw how George H. W. Bush's personal goodness led to his historical greatness.

The man I simply called "Gampy" was known to the world as George Herbert Walker Bush. And he was the most gracious, most decent and most humble man I will ever know. In fact, he would tell you how blessed he was and how thankful he was for each blessing.
My grandfather was thankful for his family.
He would wake up about 5 a.m. to review security briefings and grab his first coffee of the day. When the coast was clear, all of the grandkids would do our best to snag a spot on his bed with Ganny, while they read the paper.
We all grew up in awe of our grandfather — a larger-than-life figure fly-fishing off the rocks in Maine. He would be the first to host intense horseshoe matchups between family and secret service, or any willing head of state, while encouraging trash talk like "power outage" if you were short on your throw, or "Woodrow Wilson" if you were long. His typical spread included barbecue, tacos or pork rinds with hot sauce — of course with a healthy dose of Blue Bell ice cream. Always the competitor, each night closed with Gampy challenging us to the coveted "first asleep" award.

In classic Gampy fashion, he would write letters of encouragement — whether one of us had a hard semester at school, one of us (not me) drove his boat Fidelity into the rocks, or one of us (definitely not me) ended up in Ganny's crosshairs.
'Greatest of the greatest generation': Mourners remember President George H. W. Bush
At the close of one summer, after he had left public service, Gampy wrote an email to all of us:
The only thing wrong with the last five months is that none of you were here enough. Next year, promise this old gampster that you will spend more time with us here by the sea. As you know, I have had to give up fly-fishing off the rocks, but there is plenty left to do — plenty of wonderful things. I think of all of you an awful lot. I just wonder how each of you is doing — in life, in college, in school. If you need me, I am here for you, because I love you very much.

Jeb Bush, Henry Hager, Noelle Bush and Robert Koch. (Photo: Photo Eric Draper/Courtesy of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum)
In Psalm 91:16, God makes this promise: "With long life, I will satisfy him and show him my salvation." Today, we know that Gampy did enjoy a long life, and we know he is enjoying the beginning of his next life with my Ganny and his beloved Robin.
He was thankful to serve
My grandfather was thankful for his country.
My grandfather was grateful to lead a country where people can go as far, and as fast, as their dreams can take them; a country that celebrates individuals alone or working together to improve the condition of their fellow man on a voluntary basis — an initiative he would later describe as a "thousand points of light."
He often spoke about the timeless creed of "duty, honor, country" that has sustained the republic for more than 240 years.
Neil Bush: My father believed in service to others
Related: Understanding George H.W. Bush, one letter at a time
Our view: George H.W. Bush was a great American, class act and underrated president
But this wasn't something he just talked about ... it was something he lived. He flew 58 combat missions in the Pacific, was shot down and rescued at sea. Yet he never saw his own heroism as being any greater than anyone else's. I know this because I experienced it personally. Gampy was so proud when my cousin Walker joined the Marines and I joined the Navy, and he was even prouder when we served overseas. In no way did our service compare with his, yet we could never convince him of that.
In our times together, our big, wonderful and competitive family saw his personal goodness that led to his historical greatness. He left a simple yet profound legacy to his children and grandchildren and to our great country — service to others. When the last word on George H.W. Bush is written, it will almost certainly be this: The fulfillment of a complete life cannot be achieved without service to others.
He was thankful to God
Finally, my grandfather was thankful for his God.
Gampy once said: "God is good, but his love has a cost: We must be good to one another." It was his faith and his love for others that drove him, that fulfilled him, and that led him to a calling in public life.
Toward the end of his service as president, at a prayer breakfast here in Houston, he reflected on his time aboard the submarine USS Finback after being shot down during World War II — he went up topside one night on the deck, stood watch and looked out at the dark. He said: "The sky was clear; the stars were brilliant like a blizzard of fireflies in the night. There was a calm inner peace. Halfway around the world in a war zone, there was a calm inner peace: God's therapy."
Today, after 94 years, the heavy hand of time has claimed the life of my Gamps. But in death, as in life, my grandfather has won — for he has exchanged his earthly burdens for a heavenly home and is at peace.
Yes, the man I simply called Gampy was the most gracious, most decent and most humble man I will ever know. And it's the honor of a lifetime to share his name.
God bless you, Gampy. Until we meet again.

New Mexico enrolls 103K in Medicaid since October
updated Wed March 19, 2014
by Barry Massey, Associated Press
About 103,000 low-income New Mexicans have enrolled in Medicaid since the state expanded who qualifies for the health care program, according to the latest figures from Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration.
The state opened enrollment in October and medical services started for new recipients in January. With the expansion, Medicaid provides health care for nearly 30 percent of the state’s population.
Human Services Department spokesman Matt Kennicott said the pace of enrollment suggests that the agency will meet or exceed its projections that about 130,000 low-income adults will gain medical coverage during the first year of the Medicaid expansion.
The federal government initially is covering the cost of health care for those who enroll.
New Mexico has among the highest uninsured rates in the nation, with nearly one in five of its residents lacking medical coverage
Under new Medicaid guidelines, an adult with two children can qualify for Medicaid with earnings of about $27,300 a year. That’s roughly 138 percent of the federal poverty level.
In the past, Medicaid mostly served children in lower-income families, pregnant women, elderly adults in nursing homes and some disabled people.
The Medicaid expansion was provided for under the federal health care overhaul law that also allows uninsured individuals — those who don’t qualify for Medicaid — to buy medical insurance from private insurers through an online marketplace.
The growth of Medicaid has been much greater than health coverage enrollment through the exchange. About 15,000 New Mexicans have signed up for health insurance plans through a federally operated exchange from October through February.
The federal exchange was plagued with technical problems at the outset that made it difficult for consumers to use.
New Mexico is initially relying on a federal exchange website for enrolling individuals. A state-run exchange allows small businesses to offer insurance coverage to employees.
The state exchange initially had expected about 80,000 new individuals to sign up for health plans in the first year, but that goal has been rolled back to 40,000 to 50,000 by the end of the year.
There’s no deadline for enrolling in Medicaid, but March 31 is the last day to sign up for a potentially subsidized health plan through the online exchange. New Mexico exchange officials hope to see as many as 40,000 individuals enrolled by the end of the month or if the enrollment period is extended, according to exchange spokeswoman Debra Hammer.
She said the state exchange plans to start handling open enrollment for individuals in October for coverage that will start in 2015.
Kennicott said about 60,000 of the newly enrolled Medicaid recipients are individuals who previously had received limited health care through other state programs — one that had served the working poor and the other offering family planning services. In the shift to the expanded Medicaid program, those individuals receive a broader range of medical benefits.
A majority of those who’ve signed up for Medicaid enrolled at one of the department’s Income Support Offices throughout the state, according to Kennicott. The state also has a website and telephone hotline that can assist with enrollment.

Guatemalan Kidnapping / American Adoption: The Karen Monahan Story
12/09/2014 04:57 pm ET Updated Dec 06, 2017
Karen Abigail Monahan is ten years old and lives with her mom and dad, Jennifer and Timothy Monahan, in Liberty, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City. She is likely in the fifth grade and undoubtedly knows that she was adopted from Guatemala.
Someday soon, this little girl will sit at a computer and type her own name, or that of her parents, into a search engine and find a tale of mystery, intrigue and an international child trafficking scandal that contributed to the end of American adoptions from Guatemala.
Karen will discover that it is believed she was born Anyelí Liseth Hernández Rodríguez to Loyda Rodriguez and her husband, Dayner Hernández, a middleclass couple from Guatemala, who had two other children (Karen/Anyeli's full brother and sister) at the time she was born and abducted. She will find pictures of herself and photos of her tearful Guatemalan mother, who along with her father, immediately and repeatedly reported that their child was abducted from the front yard of their home on November 3, 2006. She will discover that the Guatemalan government determined after extensive investigation that she was kidnapped from her family and that her visa was issued illegally when she was brought to America in 2008.
Her mother, Loyda, she may discover, took part in a hunger strike to bring attention to her case and to other kidnappings perpetrated to create adoptions from Guatemala, and neither her mother nor her father ever stopped trying to have her returned, or at the very least, to see her.
Will seeing headlines like this and reading the stories like this make her feel as one would feel seeing oneself on a milk carton? Will she have been told, or perhaps heard, rumors at school or around town? She was four when she came to America. Will she have any childhood memories that will be triggered by seeing her baby pictures?
If Karen/Anyeli doesn't uncover the story as a curious teen, she likely will as a young adult when she applies for a driver's license with post-911 restrictions in place. Karen's American-issued amended birth certificate - like that of all adoptees - will indicate that she was born to her adoptive parents. The filing date on her U.S. birth certificate, however, will be four years subsequent to her birth, when she was adopted and came to America. The delay in filing date raises red flags for adoptees.
In her case, there is no telling what will happen next being that her Guatemalan birth certificate and passport were nullified. She may never be able to obtain a passport and thus would not be able to travel to her country of birth, or visit her Guatemalan family, and return.
The Guatemala government is demanding her return, and the U.S. government has responded with silence. In violation of international treaties, The State Department has failed to insist on DNA tests to prove or disprove the kidnapping allegations.
Karen/Anyeli will be able to read the details of her case in many online accounts, including most recently, "The Limits of Jurisdiction" by Erin Siegal McIntyre, who combed "over five thousand documents obtained and leaked from various sources in Guatemala, interviewed dozens of parties, and gained insight from criminal investigators and experts associated with the case in both countries."
She will learn that her American adoptive parents found her through Florida adoption agency Celebrate Children International (CCI) and were aware of problems from the very start, and that the person who claimed to be Anyeli's Guatemalan mother turned out not to exist. She will learn that:
"Loyda Rodríguez's DNA was compared to the DNA sample kept on file for Karen, drawn in July 2007. Two independent labs, one in Spain and one in the US, sent their findings back to Guatemala. Both agreed: Rodríguez and 'Karen' tested 99.98% positive for a maternal match."
The Monahans were told to let it go and try to adopt another child. But they loved her by then and feared if they didn't continue despite the red flags, that she would languish in foster care, or worse. In order to make it happen, American adoption attorneys and Guatemalan lawyer Susana Luarca Saracho, had the two-year-old declared abandoned, and the adoption proceeded despite irregularities and police reports of her kidnapping.
"The case," says McIntyre "pits American against Guatemalan interests, a family against a family. It can be seen as a study in the failure of cooperation and international diplomacy, or as an examination of influence, wealth, and power. The situation forces questions about the definitions of what is right, what is moral, and what, exactly, is criminal."
Reading the strange odyssey, Karen/Anyeli will discover that nearly a dozen Guatemalans, including government officials, have been charged with serious criminal offenses related to her adoption, including dereliction of duty, human trafficking, and falsifying documents. Two women, a nursery director and a lawyer, have been found guilty and are serving jail time for their involvement with this case.
While Karen/Anyeli's adoptive parents and the U.S. government ignore the controversy and illegalities surrounding her adoption, it remains to be seen how learning about it, which seems inevitable given the news coverage, will affect the child at the center of it. Will she want to meet the family she was taken from, who has loved her, fought for her, and longs to see her? Will she understand why her adoptive parents did not cooperate with the Guatemalan government or the parents she was stolen from?
One wonders, too, how Timothy and Jennifer Monahan continue to justify hiding behind their attorneys and PR firms, ignoring the pleas of Loyda Rodriguez to see her daughter. One wonders if they live in fear of allowing visitation between the child and her kin, terrified, ironically, that Loyda would kidnap her own child back.
Another American mother, also named Jennifer, faced with a Guatemalan adoption that raised suspicions, chose to blow the whistle on the baby brokers. In doing so, Jennifer Hemsley forfeited her own desire to mother the child she had bonded with, but she did not abandon the child. Hemsley continues to pay for the child's foster care and private schooling in Guatemala. Hemsley shared with me that "it's profoundly sad to not be with her every day", and to just visit and see her grow up in pictures; but, she says, "It's not about me. It's always been about her." Hemsley wrote:
"The children who are torn from the only mother and father they know, who are deprived of their truthful origins and original family...may suffer tragic consequences far into the future...."
She believes most who adopt enter into the process with the best intentions and with trust in the agencies, facilitators, and attorneys, as well as "the US government and other entities, to monitor the safeguards established to protect the system from corruption. But the system failed...
"In Guatemala, despite being known for issues of impunity and a weak judicial system, there have been arrests, sentences and imprisonments. But in the US, there has been no justice and no accountability. Those that profited millions through illicit adoptions and outright kidnapping enjoy the fruits of their crimes with no laws or regulations in place to hold them accountable."

Commentary on American Academy of Pediatrics 2012 Circumcision Policy Statement

By the staff of Doctors Opposing Circumcision
Doctors Opposing Circumcision has reviewed the two-page American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2012 Circumcision Policy Statement1 and the accompanying thirty-page electronically-published “technical report” entitled Male Circumcision.2 The Circumcision Policy Statement was created by an internal “Task Force on Circumcision,” appointed in 2007. No non-MD individuals were apparently invited to participate. The private deliberations of the Task Force have not been made public in any form. Indeed, the American Academy of Pediatrics is a physicians’ trade organization, whose focus is protecting the craft boundaries of pediatrics, and the income and continuing professional well-being of its members. The 2012 Task Force on Circumcision’ included the following members:
· Susan Blank, MD, MPD, chair of the Task Force, an infectious disease specialist, who has a well-documented religio-cultural bias in favor of male circumcision.
· Andrew Freedman, MD, a pediatric urologist, who has reported that he circumcised his own son on a kitchen table, for religio-cultural reasons, and who derives twenty percent of his practice from treating boys for circumcision-generated problems;
· Douglas Diekema, MD, an AAP bioethicist, who twice — first in 1996 and again in 2010, — on behalf of the AAP, proposed a billable “ritual nick” to the genitals of female children, despite the existence of international and U.S. federal law forbidding this practice;3 and,
· Steven Wegner, MD, JD, a doctor-lawyer, who serves on the AAP Committee on Health Care Financing, whose presumed focus in this instance was on the circumcision income flow, over $1.25 billion, annually —$2.25 billion or more if circumcision could be made mandatory or universally subsidized by Medicaid.
It is abundantly clear that the members of the task force were chosen with a view to obtaining an outcome favorable for the continued practice of circumcision of American male children and to provide for third-party payment to physician and hospital providers.
The task force was augmented by representatives from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, representing the two other trade associations —in addition to the AAP, itself — which profit most from performing medically unnecessary non-therapeutic circumcisions on children.
The task force, without irony, termed itself and these additional trade associations, “stakeholders”(p. 585 and p. e756). Stakeholders are commonly understood to be institutions and individuals with a financial interest in an enterprise. And indeed, when all revenue sources are considered, medically unnecessary, non-therapeutic circumcision produces more than US$1.25 billion in income annually for these ‘stakeholders.’4
It is a safe guess that no member of the task force had a foreskin or was partnered with anyone who did. No ‘ombudsman’ for children was invited to offer a devil’s advocate defense of the advantages of healthy, highly evolved, intact male anatomy of the sort Europeans, Asians, and many others know well.
The task force asserts that current evidence shows that the health benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks. The task force failed, however, to produce any sort of analysis to support that claim. Previously available cost-benefit studies do not support that conclusion.5,6,7,8 Moreover, even the task force freely admitted that, “The true incidence of complications after newborn circumcision is unknown…”9
It is difficult to countenance how the task force could blithely tout the ‘health benefits’ vs. risks and harms of circumcision while admitting the incidence of morbidity is ‘unknown.’ Complications, short-term and long, are the very important numerator of that equation.
No information on nature and function of the foreskin
Male circumcision is an extensive and intrusive operation that irreversibly excises and amputates a healthy, functional, male body part. The foreskin or prepuce of the penis constitutes more than fifty percent of the skin and mucosa of the penis, and in the intact adult, measures approximately 15 square inches, or 90 square cms of surface area.10 The foreskin is a complex structure containing smooth muscle, extensive vascular structures and specialized nerve endings. It has numerous protective, immunological, mechanical, sensory, and sexual physiological functions.11,12 The Task Force, however, makes absolutely no mention of the nature or function of the foreskin, although this information is of great relevance to making a decision regarding its loss to circumcision, and detailed information on the basic anatomy is readily available in the medical literature.
Rights of the child
It is well established in both domestic law and international human rights law that a child is a distinct and singular person with rights of his own from the moment of birth. The task force, however, treated the child-patient as a non-person with no legal rights of his own. There was no discussion of the child’s right to bodily integrity13 or the child’s right to security of his person and special protection during childhood,14 which rights nontherapeutic circumcision clearly violates. There was no mention of what the child might be presumed to prefer. The task force, instead, treated the child as a chattel possession of the parents, one with which they can do whatever they please in this regard. The AAP has failed to understand that domestic and international laws for the protection of individuals are written for the protection of the best interests of those individuals and that the violation of those laws cannot be in the child’s best interest.
Medical Ethics
Although the section on medical ethics is much expanded from the previous statement of 1999,15 it still suffers the same faults. Infants and children cannot consent, so surrogate consent for child circumcision must be adduced from parents or guardians. Although the task force statement quotes from the statement on consent, it omits the section that limits the consent power of the surrogate:
Only patients who have appropriate decisional capacity and legal empowerment can give their informed consent to medical care. In all other situations, parents or other surrogates provide informed permission for diagnosis and treatment of children with the assent of the child whenever appropriate.16
Since the typical infant circumcision is non-therapeutic, and constitutes neither diagnosis nor necessary treatment, this section would prohibit parental consent on its face. The task force ignored this caution. It appears that no one has the power to consent to nontherapeutic excision of healthy body tissue from a child. This has also been the conclusion of appellate courts in Canada,17 Australia,18 and Germany.19
This task force relied, as did the previous task force, on a paper by Fleischman et al. (1994) on caring for gravely ill children.20 This paper is totally inappropriate and inapplicable to the care of healthy children who do not need treatment.
The Task Force consistently defends and asserts parental cosmetic whims and cultural preferences, while ignoring the more fundamental rights of the child. It is clear from reading the task force’s distortion of medical ethics that the protection and preservation of ritual circumcision –as an unfettered parental option– is a continuing preoccupation of the AAP.
Use and misuse of medical literature
Due to the emotional issues created by involuntary amputation of part of the male phallus,21,22 the medical literature has been described as “voluminous, argumentative, polemical, confusing, chaotic, and contradictory.”23 For this reason, references can be found to support either side of any argument, and even lengthy documents on the subject can appear highly authoritative by the mere quantity of footnotes, while remaining highly selective.
The AAP task force examined medical literature published from 1995 to 2010. By doing this they excluded important articles unfavorable to male circumcision that were published before 1995 or after 2010. The task force then selectively cherry-picked the medical literature to support its predetermined position that male circumcision has health benefits. Much of the chosen medical literature was produced by a team from the pro-circumcision Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is funded by Michael Bloomberg, the well-known billionaire and mayor of New York City in 2012.
Sexually transmitted disease
The task force claims that male circumcision reduces STD infection by forty to sixty percent. The task force frequently used unreliable studies from Africa that may not be applicable to the United States, many of which were produced by the pro-circumcision Bloomberg group.24,25
American studies that do not confirm to the task force hypothesis (that the foreskin contributes to STD infection) were ignored. Van Howe (1999) wrote in his systematic review, “In summary, the medical literature does not support the theory that circumcision prevents STDs.”26
A longitudinal study of a birth cohort in Dunedin, New Zealand found little difference in STDs in circumcised and intact males.27
Human immunodeficiency virus
The decision to create a new AAP task force to update their circumcision policy position of 1999, was based on the publication in 2005 and 2007 of three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) carried out in Africa. The three studies purported to conclude that male circumcision provided a 60 percent reduction in female-to-male heterosexual transmission of HIV. Since 2007 a substantial number of papers have been published that debunk, delimit, or narrow the claims of the three RCTs.28,29,30,31,32,33 The task force totally ignored these important papers.
Recent evidence shows higher rates of HIV infection among circumcised men as compared to non-circumcised men in numerous populations. However, the task force did not choose to report this information.
The three RCTs, even if they are correct, studied HIV transmission among adults in Africa. Any conclusions to be drawn about African adult sexual behavior and inappropriate or inadequate sexual hygiene are not readily applicable to infants and children in North America, who will have access to clean water and proper hygiene at their sexual debut.
Urinary tract infection (UTI)
The 2012 task force, in its zeal to promote male circumcision, has resurrected the myth that 1% of boys who are not circumcised are subject to a UTI in the first year of life. This claim was even partially debunked by their own predecessor 1999 task force.34
Furthermore, Chessare (1992) showed that even if the claims about UTI were correct, the complications from circumcision exceed the benefits from prevention of UTI.35 (The task force chose to arbitrarily exclude this significant paper because it was written in 1992.)
At the annual AAP convention in New Orleans in October, 2012, a urologist presenter, when questioned on the record, freely admitted that the thirty-year-old claimed 1% absolute rate of UTI in intact boys could easily be ascribed to “unnecessary, intrusive, and septic genital tampering.”
The best way to prevent UTI is breastfeeding, a fact well known to the AAP,36 but the task force chose not to divulge this information to the public, apparently preferring to promote male circumcision rather than easier methods of UTI prophylaxis.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)
The task force on circumcision proposes that male infants should be circumcised to protect adult women from BV. This is a ludicrous suggestion at best.
Studies that suggest male circumcision prevents BV were carried out in Africa and may not be relevant to North America. One study was authored by known pro-circumcision doctors associated with the Bloomberg School of Public Health,37 so it is likely to suffer from researcher bias. The other study found that racial differences, cigarette smoking, lack of vaginal H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and anal intercourse before vaginal intercourse were confounding factors.38 The science that supports the BV claim is extremely dubious at best.
Even if the science were indisputable, it is not clear that amputation of a body part from a child to protect an unrelated and unknown adult is in the child’s best long-term interest or even ethical. Bioethicists condemn the cutting of one healthy body without consent to prevent future disease — maybe — in an unidentified and unknowable other. The task force on circumcision has not provided any evidence that a surgical excision operation of a healthy functional body part from a child to help an unknown adult is in any child’s best interest, or meets modern epidemiological or bioethical standards.
In a few cases, organ removal has been found to be in the best interest of the child, if the organ removal is to save the life an immediate family member; however, that is not the case here. Parents may not grant surrogate consent to surgery unless it is the best interest of the incompetent child-patient himself, and no other, and such motivation does not include humoring the felt-needs and whims of the child’s birth family and relatives.39
Sexual function and sensation
The task force relied upon dubious sexual sensation studies carried out in Africa by pro-circumcision researchers,40,41 studies that did not study the foreskin,42,43 and an unreliable telephone survey from Australia.44
The task force ignored significant findings that did not meet their objective. Solinis and Yiannaki (2007) studied couples and reported: There was a decrease in couple’s sexual life after circumcision indicating that adult circumcision adversely affects sexual function in many men or/and their partners, possibly because of complications of surgery and loss of nerve endings.45 Frisch et al. (2011) reported: Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfillment. Thorough examination of these matters in areas where male circumcision is more common is warranted.46 Taylor (2007) speculated that the ridged band of the foreskin regulated the bulbocavernosus reflex.47 Podnar (2012) found that it is difficult to elicit the bulbo-cavernosus reflex (now called the penilo-cavernosus reflex) in circumcised men.48 The task force, inadvertently or intentionally, declined to elaborate upon and withheld from the American public, significant information on the effect of circumcision on sexual function.
Lack of knowledge of the foreskin
The task force has displayed an appalling lack of knowledge of the human foreskin. This may not be surprising because it appears that not one of the task force members possessed or had intimate knowledge of this normal and natural body part. The task force falsely claimed (citing Camille et al. 2002) that “adhesions (actually a normal protective membrane of childhood) present at birth, spontaneously dissolve by age 2 to 4 months” (p. 763). However Camille et al. actually said no such thing.49 Øster (1968) proved that the common connective epithelium of glans and foreskin breaks down slowly over a widely variable period of years and might endure, harmlessly, to age 17 years. The mean age of full and non-traumatic foreskin retraction, by study of a large cohort, has been set at 10.4 YEARS, and a similar timeline has been observed by numerous confirming studies. For the AAP task force to suggest otherwise is an atrocious misstatement of fundamental gross anatomy which has been understood for centuries. It does more than cast doubt on the medical competency of the AAP task force. It provides unfortunate fodder for clinicians to claim a birth defect when millions of healthy boys each year present with fully normal, still developing, penile anatomy.
The task force says, in addition, that penile wetness (subpreputial moisture) is “considered a marker for poor hygiene and is more prevalent in uncircumcised men than in circumcised men.” In actuality, sub-preputial moisture is completely normal in the intact male,50 and contains lyzozyme and other immune-active and protective substances.51 This ‘moisture’ is similar in function and protection in both genders. As one medical malpractice lawyer has exclaimed, “[i]f they are wrong about this, what else are they wrong about?”
It’s all about the money
The AAP has been concerned about state Medicaid agencies denying payment for unnecessary circumcision because its doctors receive less money. The protection of the source of funding is so important to the AAP that a section on financing newborn circumcision by third-party payers has been included in this medical position statement. A careful reading of this 2012 Circumcision Policy Statement shows that the task force was created five years ago with the transparent intention of using fear of HIV infection to make infant circumcision nearly universal in the United States. If this happened, the medical industry’s income from circumcision of an additional one million boys would jump from about $1.25 billion to about $2.25 billion. The AAP, ACOG, and AAFP apparently saw HIV infection prevention as the way to make this happen.
Unfortunately for their scheme, the three African RCTs have been debunked in the five years that have elapsed since the formation of the task force. One apparent purpose for this statement is to re-energize taxpayer-funded Medicaid to allow payment to doctors who perform non-therapeutic, unnecessary circumcisions once again, although it has been argued persuasively that it is unlawful to use Medicaid to pay for unnecessary, elective cosmetic surgery like circumcision.52 To increase the income of their members (whom the AAP call ‘fellows’), these medical associations are willing to put healthy American boys under the circumcision knife and expose them all to the risks of any surgery, and the unique risks, harms, and losses of circumcision itself.
Conclusion
The 2012 Circumcision Policy Statement was created by a team put together for the specific purpose of protecting the goose that lays golden eggs for the American medical industry. None of the members had any specific expertise in circumcision and their document suggests they knew little or nothing about the anatomy and utility of the human foreskin. They claimed to have studied voluminous literature, but ignored older and more useful studies, and cherry –picked the medical oeuvre. The advice given by this Circumcision Policy Statement is designed to support the continuation of an income stream for its stakeholders and also to protect ritual circumcision, by misapplication of ethical and legal rules for therapeutic operations to a non-therapeutic procedure, and distortion and misstatement of acknowledged clinical findings. The American Academy of Pediatrics – and more importantly the vulnerable children they claim to protect – would have been better served had the task force been fully neutral. Rather than choosing individuals with ethnic, religious, financial, professional, and even psychological motives to continue the practice of circumcision, a better choice would have been an unpaid group of volunteers, with no financial or cultural stake in the procedure. A task force composed of Europeans, some medically trained and some not, from historically non-circumcising cultures, would have been much more scientifically honest and ultimately more credible. This the AAP failed to do. The Canadian Paediatric Society,53 the British Medical Association,54 the Royal Dutch Medical Association,55 and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians56 have issued statements that stand in stark opposition to this new position of the AAP. It cannot be claimed that American male infant genitals are in unique need of urgent surgical reduction, while the children of other nations, where circumcision is uncommon, was never adopted, or has been fully abandoned, are doing just fine. Parents should be aware that the so-called medical information in the AAP Circumcision Policy Statement is fully tainted by easily identified conflicts-of-interest and financial motives. Government and insurance company officials should be aware that the claims of this statement are designed to protect third-party payment and should not be considered genuine –or even honest– medical advice. The American public should have none of this. They should reject the 2012 AAP Circumcision Policy Statement outright, and avoid any medical professional who advises them by quoting the tainted task force claims. The American Academy of Pediatrics has transparently overplayed its hand and should repudiate this travesty of a medical pronouncement immediately, before the Academy loses any more of its lingering — and endangered — bioethical credibility.

There are no good guys in Andrew Dominik’s “Killing Them Softly,” only people caught on two sides of a rough deal. The director’s gritty, violent and heavily stylized adaptation of George V. Higgins’ 1974 crime novel updates the story to recession-era 2008 and overstates it to the extreme, but Dominik brings a sleek pulp sensibility to the material and melds its topicality to a strange form of scathingly anti-capitalist entertainment.
“Cogan” is Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), a merciless hitman assigned to knock off various players involved in robbing a Boston poker game filled with mobsters. But the movie takes its time getting there, spending its first act entirely in the frantic realm of the bottom-feeders involved in the initial theft: Frankie (Scoot McNairy, “Monsters”), a weak-kneed small-time crook hired by scheming thug Johnny (Vincent Curatola) alongside clueless junkie Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to pull off a seemingly foolproof robbery that strategically positions another mobster, Markie (Ray Liotta), as the fall guy. The gig goes off without a hitch until Cogan enters the scene, hired by an unnamed mob representative (Richard Jenkins) to take care of everyone involved.
So he does. “Killing Them Softly” has a fairly minimal plot line, inching toward its inevitable series of murders with the same deceptively simple premise found in Dominik’s “The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford,” which spoiled the ending right in the title. But both movies are essentially tone poems that use narrative to prop up various attitudes and moods. The sense of alienation in “Jesse James,” invariably seen as influenced by Terrence Malick, takes on a more polemic dimension here; Dominik bathes each scene in cynicism. The screenplay is a treatise on why the tough guys always win in a society invariably set against itself. He has constructed a provocative revisionist history that beats the original Obama election message of hope and progress to a bloody mass.
The movie isn’t political so much as philosophical, trashing the notion of the American dream as anything more than fodder for an endless rat race. All the rhetoric bleeds together: “This is an extraordinary period for America’s economy,” President Bush says from a television in the background while the heist takes place. “This moment is our chance,” Obama asserts in the opening minutes, as Frankie wanders through a decrepit street.
Over time, these reminders of the election season grow tedious, but Dominik barrels forward with absolute conviction, resulting in a constant tension between extraordinary filmmaking technique and a transparent screenplay rarely capable of keeping pace. As with “Jesse James,” this is a truly cinematic work that could accomplish its fundamental appeal with the volume off. Primarily composed of close-ups, smooth tracing shots and whispery conversations about the hierarchy of the killing business, the movie derives its disquieting style from Cogan’s mentality, which also supplies the title: “I like to kill ’em softly, from a distance,” he says.
His empathy manifests in broad strokes. An occasionally overdone soundtrack props up most scenes; Russell shoots up to The Velvet Underground’s “Heroin” and Johnny Cash’s “The Man Comes Around” announces Jackie’s initial appearance. Classic jazz tunes underscore two of the more graphic scenes in this constant quest to uncover the poetry in mayhem. It only works if you give in to its intense determination.
There’s an amusement factor in Dominik’s attempts to define Jackie as a no-nonsense man for a time dominated by economic nonsense. However, “Killing Them Softly” owes a lot to the investment of its cast; Pitt delivers a run-of-the-mill scowling tough guy, but then that’s what the material calls for him to do; James Gandolfini, as a hitman colleague past his breaking point and unable to stay in the game, brings the most colorful and amusing moments. Both he and Liotta, some of the more typecast actors working today, manage to make roles we’ve seen them do before feel fresh by making their characters look surprisingly pathetic.
Like the rest of “Killing Them Softly,” the cast is positioned in blatant symbolic terms. By the time Jackie explains the “corporate mentality” of the killing process, Dominik has made made his intentions so clear that they nearly collapse. The final scene takes place on election night — and, of course, Obama’s victory speech plays a key role in Jackie’s closing monologue, which also focuses on the tenuous myth of (ulp) Thomas Jefferson. It’s the ultimate expression of the movie’s strengths and weaknesses combined, rendering the “Yes we can” chant in brutally ironic terms.
Criticwire grade: B+
HOW WILL IT PLAY? A tough sell for The Weinstein Company, given that Brad Pitt has been an uncertain proposition at the box office these days, and the movie is bound to divide critics. Dominik’s arty style didn’t do much for “Jesse James” at the box office, although the genre element of “Killing Them Softly” should give it a leg up for its first week or so when it opens later this year.

Climate Change May Turn The Arctic From White To Green
News
Tara Dodrill
Global warming will turn the Arctic from white to green if the Nature Climate Change journal findings are accurate. The new study maintains that green areas in the region could increase by up to 50 percent in the next several decades.
The climate change report also claims that the Arctic could support more plants and see growth at altitudes much higher than are currently possible. The researchers also believe the global warming in the cold climate will have an impact on the rest of the world. The new “color scheme” will attract and absorb more of the sun’s heat. The Albedo effect reportedly means that more energy stemming from the sun will be absorbed in the Arctic region.
As the global warming study stated, the light color of the snow and ice in the sea have a higher albedo. Such geographical features are light in color and reflect the sun’s energy back to space and enhance the coolness of the climate.
If the Arctic turns green in several decades like the study suggests, the lower albedo of shrubs, plants, and trees absorb light to a greater degree and will reportedly warm the environment around them.
A stated released by Woods Hole Research Center climate change expert Scott Goetz reads:
“These impacts would extend far beyond the Arctic region. For example, some species of birds seasonally migrate from lower latitudes and rely on finding particular polar habitats, such as open space for ground-nesting.”
Goetz also believes that the overall impact of the greening of the Arctic would be positive. The climate change researcher also thinks the region will experience greater warming than has been predicted. Areas the global warming study says will become greener in just a few decades includes far-north Canada, Alaska, and Siberia.

November 1st is traditionally known as “All Saints’ Day” in the Western Christian calendar--a day to remember all of the faithful departed. The day (eve) before All Saints’ Day was “All Hallows’ (an older word for “saint) Eve.” Later, in a series of twists and turns (more reminiscent of the latest TV sitcom, rather than “normal” history) this Christian holiday devolved into our contemporary Halloween.
What is less known about this day is that it marks the moment an obscure German monk and college professor presented a list of religious concerns for a formal debate, unwittingly sparking one of the most momentous events in Western history--the Reformation.
Many in the conservative Protestant tradition resonate with Martin Luther’s bold stand to proclaim the truths of the Bible, and to resist the authoritarian forces of control. But what they forget are the true aims of Luther and the first generation of reformers.
Martin Luther did not mean to start the Reformation. As a “doctor” of theology, he was trying to start an academic discussion about common church practices, such as “indulgence preachers,” who were basically selling get-out-of-Purgatory-free cards. He initially had no intention of breaking ties with the Roman Catholic church.
Many factors led to what we now call the “Reformation.” The first was the rediscovery of Biblical Greek and Hebrew. Most of the Reformers were serious students of these languages, and the insights they gained from this Scriptural engagement fueled the momentous changes that many celebrate on Oct. 31.
The second factor was the cultural movement we call the “Renaissance.” At its most basic level, the Renaissance looked back to the artistic and literary achievements of ancient Greece and Rome. Cultural life blossomed, spawning artists such as da Vinci and Michelangelo, composers such as Palestrina, and authors such as Dante Alighieri. In northern Europe, the Renaissance took a more “bookish” turn. Sparked by Johannes Gutenberg’s invention of the movable-type printing press, northern Europeans could suddenly produce and exchange ideas quickly through the printed word. Towns like Basel in Switzerland became centers of scholarship and book-production. Erasmus of Rotterdam led this movement through his scholarship and his wit. With biting satire and vast learning, Erasmus criticized the many moral and spiritual failings of the Catholic Church.
However, in the ensuing conflict, Erasmus remained loyal to the Roman church, unlike many of his protégés. Johannes Oecolampadius worked closely with Erasmus in Basel, putting together the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament, as well as new editions of classic Christian thinkers and pastors like Gregory of Nyssa, John Chrysostom, and Basil of Caesarea. As Oecolampadius dove deeper into the original Greek and Hebrew of the Bible, he joined the ranks of the Reformers. Eventually, their devotion to God’s Word led them into sustained conflict with Roman church officials, and finally into a full-fledged “Reformation.”
These Reformers shared the goal of returning the church to a purity and fervency that they read about in the New Testament (in the original Greek) and in the church fathers (many of whom wrote in Greek). They did not want to reject all of previous church history—they saw themselves as truly “catholic,” in one sense of the original Latin word. Catholicus means “universal,” and the early Reformers tried to reform Christian worship and church practices according to what Christians had “universally” believed and practiced.
The Reformation began roughly 500 years ago. What many don’t realize, however, is that a similar reformation is occurring today, only not in the churches, but in the schools. Classical Christian schools, to be more specific.
Like the original Reformers, educators in the classical Christian school movement seek to train and equip the next generation of leaders who will boldly stand for the truth in their culture, churches, and homes. They seek to inspire students who will bravely challenge the status quo, motivated by what they see in Scripture. And they hope that students’ brief exposure to the Great Books, the Great Thinkers, and the classical languages like Latin and Greek will enable them to gain the wisdom and eloquence to lead a new Reformation.
Is it possible that by teaching students to stand on the shoulders of these intellectual giants, they, like the Reformers before them, will be able to steer the world down a completely different path than the one it is currently on?

North and South Korea agree to reunions of families divided by war
Reunions of about 200 people come after dramatic improvement in countries’ relations
Fri, Jun 22, 2018, 18:11

Delegations from North and South Korea agreed on Friday to arrange the first reunions in three years of some of the families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.
The reunions – scheduled for August 20th-26th – are an emotive issue, especially for the elderly relatives taking part in tearful meetings after decades of separation – and have taken place from time to time during periods of good ties between the two Koreas.
The Red Cross organisations from the two countries will arrange the reunions which will involve about 200 selected people from the two sides, they said in a joint statement after a meeting of delegations.
The reunions are among steps promised by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in as part of a dramatic improvement in relations between them this year, after fears of war over North Korean nuclear and missile programmes last year.
“The whole world is marvelling at the amazing developments between the North and South,” said Pak Yong Il, the leader of the North Korean delegation at the talks that took place at a hotel in North Korea’s tourist destination of Mount Kumgang.
Human rights issue
Tensions on the Korean peninsula eased significantly after a summit last week between Mr Kim and US president Donald Trump, in which they agreed that they would work towards the denuclearisation of the peninsula.
The reunions will be held at Mount Kumgang, the two sides said, with 100 people from each side to be chosen to meet long-lost relatives from the other side.
South Korean officials have often called for the visits to resume as a “humanitarian and human rights issue”, especially since many individuals are now in their 80s and 90s.
The first reunions were held in 1985. About 20 have been held since then with the last in 2015.
Since 2000, about 23,676 separated Koreans, from both North and South, have met or interacted through videolink as part of the programme, the Hyundai Research Institute think tank said.
But time is running out.
By March, 56 per cent of the 131,531 South Koreans who applied to take part in reunions had died, it said.
It was not clear if North Korea had dropped a condition it had previously set for resuming the reunions – that South Korea return 12 North Korean women who worked at a North Korea-run restaurant in China and defected to the South in 2016.
Peace treaty
Several of the women said in May they were coerced into leaving, while South Korean officials said they were trying to verify their accounts.
As recently as May the North Korean Red Cross organisation urged South Korea to return the women “without delay”.
The 1950-53 Korean War was concluded only with a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the combatants technically still at war, with the so-called demilitarised zone between them one of the cold war’s most heavily fortified borders.
Pak, the deputy head of the North’s agency to promote reunification, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, called for the past to be set aside.
“We should also part with the past and go down the road our leaders have forged for us,” he said. – Reuters

Interview by
Erin Schell
Richard Florida burst into the mainstream with 2002’s The Rise of the Creative Class . Over the past decade, his ideas about what drives economic growth have spawned new policy prescriptions in American cities. Florida’s most controversial claim is that the urban “creative class” — which he says comprises 35 percent of the US labor force — is at the root of new economic growth.
For Florida, the “economic revolution” of the new creative economy is occurring in tandem with an “urban revolution.” Major metropolitan areas, he maintains, have become the de facto form of social organization in the post-industrial era; they are the place where the creative class lives, works, and most importantly, clusters together.
The essence of Florida’s idea is simple: creative class prosperity, located within the economic and social structures unique to the urban environment, attracts new waves of creative class immigration, in turn expanding urban colonies of prosperity. Thus, cities provide the scaffolding not only for the day-to-day life and happiness of the creative class; they are the engines of prosperity itself.
One can see the appeal of such an idea to urban policy makers as well as to the fortunate members of the creative class: they are the designated knights of a promising future, and they bear the bittersweet responsibility to better the world for us all.
Florida’s “Three T’s” — technology, talent, and tolerance — serve as the analytical factors that determine his “creativity index” of economic development in cities. It follows that progressive policy decisions aimed at nurturing an open-minded urban ecology of arts and culture that appeal to the tastes of the creative class — charming Wi-Fi equipped cafés, vintage boutiques, cozy galleries, and music venues — are seen not only as an effect of economic prosperity, as a cause of it.
At least from the publication of The Rise of the Creative Class in 2002 until the 2008 crisis, it seemed to follow that any downtrodden city possessed the potential to stem depopulation and instead attract the creative class with the right combination of infrastructure and cultural investments. The well-paying jobs would follow on the heels of their arrival.
Of course, the flipside to a successful city in the creative age is the displacement of the non-creative class and widening inequality in our cities, a problem that Florida freely admits. The popularity of his urban prescriptions have drawn ire from both the Left and Right, the former regarding him as a “neoliberal dressed in black”; the latter accusing him of neglecting family values through his trumpeting of hip gays and minorities as integral to urban economic growth.
No doubt Richard Florida is filled with good intentions. Yet the broadly progressive truism that he claims motivates his work — creativity, a universally innate human trait, deserves the chance to be realized — is challenged by his acceptance of neoliberal capitalism and market logic as the inevitable economic situation that the creative class is obliged to shape from within.
The shortcomings of such an understanding are glaring. We’re left to wonder how redistributive concessions could ever be won from above, without an account of non-creative class political agitation from below.
What follows is a condensed and edited transcript of my conversation with Florida, where he generously gave me the opportunity to ask him to elaborate on some of the political implications of his work.
ES
You have said previously that “we’re living right now through the greatest economic transformation in human history.” What changes in the state are accompanying this economic transformation?
RF
I’ve been interested in the big structural shifts in capitalism since I was an undergraduate at Rutgers, and I came at that pretty much from a Marxist or neo-Marxian point of view.
I read all of Marx, I read all of Schumpeter, I took classes in Hegel and Marx, and the Frankfurt School, and what I came to understand is that the biggest problem we confront intellectually is how capitalism changes. And that happens in these big disruptive bursts. The classic ones would be the rise of modern industry in the nineteenth century, and then in US terms, the great crises of, say, the 1870s or the 1890s and the Great Depression of the 1930s.
I began to believe, and many people began to believe, with Keynesian demand management and smart economic policy, that this wouldn’t happen again. Lo and behold, in 2008, we had a crash on the same order of magnitude of those…
What I’ve been really interested in is understanding why capitalism does not collapse, and why capitalism is able to remake itself. Early on, then, I got very interested in Joseph Schumpeter and his theory of how capitalism revolutionizes itself, mainly through creative destruction, powered by these great entrepreneurs.
There’s a great economist of innovation called Christopher Freeman. I met Chris Freeman as a young scholar, and what Freeman said to me, which was really interesting, I asked him, “How did you come to Joseph Schumpeter?” And he said, “Well I was basically a Marxist, but when I wrote stuff about Marx, nobody would publish my articles. When I substituted the name ‘Schumpeter’ for ‘Marx,’ my papers would get published everywhere.”
What I thought Schumpeter did was very interestingly point to the fact that capitalism doesn’t collapse necessarily in the way Marx predicted, but it’s able to self-revolutionize because it can generate new technologies, new industries.
What I tried to do, successfully or unsuccessfully, is to marry this notion of what Marx and Schumpeter were talking about with modern urban studies. And what I think I came to figure out — whether you guys like it or not — is that the industrial corporation and the factory were the arena for Marxian innovation, the Schumpeter innovation, and Marxian class conflict in the older phase of capitalism.
In this new stage of capitalism — call it the knowledge economy, the postindustrial economy, whatever — place itself has become the key social and economic organizing unit: where the knowledge workers congregate, where the infrastructure of capitalism is built (like roads, density, communications, etc). And this packing in of people, à la Jane Jacobs and Robert Lucas, it is place itself that supplants, becomes the social and economic organizing unit of modern capitalism, analogous to the factory.
What I’ve tried to do is show how place plays that role in both the growth of capitalism, the dynamism of capitalism, and its instability. And there, I tried to marry the insights of Jane Jacobs and, a little bit, the insights of David Harvey. So I see this crisis not so much a crisis that’s expressed in the economy, but a crisis that is expressed in this contestation over place.
When I wrote The Rise of the Creative Class , all I could focus on was the dynamics of place in leading this Schumpeterian reinvention of capitalism. I could not have predicted that this same reinvention of capitalism would lead to a similar, analogous kind of crisis that we saw in 2008. Right now, I think we’re seeing an expression of that crisis, of capitalism trying to remake itself around dynamic cities and urban areas.
ES
I was hoping you could discuss some of the political implications of your concept “quality of place,” as a more specified measure of a city’s economic potential than “quality of life.” What I have in mind here is — we’re speaking to you from New York City, where famously, Rudy Giuliani and Bill Bratton, our once-again police commissioner implemented “broken windows laws” that crackdown on petty crime like loitering and graffiti.
Giuliani essentially made homelessness illegal, and Michael Bloomberg just in 2009 was giving one-way tickets to homeless people to leave the city, which could be seen asa kind of spatial solution, I suppose. So I’m just wondering how you would respond —
RF
Disgusting. I mean, one word: disgusting. I was a huge opponent of people like Rudy Giuliani. I have much more respect for Mike Bloomberg, and I actually quite like the current mayor, and am a big fan of the comptroller, Scott Stringer. If you saw, Scott and I just did an event on building a more inclusive and creative New York. So I am extremely aware of the issues of inclusivity, as well as diversity and quality of place, and I would say I’ve become one of the leading champions of this.
What I’ve decided to do, to be quite honest, is instead of raising many of these issues in an oppositional way, to try to phrase them within the logic of capitalist economic development. Some might call me a neoliberal. I don’t like that label. But all I tried to do was phrase issues that would broaden the debate about urbanism in ways that mayors and economic developers could accept — rather than trying to combat them in a directly oppositional way, which I think, by the way, is useful.
I thought I could use my influence in a different way. There was a debate between Rosa Luxemburg, and Trostky and Lenin, and Karl Kautsky. I saw myself following a more Kautskyite position — reform within the system.
When I talk about quality of place, I talk about quality of place for everyone. My critics can shape and twist this. But I’m talking about parks for everyone, green space for everyone, cities for everyone, cities that are diverse and open without regard to race and ethnicity, and how those things actually, ironically, propel development.
The open-minded, the tolerant, the diverse city, where people have access, becomes a better city that people feel more connected to, and are more productive. Because many of the innovations that drive capitalism don’t come from — and this is what the whole idea of the creative class is about — classifying people by education level and college degrees, but by the kind of work they do.
This is directly derived from Marx: what are the kinds of occupations that define the classes? Much of creativity doesn’t come from the high-minded software engineer, or biotechnician, but it comes from the street, and this is a defining characteristic of American urban areas.
I think I’ve been very unfairly criticized for not dealing with socioeconomic inequality. I think I’ve been one of the first urbanists, modern urbanists, empirical urbanists, to point to socioeconomic inequality. I said it was a direct outgrowth of the clustering of knowledge and creative workers, and their competition. In Rise of the Creative Class , I said that place would become the arena for class conflict in modern capitalism, and I think I didn’t quite know how that would play out. I cautioned city leaders and the creative class to be well aware over that contestation over space.
ES
You seem to designate the creative class as the universal class — by which I mean the primary agent of social transformation and social change — i.e. the revolutionary class. Yet at the same time there appears to be a rejection of class struggle in your analysis.
I’ve heard you say previously, and I’m paraphrasing, that it’s not about division, it’s about the working class, the service class, and the creative class all coming and working together as a team, in cities. Given the structural limitations capitalism puts upon the non-creative classes, how do you envision the service and working classes —
RF
There’s a difference between the one percent and the creative class. Going back to Marx, if you really want to think about how I formulated this, I went back to the Grundrisse . Already in the Grundrisse Marx is pointing to the rise of social and collective knowledge. Remember, he looked at the factory as a collectivity, as a place of intersubjective production.
What I began to believe was that as factory production declines to what we have now — 5 or 6 percent of Americans involved in direct factory production, getting to what agriculture was in the thirties or forties — that there was another kind of intersubjective production that binds people together, and it’s human creativity.
I think, empirically, I had to make a call. And the empirical call was I had to document people who were paid in some way to use their creativity and dub them a socio­economic class, in contrast to the lower-income service class, who are not paid. They should be paid to use their creativity; we have to extend the boundaries of that class. I believe that every human being is creative.
I’d say the central contradiction of capitalism — I say this in The Rise of the Creative Class , completely overlooked — is the attempt to impose top-down order, corporate direction, corporate control over the full flourishing of human creativity — this conflict between organization and creativity.
If Marx saw the working class as the universal class, I think the creative class — the notion that every human being is creative — is an even broader class.
ES
I think what you just spoke to, about this contradiction — the mistake of trying to institutionalize an ordering from above, rather than harnessing creativity from below — points back to my first question that I’m hoping to push you on regarding the political implications of your work.
I’ve heard you say previously that we should really have mayors leading the way in steering economic growth, with the help of the federal government subordinated to their leadership. But my fear is that instead of serving the function of redistribution, the role of the state then becomes one of surveillance and securitization; to serve and protect the boundaries of the creative class, legitimized through the rhetoric of universal creativity —
RF
Let me give you a simple answer, and then you can push me more. I’ve come to have a very different reaction to a lot of my friends about cities being able to do it all. I don’t think cities and mayors can do it all. I think they have limited powers, and I think that we need a really progressive urban policy around this.
The contours of that progressive urban policy are hard to specify, and in my next book I’m going to work on it more. Clearly it has be concerned with inequality, it has to be concerned with segregation. We have to be concerned with concentrated poverty, which increasingly looks to me like a problem that is even more devastating than gentrification.
This is where I say the urban optimists and the urban pessimists, we have to come together. We can’t stay in this oppositional position. We have got to come together and figure out a new route for federal policy. Will it be perfectly progressive policy? No. But I think we have to come together on this, and I do think it means taking care of the people being left behind.
As you know, the biggest element of my work recently has been trying to look at what is happening with the group I call the service class that no one wants to focus on. People want to talk about knowledge workers, education, manufacturing, the industrial working class, but nearly half of us toil in these low-wage, contingent, minimum-wage, low-skilled, routine service jobs.
And I’ve written a lot about the need for global minimum wages that are tagged for the cost of living, and I’ve written a lot about the need for an effective strategy to upgrade those jobs. So yeah, I think that state policy now, you’re right — and I think it’s not just the security state, it’s this modern, quote unquote … “smart city of censors,” and total 24 by 7 security. I mean, this is something that would make Orwell shutter. So yeah, we need to do something, but in the absence of some kind of unified, urban progressive —
It’s interesting to me, I feel like I’m part of the leadership of that kind of movement, and in some ways I feel excluded from it. I feel like people are putting me with the conservatives. I call it the narcissism of small differences. We need to come together.
In my next book, it’s something I’m looking at in a very clear-eyed, open-minded, and hopefully hard-nosed fashion.
ES
You were talking about your interest in the transformation of capital­ism, and how capitalism keeps managing to transform itself. Would you dare to make the argument, then, that it’s possible to transform beyond the cyclical crises of capitalism? I’d also like to raise here the Marxian concept of the “reserve army of labor” —
RF
We have a large reserve army of labor in global capitalism, and a pattern of uneven development that Americans and American urbanists have to wake up to. I look at the greatest challenge, it’s global urbanization, where we’re going to put billions of people in cities, and many of them still live in global slums. The whole kind of automatic relationships between agglomeration and urbanism and development is not occurring. It’s not fine to me. So no, I think capitalism is fundamentally destabilizing.
The Kautskyite in me — here’s what worries me: I cannot imagine the hell that will occur if this system really breaks down. I think of my dad during the Depression, working in a factory, fighting in World War II, the hell that was his life. God I would hate to see that kind of system breakdown today, with nuclear arsenals. So I will do everything in my power to try to ensure that we avoid system breakdown…
But I really think it means building great cities. I think this is what progressives and conservatives don’t get. If we don’t build these great containers of place, that work and that have great infrastructure — social, knowledge, physical — that bind us together and create pathways to opportunity for all, this thing is really unstable.
But frankly, it’s hard to see the alternative out there. I’m fifty-seven. I would opt for a better, more egalitarian, more progressive form of capitalism than an unknown. You guys may not like me for that, but I would think — a unionized capitalism, with a stable working class, getting my dad the ability to own a home was better than the capitalism that came before it, and I think we can do a lot better today.
ES
I think we’re all in agreement on hoping for a more egalitarian future, but I think the thing that concerns me a little bit is, again, the lack of political struggle in your account, the lack of any opposition that’s typically thought of when you think of politics —
RF
Of course, because the creative class is an atomized class. And it’s this possessive individualism that all of us suffer for. And all of us have to wake up. So I don’t think it’s the working class and the service class versus the creative class. It’s every one of us outside the owners of the means of production. That’s why I wanted to specify this group of knowledge workers that potentially is a revolutionary class.
I believe Marx would’ve seen these knowledge workers not as the petit bourgeois, but as a group of people whose objective conditions force them to understand the intersubjective nature of their labor, their dependence upon one another, those who can’t afford it, and those service workers who support them and create the infrastructure — you know, home cleaning, healthcare, personal care, food preparation.
All of us are in this together, and if we draw lines — working class, creative class, service class — we’re cuffed. But I do think the creative class owes it to society, because of its privileged position, because of its level of education, to see this.
We lack a progressive left. We have an animated, completely purposeful right that terrifies me. But we on the left shoot at one another. We need a progressive and purposeful left that can provide a vision of a better life for everyone.
Now what scares me, of course, is for every Bill de Blasio, we have a Rob Ford. And what really terrifies me, if you ask me what really shook me to my bones, was the rise of Rob Ford in Toronto. If you had asked me a decade ago if one of the most progressive cities in the world could elect a retro­grade thug, I would have said you were insane. To see Rob Ford’s rise in Toronto, to see the group of new immigrants, working-class people, new Canadians who supported him … the “what’s the matter with Toronto?” It terrifies me. So I think this galvanized me more.
ES
Based on what you just said, it sort of sounds like you’re framing class struggle, perhaps, around the Occupy credo of 99% versus 1%. But is that sort of like —
RF
It’s the means of production, and it’s not the creative class versus the working class, you know. It’s those who own and control. That’s what Marx would’ve said: it’s the ownership.
ES
But isn’t that an oversimplification? So, it sounds great, but if one of the central tenets of capitalism is competition —
RF
Of course, the trade workers versus the mass industrial workers, pitting worker against worker, pitting people against people. It’s a central tenet of capitalism. And that’s what a progressive movement should help to overcome.
But I don’t think we should say it’s the creative class versus the working class. I think that’s the wrong way to frame it. If we exclude the 35 percent of us who are knowledge workers, and the 50 percent of us in cities like San Francisco, and we make the big struggle a Google worker against a service worker — it’s really who owns and controls the means of production.
It’s not individual capitalists; it’s a structure. It’s a structure of capitalism at the very top. Finance capital is really hamstringing us.

Change in Medicare’s “substantial improvement” standard
Posted by Daniel J. Eccher Esq. | Jun 12, 2013 | 0 Comments
Aging is never easy and many people experience a short hospitalization followed by a longer stay in a skilled nursing facility. Elderly people in Maine and elsewhere have generally understood that their hospitalization will be covered by Medicare and that Medicare can cover skilled nursing care for up to 100 days. After 100 days, continued care is considered “long-term” or “custodial” care which Medicare does not pay for.
Up until the fall of 2012, Medicare had a practice of only paying for a skilled nursing facility so long as the patient continued to make “significant improvement”. If the patient was no longer making significant improvement, Medicare's practice was to stop paying, even if this was well before the 100-day allowance. Last fall, this practice of terminating coverage based on the “substantial improvement” standard ended. Now, the new standard for continued Medicare coverage is whether the patient needs skilled care — even if it would simply maintain the patient's current condition or slow further deterioration. The stated standard is “The skilled services must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of your condition.” The care must also be ordered by a physician. This is a big and positive change to a long-standing practice. Medicare is now covering some patients that it was not covering just six months ago.
If you or a loved one is denied Medicare coverage for skilled nursing care in Maine, it may be helpful to meet with us. We are Maine elder law attorneys (referred to sometimes as “elder lawyers” or “elder care attorneys”). We would review the situation to determine whether you are entitled to continue coverage and then help you resolve this with Medicare.

In Mueller’s Wake, Who are Putin’s Real Useful Idiots?

Since opening its web portal doors more than 20 years ago, the company’s motto had always been “don’t be evil.” This changed in early 2018 when the search engine juggernaut quietly removed the phrase from its code of conduct – its parent company, Alphabet, maintains the variant of “do the right thing.” It was meant to be a guiding principle for the company’s future decisions, but it appears to have been more of an impediment to padding the bottom line and employing questionable business practices, hence its deletion.
Over the years, the Silicon Valley behemoth has been accused of quashing dissent, demanding groupthink, censoring the right, and so much more. Now, if the latest allegations are true, the company has also been covering up sexual misconduct among high-level senior employees.
Perhaps its slogan moving forward should be: “Don’t be evil – maybe.”
A $90 Million Cover Up
A new lawsuit submitted by stockholder James Martin alleges that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, as well as the board of directors, maintained a “multi-year scheme to cover up sexual harassment and discrimination at Alphabet.” The case lists a $90 million severance payout to a senior executive, following an internal investigation into a credible claim.
Court documents list Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile operating system, as a defendant. The company discovered an accusation that Rubin forced a Google employee into performing oral sex on him was accurate. As a result, he was given a $90 million check and “a hero’s farewell.” Former senior executive Amit Singhal is also named in the lawsuit. Singhal left in 2015 when he received a multi-million-dollar payout after other misconduct allegations were found credible.
The shareholder asserts that Google’s board violated its responsibilities “by such despicable conduct” and wasted resources by “disregarding, covering up and rewarding malfeasance of its senior executives.” The lawsuit requests court orders demanding financial restitution to the company from Rubin, Singhal, and board members. It also asks for changes in Google’s procedures.
Martin’s case passes the blame onto the company’s co-founders and Eric Schmidt, a former CEO and current board member. The suit notes that these men “set the tone” for a corporate culture of misconduct by having relationships and extramarital affairs with Google employees.
In the aftermath of the news, workers united in showing their displeasure with the company. Recently, more than 20,000 employees staged a walkout at corporate offices worldwide. Too bad James Damore never garnered the same level of support after questioning Google’s hiring practices.
Alphabet and Google have not issued a public statement regarding the matter.
Taxpayers Footing the Bill
While the inner struggles of Google are inducing popcorn-level entertainment, it is important to remember that taxpayers are footing the bill for some of its excess. In fact, because Silicon Valley tech goliaths maintain intimate relationships with all three levels of government and those on Capitol Hill, your precious tax dollars are entering the pockets of Google, Amazon, Facebook, and others.
There have been constant reports about these billion-dollar corporations receiving government contracts, especially with the military and intelligence branches.
So, the next time you read a story about a pervert getting a big payday because Google or Facebook didn’t want the incident to go public, remember that you’ve been forced to contribute monetarily to the scandal.
Morally Vacuous
How come the most woke seem to be the creepiest? Better yet, why are the most ardent opponents of President Donald Trump the biggest hypocrites? The biblical passages of “cast the first stone” and “judge not lest ye be judged” enter the conversation when discussing these executives’ virtues and views.
Silicon Valley disciples are a judgmental, self-righteous, and holier-than-thou bunch. They turn their noses at middle America, they furrow their brows at conservatives, and they hate President Trump. This was on full display in a leaked 2016 video showing Google executives lamenting Trump’s victory, further straining the relations between Republicans and the technology gatekeepers.
The video, released in September, was recorded during one of the company’s weekly all-hands meetings. It includes a clip of Brin admitting that he found the election results “deeply offensive”:
“Let’s face it, most people here are pretty upset and pretty sad because of the election. Myself, as an immigrant and refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive and I know many of you do too.”
While any observer can deduce that this is evidence of a leftist bias impacting the company’s operations, a spokesperson for Google denied such an assertion, noting that the meeting was an event for employees to “express their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season.” The cherry on top in the media statement was the claim that “our products are built for everyone.”
Virtue-signaling in Silicon Valley is just as bad in Tinseltown. Thespians, filmmakers, musicians, and Hollywood moguls view themselves as the nation’s conscience and moral superiors. Yet, the barrage of reports shining a negative light on the overall industry suggests these actors and singers would be better off uttering the words written for them rather than trying to formulate their own thoughts.
Schadenfreude isn’t a positive emotion. That said, when you keep finding out the innumerable transgressions in Washington, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and other regions inhabited by society’s elite, you cannot help feel some pleasure from their misfortunes. For too long, they have treated anyone who doesn’t think like them with contempt. They have finally gotten a taste of their own medicine.

And yet, if any one of their direct victims were to seek street justice against one of these ‘untouchable elites’, that victim would be pilloried in the news AND in court. Maybe decent folks should give them the treatment Mad Maxine Waters is so fond of – make a fuss every time they are seen in public until they have to live in hiding.

Say What is the segment of Liberty Nation Radio where we unveil some of the most wacky, astonishing and damnable things uttered by politicians and the chattering class. Here is the latest episode:
Tim Donner: In a busy week in the world of politics – there’s something new – we saw another one of those obscure district court judges rule that President Trump cannot stop people from entering the country when they’re breaking the law. Trump ruffled feathers by essentially exonerating Saudi Arabia in the gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi for the sake of the American economy, and the stock market took a nose-dive. We’ll get to all of that, but we’ll start with the non-concession concession by defeated Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who leveled serious charges of racist voter suppression against her victorious opponent, Brian Kemp.
Stacey Abrams
Stacey Abrams: Citizens tried to exercise their constitutional rights and were still denied the ability to elect their leaders. Under the watch of the now former secretary of state, democracy failed Georgia. I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election. But to watch an elected official who claims to represent the people in the state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote has been truly appalling. So let’s be clear, this is not a speech of concession.
Tim: And so, confidence in the electoral process and on the fairness of voting will take another hit. Amid polls showing that the constant accusations of Russian meddling in 2016 put forward by the Democrats, and, of course, the appointment of a special counsel to investigate it, some 40% of voters believe Russia tampered with the votes in 2016. And again, some 40% do not have confidence their votes will be counted fairly.
But that story was quickly overshadowed by another one of those obscure district court judges looking for his 15 minutes of fame. Judge Jon S. Tigar, no relation to the character in Winnie the Pooh, I presume, from (where else?) San Francisco, issued a nationwide restraining order barring enforcement of the policy President Trump announced on Nov. 8, limiting asylum seekers to legal checkpoints. So what is customs and border enforcement supposed to do now when the caravan arrives? CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said on Fox News that this heavily male caravan represents a genuine threat.
Kevin McAleenan
Kevin McAleenan: This is a different kind of caravan. This is a very large group. It’s cohesive. It’s primarily adult males. We’ve seen them cross two international borders, by force, already. They’ve assaulted law enforcement professionals, both in Guatemala and Mexico. We’ve seen them be willing to use very aggressive tactics, and so we’ve got to be prepared for that. The worst case contingency would be thousands of people trying to force their way through vehicle lanes at a port of entry, unlawfully, into the U.S. And that’s what we’re prepared to stop.
Tim: Already, the folks in the Mexican border town of Tijuana have made clear that the caravaners are not welcome there. But just as that story got heated up, Trump raised a ruckus by saying, despite plentiful evidence and reason to believe that the Saudi royal family was involved in, or even masterminded, the murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the president is not making any sudden moves against them.
President Trump: It’s America first to me; it’s all about America first. We’re not going to give up hundreds of billions of dollars in orders and let Russia, China, and everybody else have them. Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof. I’ve kept them down. They’re buying hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of things from this country. If I say, we don’t want to take your business, if I say, we’re going to cut it off, they will get the equipment, military equipment, and other things, from Russia and China. I’m not going to destroy the world economy, and I’m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia.
Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is, and always has been, about money…
Tim: So Trump, once again, is saying what every other politician thought but never stated. And he’s getting hammered for it by high-minded politicians in both parties who say we have to stand up for American principles. As if our relationship with Saudi Arabia is based on any kind of principle to begin with. We get cheap oil from them, and they’re a relatively stable pro-American regime in a region full of corrupt authoritarian regimes, including theirs. Our relationship with Saudi Arabia is, and always has been, about money, plain and simple. And it exists, not because of but in spite of the ruling House of Saud.
Now, just as the Trump Saudi Arabia story was breaking, the stock market tanked, dropping almost a thousand points early in the week, largely due to a plunge in tech stocks. The new term is the FAANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. But Trump’s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said to hold the panic.
Larry Kudlow: The economy, the basic economy, has reawakened, and it’s going to stay there. I’m reading some of the weirdest stuff, how recession is around the corner. Nonsense. My personal view, our administration’s view, recession is so far in the distance I can’t see it.
Tim: We can only hope.
Kirsten Powers
We close with another statement demonstrating how the left has moved on from condemning Trump to condemning the 62 million people who voted for him. The latest on CNN from once respectable liberal Kirsten Powers aimed at white women:
Kirsten Powers: They’ll say, well, I’m not racist. I just voted for him because I didn’t like Hillary Clinton. And I just want to say that that’s not … that doesn’t make you not racist, it actually makes you racist.
Tim: So the, what, 25 million or so white women who voted for Trump are not just deplorable and irredeemable but outright racist? That word used to mean something, but it has now been used so often by the left as to be rendered meaningless. And it says little about Trump and everything about leftists who continue to treat Trump as if he is an illegitimate president, tearing the world apart, when in actuality he’s tearing their world apart.

Nice work, Jim.
We’ve been given a very skewed version of history.
Taking a step back through time; when FDR visited the Nuremberg trials, he witness how violently Russia tortured Nazi prisoners into confessing to things they hadn’t done. The horror of how the communists treated the prisoners is what caused FDR to start the search for communists in the US. After he returned, McCarthyism began and the hunt for communists was on. While I’m not a holocaust denier, history has proven that even Hitler feared communism. Also, during the Great Depression, many US citizens traveled to Stalin’s Russia to find work. Some who wished to return to the US were allowed back, but later, others were denied because it was feared they would have communist influence. There is no record of how many of those who weren’t allowed to return had survived Stalin’s purges.
So, here, in our country, does that mean we should let socialism appear to be something other than communism? If we let socialism get a hold on our government, we will experience the downfall of the US. Today, maybe revamping McCarthyism would scare the left into sanity.

Demoralize much, Ms. Powers? In the editorial notes of the Manual on Psychopolitics, Kenneth Goff, who claimed to be a member of the Communist Party, claims that they were taught that demoralization and degradation has become the preferred method of conquering a nation. Control of the population can be obtained without the destruction of war. America’s education system has long been dominated by the Left and has been used as an instrument of thought control over the American population. Today, we see an entire generation of Americans advocating for Socialism, believing there are more than two genders, and believing that any belief system that goes against theirs is hate speech. They are beaten down with self-hatred and taught that their country represents oppression and racism. They have been psychologically conditioned to believe that killing their unborn children is somehow an esteemed human right that takes precedence above all others. If these concepts don’t represent a process of demoralization, then nothing does.

As the powers that be in Washington are locked in a bitter dispute over border security, everyday Americans are still reaping the toxic consequences of a flawed immigration system. For these individuals, illegal immigration is more than a political football or a novel way to signal one’s virtue; it is the difference between promoting the American dream and taking unnecessary risks out of a misguided sense of compassion.
Recently, several news stories have been published discussing victims of violent crimes committed by individuals residing in the United States illegally. The most recent, which involved the brutal murder of a police officer who happened to be a legal immigrant, illustrates an important difference between the conservative and leftist approaches to this highly contentious issue.
Officer Ronil Singh
Who Was Officer Singh?
Officer Ronil Singh, 33, came to the United States about 20 years ago. He had always dreamed of becoming a police officer, and later served as a volunteer at the Modesto Police Department. Later, he worked with the Newman Police Department, where he eventually reached the rank of corporal.
While most of the stories about legal immigrants focus on those who come to America to become wealthy, the majority simply want a better life, regardless of wealth. They are people like Officer Singh, who just wanted to serve and protect his community. Unfortunately, his life was cut short by a criminal alien who shot him in cold blood during a traffic stop.
Gustavo Perez Arriaga
Singh’s Murderer
In contrast, the man who allegedly murdered Officer Singh is clearly not the type of individual America needs. Gustavo Perez Arriaga, a 32-year-old gang member with multiple prior arrests for offenses – including driving under the influence. It was suspicion of drunk driving that prompted Officer Singh to pull him over.
But one of the most striking differences between Singh and Arriaga is the fact that the latter entered the United States illegally. He was one of many who slipped through the system due to our faulty policies. While the left is constantly attempting to convince the American public that the people who subvert our immigration laws are completely harmless, stories such as this put the lie to their claims.
What the Open Borders Lobby Has Wrought
Officer Singh’s murder is a story that comes at an inconvenient time for the progressive left, which has a vested interest in downplaying the potential dangers posed by some of the individuals who cross our borders illegally. But it also highlights a sharp difference between ordinary Americans on the left and the right.
…willing to accept a more lenient approach to immigration despite the potential risks.
Left-leaning individuals see that people in other countries are often suffering from brutal governments, rampant poverty, and gang violence. While their leaders have more cynical reasons for encouraging illegal immigration, most of the rank and file tend to have a genuine concern for those who are less fortunate.
For this reason, they are willing to accept a more lenient approach to immigration despite the potential risks. The fact that their influencers in the establishment media routinely assure them that none of these people are threats only assuages their consciences further.
On the other hand, most right-leaning Americans want immigrants to come to the United States. Contrary to what the left would have you believe, conservatives also care about those who leave the poor conditions experienced in their home countries.
It is one of the reasons why they hold such reverence for Cubans who fled from Fidel Castro’s brutal communist regime to seek asylum in America. It is why they respect people who are willing to go through the process to become citizens.
But more than that, conservatives understand the seriousness of ensuring the safety of those already residing legally in the country. They know that the majority of those who initially break the law to enter the country do not go on to other crimes, but they also recognize that the atrocities committed by the individuals who are violent could have been prevented by enforcing robust immigration policies.
Progressive Policies Are Dangerous
The reality is that the progressive approach, while seeming to be compassionate, is threatening to both Americans and many of those who are entering the country illegally. Like many other leftist programs, it dons the facade of empathy, but in reality, exacts a tremendous toll on a significant number of people.
Unfortunately, Singh’s story is only one example of how failed immigration policies endanger citizens. Sanctuary cities, which are often promoted by progressives, are also putting American lives in danger. A recent study demonstrated that crime decreased in Phoenix, Arizona after its leadership abandoned its sanctuary city laws. Former police officer Levi Bolton told Fox news that the city “saw a 20-year low crime rate” after they allowed local law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities.
There are very few people in the United States of America that could be classified as anti-immigration. Indeed, the public wants immigrants to build new lives in America, but they want to ensure that the nation allows only the right people to settle in the country, not those who will make American society worse. Put simply, We want the type of immigration policies that every other developed nation uses without placing law-abiding individuals in jeopardy.

I wonder if the left actually despises legal immigrants. These people WANT to become Americans. They study and understand our constitution and why our country is so much better than places they have left. I would tend to believe most of these people are also conservative minded as they know very well what the left has done to their own countries. The left would prefer the illegals. They have studied nothing and will be easily indoctrinated.

Nasty Pelosi, Chuck. U. Schumer and the rest of the slimy DemocRATs care more about protecting illegal alien invaders than they do our own law enforcement and U.S. citizens. The blood of every citizen that has been and will be murdered by one of these illegal alien invader is on their hands.

Officer Singh was an honorable man and a legal citizen of America. He is the kind of immigrant we need in America, hardworking, honest and honorable. Having people like Singh as a fellow American raises the bar for all of us. Dogpile Arriaga and all of his Criminal Immigrant ilk are what the Traitor Dems ARE using to destroy America. I would gladly trade every traitor Democrat one for one for the Singh’s of this world. We would immediately become a vastly improved nation. But the Dems want the Dogpile Arriaga and with the Arriaga’s we will become immediately a trashpit country similar to the countries the Arriaga’s come from.

Simply put: Singh is an American, Arriaga is not, never was, and did not want to be. We let a violent nonconformist slip into our country and we were repaid with the loss of a good man, kind human being, and the kind of American we need more of.

OPEN PAYMENT REPORT DETAILS FEES PAID TO MEDICAID DOCTORS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
A recent study has revealed that during the last five months of 2013, Connecticut doctors received over $6 million in funds from pharmaceutical companies. Coming from the Open Payment program, the release is presented by the federal agency the Centers for Medicare & Medical Services, and presents information about the apparently interconnected financial relationships amongst U.S. doctors and the healthcare industry. The data comes from a federal database search authorized under a provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This lengthy report outlines how $3.5 billion was received by U.S doctors throughout the country as payment compensation for travel fees, consulting/presentations, and other services provided to the healthcare industry between the period of August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013. Over 5,000 Connecticut doctors were able to take advantage of these funds.
The Centers for Medicare & Medical Services
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is a federal agency that is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency provides a broad assortment of services aimed at coordinating and observing Medicaid and Medicare programs nationwide. As part of its observation, the agency utilized a provision of the ACA that was aimed at providing consumers with a snapshot of the financial interactions between their physicians and the healthcare industry. The result was Open Payment, a national disclosure program, which recently released data that outlines the various forms that these financial relationships can take, including payments received for speaking fees, consultation fees, gifts, research and development fundings, travel, and meals. The data comes from mandatory reports that healthcare manufacturers and purchasing organizations were required to submit upon the transfers of value and ownership/investment interests to physicians.
One physician from Connecticut made the top 10 list for the amount of funds received from the healthcare industry. The physician is a doctor at UConn, and an associate professor of orthopedic surgery. This doctor received almost $165,000 from Arthrex, an orthopedic medical device company. The Open Payment release reveals that doctors in Connecticut, some of whom are also paid through Medicare and Medicaid funds, are receiving large amounts from the healthcare industry. For example, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is one of the main pharmaceutical companies that makes payments to Connecticut doctors. During the five-month period that is the subject of the new release, Boehringer made $261,000 in payments to Connecticut doctors.
In total, the data illustrates that Connecticut doctors were paid over $1 million in order to discuss certain drugs and to give presentations. This practice, known as “speaker’s bureaus,” is the process of medical device and drug companies seeking out credible doctors to provide training sessions and other services for their new models. Doctors perform training sessions and presentations and otherwise endorse the drugs or medical devices in exchange for travel expenses to and from presentation destinations, and also in the form of grants of research funding and/or consulting fee payments.

Cholera Epidemic in Haiti Demands Immediate Action Say U.S. Senators Markey and Rubio
Friday, July 22, 2016
Senators call on United Nations to accept responsibility and take steps to respond to public health emergency
Washington (July 22, 2016) – As Haiti continues to suffer from a cholera epidemic that has resulted in more cases and deaths than any other known cholera outbreak in the Americas, Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called on the State Department to address the crisis and urge the United Nations (UN) to take responsibility and appropriate steps to remedy the public health emergency. An independent report found that faulty sanitation from the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti introduced the cholera bacteria, which has since led to more than 731,000 suspected cholera cases and nearly 9,000 deaths since 2010.
“The United States should utilize its leadership position to stress the importance of UN accountability and action to remediate the ongoing impact of cholera in Haiti,” write the Senators in the letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. “We respectfully urge the State Department to press the UN to take responsibility for the cholera crisis in Haiti and undertake a meaningful response that moves the Haitian people toward a long term resolution of this public health crisis.”
A copy of the letter can be found HERE.
In the letter, the Senators state that the United States is in a unique position to facilitate a dialogue with the UN and other global partners and help implement a long-term sustainable health strategy to address the epidemic. Senators Markey and Rubio point to preventative measures such as developing nationwide water and sanitation systems, building latrines, enhancing access to medical facilities, and continuing to distribute hygiene interventions and vaccines to help respond to the cholera outbreak.

Cute is a word whose meaning has gone has gone through a thorough historical transformatio. There is no argument about cute’s derivation: it is a shortening of acute (and was sometimes actually spelled ‘cute). Acute has meant “clever, shrewd” since Shakespeare’s time and has had a set of other meanings as well, but it has never been defined as “attractive or pretty.” The contraction cute first appears in the early 18th century, but only a century later does it begin to take on its distinctive modern meaning; even after 1900 children were still being called cute as a compliment to their intelligence. (Compare the contemporaneous word cunning, with its strikingly similar ambiguity.) A few years into the century, we start to see the word—finally!—in descriptions of puppies and kittens. But the original sense hasn’t completely vanished; in such sentences as “Don’t get cute with me,” cute has nothing to do with adorable sweetness.

Obama Shows His True Colors as He Leaves Office

January 20, 2017 1:00 AM
President Obama at his final White House press conference, January 18, 2017. (Reuters photo: Joshua Roberts)	
With no reason to suppress his more radical instincts any longer, the president embraced them on his way out the door.
Barack Obama did not go out quietly. His unquiet final acts were overshadowed, in part by a successor who refused to come in quietly, and in part by Obama’s own endless, sentimental farewell tour. But there was nothing nostalgic or sentimental about Obama’s last acts. Two of them were simply shocking.
Perhaps we should have known. At the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, he joked about whether he had a bucket list: “Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.”
Advertisement

Turns out, he wasn’t kidding. Commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning, one of the great traitors of our time, is finger-in-the-eye willfulness. Obama took 28 years off the sentence of a soldier who stole and then released through WikiLeaks almost half a million military reports plus another quarter-million State Department documents.
The cables were embarrassing; the military secrets were almost certainly deadly. They jeopardized the lives not just of American soldiers on two active fronts — Iraq and Afghanistan — but of locals who were, at great peril, secretly aiding and abetting us. After Manning’s documents release, the Taliban “went on a killing spree” (according to intelligence sources quoted by Fox News) of those who fit the description of individuals working with the United States.
Moreover, we will be involved in many shadowy conflicts throughout the world. Locals will have to choose between us and our enemies. Would you choose a side that is so forgiving of a leaker who betrays her country — and you?
Advertisement

Even the word “leaker” is misleading. Leak makes it sound like a piece of information a whistleblower gives Woodward and Bernstein to expose misdeeds in high office. This was nothing of the sort. It was the indiscriminate dumping of a mountain of national-security secrets certain to bring harm to American troops, allies, and interests.
Obama considered Manning’s 35-year sentence excessive. On the contrary. It was lenient. Manning could have been — and in previous ages, might well have been — hanged for such treason. Now she walks after seven years.
What makes this commutation so spectacularly in-your-face is its hypocrisy. Here is a president who spent weeks banging the drums over the harm inflicted by WikiLeaks with its release of stolen materials and e-mails during the election campaign. He demanded a report immediately. He imposed sanctions on Russia. He preened about the sanctity of the American political process.
Over what? What exactly was released? A campaign chairman’s private e-mails and Democratic National Committee chatter, i.e. campaign gossip, backbiting, indiscretions, and cynicism. The usual stuff, embarrassing but not dangerous. No national-security secrets, no classified material, no exposure of anyone to harm, just to ridicule and opprobrium.
What better demonstration of bona fides than a gratuitous attack on Israel? Or the about-face on Manning and WikiLeaks?
The other last-minute Obama bombshell occurred four weeks earlier when, for the first time in nearly a half-century, the United States abandoned Israel on a crucial Security Council resolution, allowing the passage of a condemnation that will plague both Israel and its citizens for years to come. After eight years of reassurance, Obama seized the chance — free of political accountability for himself and his potential Democratic successor — to do permanent damage to Israel. (The U.S. has no power to reverse the Security Council resolution.)
Advertisement
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. who went on to be a great Democratic senator, once argued passionately that in the anti-American, anti-democratic swamp of the U.N., America should act unwaveringly in opposition and never give in to the jackals. Obama joined the jackals.
Advertisement
Why? To curry favor with the international Left? After all, Obama leaves office as a relatively young man of 55. His next chapter could very well be as a leader on the international stage, perhaps at the U.N. (secretary-general?) or some transnational (ostensibly) human-rights organization. What better demonstration of bona fides than a gratuitous attack on Israel? Or the about-face on Manning and WikiLeaks? Or the freeing of a still-unrepentant Puerto Rican terrorist, Oscar Lopez Rivera, also pulled off with three days remaining in his presidency?
Comments	
A more likely explanation, however, is that these are acts not of calculation but of authenticity. This is Obama being Obama. He leaves office as he came in: a man of the Left, but possessing the intelligence and discipline to suppress his more radical instincts. As of November 9, 2016, suppression was no longer necessary.
We’ve just gotten a glimpse of his real self. From now on, we shall see much more of it.

Experts Question Benefits of Fluoride-Free Toothpaste
While health authorities recognize fluoride as a cavity blocker, the internet is dotted with claims, often from "natural" toothpaste marketers and alternative medicine advocates, that fluoride-free toothpaste also prevents cavities

In this photo taken Friday, Aug. 3, 2018, Philippe Hujoel, a dentist and University of Washington professor, holds a toothbrush and toothpaste in an office at the school in Seattle. Dental health experts worry that more people are using toothpaste that skips the most important ingredient - the fluoride - and leaves them at a greater risk of cavities.
Dental health experts worry that more people are using toothpaste that skips the most important ingredient — fluoride — and leaves them at a greater risk of cavities.
Most toothpastes already contain fluoride. While health authorities recognize fluoride as a cavity blocker, the internet is dotted with claims, often from "natural" toothpaste marketers and alternative medicine advocates, that fluoride-free toothpaste also prevents cavities.
Dental authorities disagree.
"It's really important to debunk this idea that brushing your teeth stops decay. You need to have the fluoride," said Damien Walmsley, a scientific adviser to the British Dental Association and dentistry professor at the University of Birmingham.
All Charges Dropped Against 'Empire' Star Jussie Smollett
Cook County prosecutors abruptly dropped all charges against 'Empire' star Jussie Smollett in a stunning development. Prosecutors charged Smollett with filing a false police report following an alleged racist and homophobic attack by two men late January.
(Published 6 hours ago)
That view was underscored this week by an article in the dental journal Gerodontology that reviewed the scientific literature on cavities. Its primary conclusion is that, without fluoride, oral hygiene efforts have "no impact" on cavity rates.
The idea that just brushing teeth doesn't stop cavities has largely been accepted among individual researchers for decades, but not always by the public. Dentists generally recommend fluoride for cavity fighting, but even some of them continue to believe that the mechanics of wiping your teeth clean of plaque also reduces cavities. The review findings, published Monday, gave pause to at least one dentist.
"It violates certain principles we've been taught and that we teach and that we believe," said Richard Niederman, a dentist and professor at New York University who saw an advance copy of the study and found the findings credible. "What it says to me is that the toothbrush is just a delivery system."
Conor McGregor Announces Retirement on Social Media
Few studies of the question have been carried out in recent years because the value of fluoride has been widely accepted for decades. In the review, University of Washington researchers looked for high-quality studies since 1950 and found just three. They were carried out in the U.S. and Great Britain and published from 1977 to 1981. They involved a total of 743 children aged 10 to 13 years who flossed and brushed for up to three years.
When the studies were evaluated statistically as a whole, there was no significant cavity reduction from simply brushing or flossing without fluoride.
Dentist J. Leslie Winston, oral care director for Crest-toothpaste maker Procter & Gamble, said the review "serves as an important reminder."

"Despite a large body of scientific evidence, there are growing numbers of consumers who believe that all toothpastes are the same and that as long as you clean your teeth effectively with a toothbrush or other device which cleans in-between the teeth, you can prevent decay," he said in a statement.
The market share for fluoride-free toothpaste is closely held company data. Industry sources estimate it at no more than 5 percent of all toothpaste sold, but with projected growth of over 5 percent annually. On Monday, Tom's of Maine antiplaque and whitening toothpaste, which is fluoride-free, was listed as the second-best selling toothpaste on Amazon's online buying platform.
Paul Jessen, a brand manager at Tom's of Maine, said "the products that don't contain fluoride that we offer do not promise that benefit" to fight cavities. He said his company's customers generally understand this.
Uber Acquires Mideast Competitor Careem for $3.1 Billion
Yet customer comment on Amazon's website sometimes indicates otherwise, with many reviews insisting that the company's fluoride-free toothpaste does fight cavities. "If you brush regularly with or without fluoride, you reduce the risk of cavities," asserts one customer.
Oral care companies themselves also stray into such claims. The website of Revitin non-fluoride toothpaste says it "strengthens your teeth against tooth decay."
Gerald Curatola, the dentist who founded Revitin and now serves as chief science officer, called the review "misleading." He said that the latest science suggests that a healthy mix of oral bacteria is key to dental health. "I don't think fluoride makes a difference at all," he said.
AG Barr Says Mueller Probe Found No Russia Conspiracy
House Democrats are calling for the release of the full report from special counsel Robert Mueller, after a four-page summary from Trump appointee Attorney General William Barr say Mueller's team found no evidence of conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election season.
(Published Monday, March 25, 2019)
However, referring to his company's decay-fighting claim, he added: "After this call, I'm probably going to remove that from the website, because I don't think that should be on there, because I didn't know that was on there."
Jeff Davis, the CEO of Sheffield Pharmaceuticals that sells toothpaste with and without fluoride, said it's "pretty established" that fluoride is what helps reduce cavities. But he said some people worry about the harmful effect of too much fluoride and so choose fluoride-free toothpaste.
Even without fluoride, dentists say there's some value in brushing. Philippe Hujoel, the dentist and University of Washington professor who led the dental review, said oral hygiene without fluoride might produce real cavity-fighting effects too small to detect in a study, or adults might conceivably benefit where the children in the studies did not.
The Good, Bad and the Unknown of Apple's New Services
And toothbrushing did reduce swollen gums in Hujoel's review. Brushing the teeth may also dislodge stuck food and help patients recover from oral surgery.
Dentist Matthew Messina, a spokesman for the American Dental Association, said mechanical brushing can also help avoid decay that sometimes forms, especially in older people, at the normally hidden roots of teeth, which was outside the scope of this review.
"The study is important," he added, "because the study is supporting what we've been contending for a long time." The ADA recommends using fluoride toothpastes.

The review also cited a 2009 analysis of studies involving 60,000 people that found fluoride rinse prevents cavities about as well as fluoride toothpaste.
In 2016, The Associated Press reported on the poor scientific evidence for the benefits of flossing. As a result, the federal government removed its long-standing flossing recommendation from Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
The review raises questions about how cavities form. Cavities have long been thought to develop in a poorly cleaned mouth when acids left by food start to wear away tooth enamel. The idea is that clean teeth do not decay. This review, though, argues for an alternate model: cavities grow in tiny crevices in the enamel that can't easily be reached with a toothbrush or dental floss alone.

Despite the clear benefit of fluoride, some studies have also challenged the belief that fluoridated drinking water stops dental decay as well as fluoride toothpaste or rinses. In any event, it makes sense to combine fluoridated water and dental products for amplified protection, said Niederman, the NYU dentist.
Some dentists also said the most effective way to prevent cavities is simply to reduce sugars in the diet.

A Glimmer of Hope
NEIFPE member Anne Duff offers us this description of the recent visit to Fort Wayne by State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Glenda Ritz.
After Glenda Ritz beat Tony Bennett last fall for the position of Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Indiana, those of us who had been advocating for public education and had been working diligently spreading her name through mailing postcards, changing our Facebook profile pictures to her logo, and talking about her to friends, family and even strangers at the grocery store, were elated by her victory. Most people know by now that this was not only big news for Indiana, but for the country as well. Bennett had ten times the amount of money for his campaign, yet Glenda won 52% of the votes, earning more than even the governor, as often stated in the news.
But once the race was won, we didn't hear much. We didn't notice many changes, and as the legislative session began, it seemed to be a huge attack on public education. Vouchers were expanded, budgets were cut, programs were cut, and grading our schools A-F became law. Those of us who had been writing letters and talking to legislators in support of public education felt powerless as our voices had not been heard and our words written out of passion for our schools had not been read.
Last Wednesday a small glimmer of hope shined over those of us working so hard to effect change for public schools. Glenda Ritz spoke about her work as Superintendent of Public Instruction at the Future of Education conference held in Fort Wayne, IN. Her words inspired us to continue the fight even though this last legislative session made us feel as if all of our efforts had been ignored. She is working on eliminating the high-stakes, pass-fail assessments that we are currently using and working on implementing a true growth model assessment so teachers and students know how they are doing and what grade level they are working at; not just whether or not students can pass or fail a grade level test. She is coming up with a new teacher evaluation model instead of RISE that bases part of teacher evaluations on the high stakes tests. She is focusing on student centered learning instead of market-based education. She is a hero for public education. Slowly, yet deliberately and thoughtfully, she is trying to undo Tony Bennett's iniquities. There is definitely light at the end of the tunnel; there is hope for public education. What is right for our children and for public education shall prevail.

NEIFPE Mission Statement
We are citizens, teachers, administrators, and parents united by our support for public education and by concerns for its future. Recent federal and state reform measures have created an over-emphasis on testing and have turned over public education to private interests. We believe that these reforms threaten the well-being of our children and jeopardize their futures. Our goal is to inform ourselves and to start community discussion about the impact of these measures on our public schools and, more importantly, on our children.

NEIFPE Book Reviews
Locomotive ••
It is the summer of 1869, and trains, crews, and family are traveling together, riding America’s brand-new transcontinental railroad. These pages come alive with the details of the trip and the sounds, speed, and strength of the mighty locomotives; the work that keeps them moving; and the thrill of travel from plains to mountain to ocean.
Flora and Ulysses •
It begins, as the best superhero stories do, with a tragic accident that has unexpected consequences. The squirrel never saw the vacuum cleaner coming, but self-described cynic Flora Belle Buckman, who has read every issue of the comic book Terrible Things Can Happen to You!, is the just the right person to step in and save him.
Letters to a Young Teacher
Jonathan Kozol's most personally insightful and revealing work to date takes the form of encouraging letters to Francesca, a young classroom teacher, offering advice, personal stories, and a shared sense of outrage at the inadequacies of America's educational system.

Debt and Marriage: When Do I Owe My Spouse's Debts?
Whether you are liable for your spouse's debts depends on whether you live in a community property or equitable distribution state.
By Bethany K. Laurence, Attorney
Whether you and your spouse are liable for each other's debts depends mostly on where you live. In the handful of states with "community property" rules, most debts incurred by one spouse during the marriage are owed by both spouses. But in states that follow "common law" property rules, debts incurred by one spouse are usually that spouse's debts alone, unless the debt was for a family necessity, such as food or shelter for the family or tuition for the kids. (These are general rules; some states have subtle variations in how they treat joint and separate debts.)
These rules also apply to same-sex marriages in the states that allow them and to same-sex domestic partnerships and civil unions in states where those relationships are the equivalent of marriage, but not in states where the relationship does not confer all the rights of marriage.
Community Property States
The community property states are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. (In Alaska, spouses can sign an agreement making their assets community property, but few people choose to do this.)
Debts. In community property states, most debts incurred by either spouse during the marriage are owed by the "community" (the couple), even if only one spouse signed the paperwork for a debt. The key here is during the marriage. So if you incur a debt, such as a student loan, while you're single, and then get married, it won't automatically become a joint debt. (An exception is where a spouse signs on to an account as a joint account holder after getting married.) Some states, like Texas, have a more nuanced way of analyzing who owes what debts by evaluating who incurred the debt, for what purpose, and when.
After a legal separation or divorce, a debt is generally owed only by the spouse who incurred the debt, unless the debt was incurred for family necessities, to maintain jointly owned assets (for example, to fix a leaking roof), or if the spouses keep a joint account.
Income and property. In community property states, a couple's income is shared as well. All income earned by either spouse during marriage, as well as property bought with that income, is community property, owned equally by husband and wife. Gifts and inheritances received by one spouse, as well as separate property owned before marriage that's kept separate, are the separate property of one spouse. All income or property acquired before or after a divorce or permanent separation is also separate.
What property can be taken to pay debts? In a community property state, creditors of one spouse can go after the assets and income of the married couple to make good on joint debts (and remember, in a community property state, most debts incurred during marriage are considered joint debts).
Example
When Linda's business fails, she owes $45,000 to suppliers and other creditors. Because Linda and her husband live in a community property state, these creditors can sue both her and her husband to collect the money owed. Linda no longer has an income to take, but her husband's is significant, and her creditors are able to garnish $3,000 of her husband's income per month until the debts are paid off.
Creditors can go after joint assets in a community property state no matter whose name is on the title document to the asset. For example, a business owner's name may not be on the title to her spouse's boat, but in most community property states, that won't stop a creditor from suing in court to take the boat to pay off the business owner's debts (assuming the boat was purchased with community funds, and not separate funds).
As to one spouse's separate debt, such as one spouse's child support obligation from a prior relationship, or a debt in one spouse's name only where the spouse hid the fact that he or she was married, a creditor can go after only that spouse's half of the community property to repay the debt.
Removing a spouse's liability. Couples in community property states can sign an agreement with each other to have their debts and income treated separately. Signing a pre- or postnuptial agreement like this can make sense for a couple before one spouse goes into business. (But if you're already in business, signing an agreement now won't protect your spouse from liability for business debts that you already owe, only from liability for future business debts.)
You can also sign an agreement with a particular store, lender, or supplier, stating that the creditor will look solely to your separate property for repayment of any debt, essentially removing your spouse's liability for any obligation or debt from the contract -- if you can get the other party to agree.
Bankruptcy. Even if only one spouse files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in a community property state, all of the eligible community debts of both spouses will be discharged (wiped out).

Can ordinary citizens actually function as journalists? Or, as many in the mainstream media would have it, is journalism some sort of priesthood of professionals who venture, Moses-like, to mountaintops and then return to deliver the news as divinely revealed truth to the rest of us earthbound mortals?
In the wake of such recent citizen-mediated news events as the Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the London train bombings, Senator George Allen’s political suicide, the Virginia Tech massacre, et al, the real question is why anyone would still wonder about the possibility, much less the efficacy, of so-called ‘citizen journalism.’
Last week I traveled to Seoul, Korea to take part in an international gathering of ‘citizen reporters’ sponsored by an intriguing, cutting edge media firm called OhmyNews.com. OhmyNews is one of the most successful projects in the world involved in the burgeoning field of citizen journalism – wherein ‘amateur’ reporters participate in the creation and dissemination of news and information. The brainchild of Oh Yeon-ho, a professionally trained Korean journalist, OhmyNews was launched in February 2000 and has grown rapidly since. Today it boasts nearly 60,000 ‘citizen reporters’ worldwide, who work closely with dozens of professional staff members, creating content for websites in Korean, Japanese and English. Its corporate motto is “Every Citizen is a Reporter.”
Having already revolutionized the media environment in the Republic of Korea, Oh Yeon-ho is equally passionate about spreading the concepts and practices of citizen journalism worldwide. The OhmyNews ‘pro-am’ concept of combining citizen reporters with trained professional journalists and editors is rapidly becoming a model for other efforts around the world, and its annual forums on the topic are a key way of networking among the field’s leading theorists and practitioners. Featured speakers this year included Dan Gillmor of the Center for Citizen Media, Michael Tippit of NowPublic.com, McJoan of Daily Kos, and dozens of other presenters and panelists representing literally every continent, from Australia and Europe to Africa, Asia and the Americas. This year’s focus was “cross-cultural exchanges” and how they can contribute to the vision of the global village envisioned decades ago by Marshall McLuhan.

Oh Yeon-ho set the stage with his welcoming message, which accurately noted, “The question looming large is increasingly less about ‘digital opportunity’ and more about how we can best manage the abundance of content, Web platforms and user participation” now pouring forth. Oh also laid out “a host of pressing issues” including the need to balance user-created content with editorial accountability, as well as to identify business models to sustain citizen journalism during an age of ever-more rapid commercial and technical transitions and unclear revenue models.
Dan Gillmor - author of “We the Media” and long one of the movement’s leading theorists – noted in his keynote speech that, despite the many successes of citizen media thus far, “It is still early in the development and we still have far to go.” Like Oh, Gillmor believes that sustainable business models and issues of trust and accountability are highest on the agenda. He also urged all attending to “keep experimenting.” With the cost of doing so at an historic low, “There are very few institutional barriers to trying,” Gillmor concluded. And even in failure, he added, “We still learn. In fact, we usually learn more from failure than success!”
Panels on citizen journalism in Eastern Europe, South Africa and Australia, South Asia, and North America followed. Four new sites have appeared in the “emerging hotspots” of Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Estonia, and startups loom in South Africa and Australia as well. Meanwhile, Canada was well-represented by Michael Tippit of NowPublic.com, whose breakthrough deal to supply the Associated Press with citizen reports obtained through ‘crowdsourcing’ is a potential landmark in the struggle to gain both legitimacy and sustainability for citizen media efforts, and Joan (‘McJoan’ to Daily Kossacks) McCarter of the incredibly popular Daily Kos blog, read daily by about half a million people, spoke smartly on issues of transparency, credibility and accountability.

Of particular note was the announcement at the conference of the formation of a new South Asian Citizen Reporters Network. “Citizen journalism across borders is a vital question for Pakistan and India,” said one of SACRN’s founders, Pakistan’s Muhammad Aslam Khan. Fellow Punjabi Munish Naga of India echoed Aslam Khan’s analysis, saying, “It was because of citizen journalism that Aslam and I became close. And then the idea to form a network of South Asian citizen reporters emerged in our minds. Since then, SACRN has been growing day by day!”
We were also treated to a first-hand account of how Han Na-young, an OhmyNews citizen reporter living in Harrisonburg, Virginia, reported on the Virginia Tech massacre, working in close collaboration with the head of the OhmyNews international department for sixteen hours to bring written and photographic reports of the event to readers all over the world. The first day’s final session was devoted to an account of the recent expansion of OhmyNews into Japan with backing investment from SoftBank, a leading Japanese telecommunications and media corporation.
The conference’s closing sessions were devoted to a close examination of the related issues of ensuring editorial accountability and the search for a sustainable business model. First Oh Yeon-ho set forth what he called the “ten preconditions of valuable user-created content,” centering around issues of credibility, responsibility, influence and sustainability. Next he asked and answered the question “Why Citizen Journalism?” (Answers: to change traditional journalism; to find and create a new type of journalism; and “to change the world”) Finally Oh posed a larger, more philosophical question – one never asked in any corporate media suite: “Will more participation and better information make us happier and more fulfilled?”
The answer, Oh Yeon-ho posits, could be yes—provided that “participation is responsible, trustworthy, influential, solution-seeking, and sustainable.”
So can citizen journalism really change the world? Many skeptics still doubt it can even change the news industry, and still question, despite much evidence, whether ordinary citizens can really function as journalists. But why not? After all, I’ve been a professional journalist for decades – yet I never took a course in it, received a license for it, or even got anointed on high. So here’s my advice – if you don’t like the news, report some of your own!

Climate plans provoke backlash in Commission
Draft says agriculture must reform, too; feuds brewing within the Commission.
European Voice
By	Jennifer Rankin	
3/4/09, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 5:27 PM CET
EU policies on agriculture, transport and overseas aid may need to be overhauled to deal with unavoidable climate change, according to an early draft paper from the European Commission’s environment department. The draft has run into opposition from other Commission departments and is likely to be changed before a final version is launched on 2 April.
“Even if the world succeeds in limiting and then reducing emissions, our planet will take time to recover…we will be faced with the impacts of climate change over the next 50 years,” the paper says. The cost of failing to act could be €6 billion per year by 2020, but will “increase significantly” up to 2050 and beyond, according to the analysis.
Climate-friendly policies
The environment department wants to use these facts, mostly well known, as a springboard for all departments to ensure their policies are climate friendly. But the mammoth internal consultation involving 21 Commission departments has provoked disputes.
The most serious is with the Commission’s agriculture department, which believes it is already doing enough to ‘green’ its policy, and resents suggestions that the future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) needs to discourage “unsustainable practices” such as growing water-thirsty crops in arid regions. Officials there also oppose making specific proposals prematurely, for fear of pre-empting the debate on reforming the CAP after 2013.
Agricultural productivity
“We shouldn’t tie our hands too much at this stage,” said one official – echoing a view shared by the Commission’s budget department and the secretariat-general, too. The agriculture department recognises in a paper of its own that climate change could cut global agricultural productivity after 2050 and lead to more volatile prices.
The environment department also explores whether the EU should impose mandatory climate impact assessments on any new road or gas and electricity network funded by the EU, or regulate improvements in water efficiency for farms, households and buildings. While it accepts that most actions on climate change adaptation will have to be taken by national, regional or local governments, the environment department argues that the EU has a useful co-ordinating role, and could create a “clearing house mechanism” to help member states share information. If member states agree, this could be up and running by 2011. The department also wants to create a panel of national experts by September 2009 to implement the white paper’s ideas.
Fact File
€6bn
Estimated cost per year by 2020 of failing to deal with climate change
Hardest hit regions
Southern European countries and the Arctic will be hardest hit by climate change, according to the paper. But the problems of more frequent outbreaks of disease, more deaths as a result of extreme weather and rising sea levels will go well beyond these vulnerable regions.
Ministers are expected to discuss in June how the EU will adapt to climate change.

Time running out for CEECs to benefit from EU cultural programmes
CENTRAL and eastern European countries hoping to benefit from cultural funding will lose out unless they act swiftly before the programmes expire, warn senior European Commission officials.
European Voice
By	Leyla Linton	
12/17/97, 5:00 PM CET
Updated 4/12/14, 2:46 AM CET
Although all the applicant countries have told the Commission that they are keen to take part, only six - the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and Bulgaria - have convinced the Commission that they can make the financial commitment necessary to do so.
Until recently, central and eastern countries wishing to take part in EU cultural programmes did not have to 'match' money from Union coffers with an equivalent sum from their own pockets.
From now on, however, they will be treated in the same way as the EU's 15 existing member states and will only get out of the cultural budget as much as they put in.
Officials in the Commission's Directorate-General for culture and audio-visual policy (DGX) stress that time is running out for the applicant countries concerned to come forward with their budget plans and meet the deadlines for responding to calls for proposals for EU-funded cultural projects, as the Union's cultural programmes are coming to an end.
Ariane, which funds literary and translation projects, and Kaleidoscope, which aids cross-border cooperation, are both due to expire at the end of next year, and Raphael, which supports heritage projects, is due to finish at the end of 1999.
Officials say that if applicant countries are ready to apply by March next year, they will still have a chance to participate in cultural projects. But a senior official warned: "They need to be quick."

OUR SERVICES
Polsinelli Optometry is happy to offer comprehensive eye health and vision care for infants, children, and adults.
WHAT IS A COMPREHENSIVE EYE HEALTH AND VISION EXAM?
Examinations include refraction, eye movement and coordination, depth perception, color vision, pupillary testing, peripheral and central vision screening, glaucoma and cataract check, dry eye and allergy assessment, macular degeneration evaluation, and full dilated health evaluation. ​
Dr. Polsinelli recommends yearly eye exams, the first to start at 6 months of age. Patients with healthy eyes can be seen every one to two years. ​Individuals with diseases such as glaucoma, diabetes, or macular degeneration may be seen at shorter intervals. ​
CONTACT LENS EVALUATION AND FITTING
​Dr. Polsinelli fits soft, bifocal, gas permeable, and specialty contact lenses for various conditions such as keratoconus or astigmatism. First, your vision is checked with your prescription, then eye health, size, shape, and curvature are evaluated. Dr. Polsinelli then decides based on your lifestyle, and other variables what lens would be most successful for you. He then checks the fit, comfort and fine tunes the prescription to make sure everything is optimum. He will teach you insertion and removal of the lens, how to clean and care for the lens, and what you can and cannot do with the lens. He has a particular passion for fitting multi-focal contact lenses for presbyopia patients to see both far and near.
CORNEAL REFRACTIVE THERAPY (CRT)
Our practice is offering a new technology called Corneal Refractive Therapy, or CRT. It is a process that allows you to wear a special contact lens while you sleep so that you can see during the day without wearing corrective lenses or glasses. Ask us about CRT during your appointment.
​For more information, visit www.paragonvision.com/crt-lenses/
VISION THERAPY AND REHABILITATION
Vision therapy is a great way to help patients develop and improve visual skills and function. Vision therapy can also improve visual comfort, ease, and efficiency. It can help with visual processing of information. Various exercises, therapeutic lenses, prisms, filters, patches, and other techniques can help improve a weakness in the visual system. Some conditions that are treated with vision therapy are amblyopia, strabismus, convergence insufficiency, focusing spasms/eye strain, and eye tracking problems related to reading.
​PRESCRIPTION EYE WEAR AND SUNGLASSES
We take a lot of time to try and find the best products to use for our patients. We can offer our patients the latest innovations in frames and lens design and materials on the market. We understand how to take what the doctor prescribed and fit it into a frame that functions properly. Stop on by today for a fitting!
PRE AND POST-OPERATION MANAGEMENT OF LASIK
​Polsinelli Optometry will screen you for a LASIK consult. We will only recommend the best surgeons to do the procedure that works for your eyes. We will provide all of the post operative examinations.
DRY EYE TREATMENT
Dry eye syndrome is experienced more and more by Americans, especially since we are staring at computer screens all day and forgetting to blink. Dry eye can be caused by the environment, various diseases such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, medications such as oral contraceptives, and even menopause. Dr. Polsinelli will evaluate all 3 layers of your tear film matrix, eye lid margin and glands, and will go over any potential conditions that may be making it worse. He will come up with a plan to help you overcome the discomfort from dry eye. Common treatments Dr. Polsinelli uses successfully are artificial tears, omega-3 supplementation, punctal occlusion, and Restasis.
ALLERGIES OF THE EYE
​Are your eyes itchy, watery, or even swollen? Dr. Polsinelli can help relieve them with prescription eye drops.
​EYE INFECTIONS
There are many different kinds of eye infections. It can be viral, bacterial, allergic, or even fungal. Dr. Polsinelli will determine what type of infection you have and treat it accordingly. It's important to see an eye doctor for eye infections since they have the instruments to properly diagnose infection.
GLAUCOMA
Visual loss from glaucoma results from characteristic deterioration of the optic nerve leading to progressive loss of the field of vision. At least 3 million Americans suffer from glaucoma. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of adult blindness, and it is also the leading cause of preventable blindness. Because glaucoma usually does not manifest any symptoms until extensive peripheral visual loss becomes apparent in the final stages of the disease, it is often likened to the "sneak thief of sight." Unlike most eye diseases, most varieties of glaucoma are chronic, virtually lifelong disorders than can be controlled but not cured.
​EMERGENCY EYE CARE
Dr. Polsinelli is available around the clock for someone who needs emergency eye care. Contact our office immediately if there is a problem with your eye health or vision. If you can not get in touch with us, please go to your local emergency room.
FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT
Polsinelli Optometry is proud to announce the all new Humphrey Matrix Perimeter with Frequency Doubling Technology and Canon's CR-2 retinal camera.
The Humphrey Matrix is an ideal aid for detecting visual field loss associated with glaucoma and other diseases. Clinically verified in over 170 peer-reviewed journal articles, the Humphrey FDT brings the highest standard of perimetry.
The Canon's CR-2 retinal camera is the latest development from Canon and provides a new level of diagnostic capabilities delivering and storing high-resolution images of your retina. Capturing disease on camera allows for proper monitoring of progression. Healthy eyes can also be captured for future comparison.
TYPES OF PAYMENT ACCEPTED
​We accept Cash, Personal Checks, Debit Card, American Express, Master Card, Visa, and Discover.
​*We accept flexible spending and health savings accounts!*
INSURANCE PLANS

Costs of outpatient versus inpatient knee replacement a clear area of contention in wake of report.
Last week seemed to be a quiet time on the Medicare regulatory front. Perhaps the three-day government shutdown resulted in things ramping back up, however.
For a while I thought I’d have nothing to talk about besides total knee replacements for RACmonitor eNews readers. If you haven’t heard about that, you better listen to my RACmonitor.com webinar right away. It’s quite confusing, and there is a lot of revenue at stake.
Fortunately, my lack of a new topic vanished at noon last Friday, when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released its 37-page report titled 2017: A Year of Accomplishment. This thoroughly comprehensive review of seemingly every activity undertaken by every division of HHS, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will probably not be read by many, but I read it, or at least up to page 5, when my jaw dropped.
What got my hairs to stand on end? Well, HHS claimed as an accomplishment the following: “CMS removed procedures from the inpatient-only list (in the Outpatient Prospective Payment System Rule, or OPPS), giving patients greater choice to decide which site of service is right for them for six procedures, including total knee replacements, one of the most common and costly procedures. Medicare beneficiaries will now have the option to seek care in a lower cost setting of care (i.e., an outpatient setting rather than a more expensive inpatient setting.)”
Is this blatantly wrong? It sure is, and let me explain why, point by point. First of all, patients never have a choice of whether they are inpatients or outpatients. We all know that doctors need to follow the rules no matter what the patient “decides.” Now, I will admit that CMS did say in the OPPS rule that doctors may consider patient preferences when determining the status for total knee replacement (stating at 82 FR 59383 that “the decision regarding the most appropriate care setting for a given surgical procedure is a complex medical judgment made by the physician based on the beneficiary’s individual clinical needs and preferences.”) But CMS provided absolutely no details on how much weight we are allowed to give to patient preference, or whether that preference needs to be rational or meet any standard of medical necessity.
HHS also noted that total knee replacement is one of the most costly procedures. Perhaps they are unaware that CMS has a list of prices of procedures that is available to the public, and that from that list anyone could see that there are 185 procedures that are equally expensive or more expensive for outpatients than total knee replacement. Now I will agree that a knee replacement is a bit more expensive than the last item on the list, which is a half-milligram dose of diclofenac costing 19 cents, but knee replacement is a heck of a lot less costly than a prosthetic retina at $122,000.
HHS also claims that the inpatient setting is more expensive than outpatient. Oh really? Maybe they should tell AARP and NBC News that, since they both encourage patients to insist on inpatient admission because it is less costly. They must also have a bit of amnesia about the fact that self-administered mediations are not covered as outpatient, but are covered as inpatient, and that they can add a couple hundred dollars to an outpatient visit. And they conveniently seemed to have forgotten that if a patient had a Part A stay within the prior 60 days, their total knee replacement performed as an inpatient procedure will cost them absolutely nothing.
Because it can be confusing, let me review the cost for a knee replacement as inpatient or outpatient. If done as inpatient, the patient is responsible for the Part A deductible of $1,340, with no other out-of-pocket costs at all. If done as outpatient, the patient is responsible for their Part B deductible of $183, then a 20 percent coinsurance on the approved amount of each line-item charge incurred during the hospital stay. But since total knee replacement is classified as a comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), there is only one line-item charge that is approved. And that coinsurance is capped at the inpatient deductible per approved line item, hence the patient owes a maximum of $1,340. But, as noted above, self-administered drugs are excluded from Part B coverage, so if the hospital charges for those (and more hospitals are electing not to charge for them), then the patient must pay that cost. In other words, an inpatient total knee replacement will cost the same or be less costly than an outpatient surgery.
An outpatient total knee replacement also means that if the patient has preoperative testing performed in the three calendar days prior to surgery, the patient will be responsible for their 20 percent coinsurance on each test. If they have surgery as an inpatient, almost all services provided to the patient at the hospital or any hospital-owned facility is bundled into the payment for the admission. So one can add this as more reason why inpatient total knee replacement is less expensive than outpatient surgery.
Furthermore, HHS totally ignores the fact that the only way a patient can access their Part A skilled nursing facility benefit is if they have an inpatient admission of three or more days. Of course, HHS could fix that by waiving the requirement; we all know that many organizations have begged for the 1960s-era rule to be changed, but so far those pleas have fallen on deaf ears.
I am sure that the political turmoil of 2017, including the resignation of the HHS Secretary after the private jet scandal and the negative publicity over the banning the use of seven words or phrases by CDC employees, led the Trump administration to determine that it had to tout the accomplishments of HHS as a counterpoint.
But perhaps when they draft their 2018 accomplishment list next year, they should have it fact-checked by career staff within each division and avoid publishing fake news.

GB&I aiming to defend trophy won in 2015 at Royal Lytham & St Annes
GB&I will be aiming to defend the trophy after securing a 16½-9½ victory in the 2015 match at Royal Lytham & St Annes; their biggest winning margin since the match was first played in 1922.
A ten-player team and two reserves have been named for the 2017 match with five Englishmen featuring alongside two Scots, two Welshmen and one player from Ireland.
The GB&I team includes The Amateur champion Harry Ellis, the Silver Medal Winner at The Open and European Amateur champion Alfie Plant, the Lytham Trophy champion Jack Singh Brar and the winner of the St Andrews Links Trophy Matthew Jordan. Last year’s Amateur champion Scott Gregory is joined in the team by the man he defeated in the final Robert MacIntyre.
Craig Watson, who will be captaining the GB&I team for the first time in the match, said, “We have been very impressed with the performances of many of the GB&I players so far this season and it has been a difficult decision to select only ten players.
“The Walker Cup match is one of the highlights of the golfing calendar and a tremendous opportunity for the players to shine on such a big stage. The Americans will be determined not to lose two matches in a row but we have selected a strong team and I’m sure the players will give it their all to try to retain the trophy.”

Getting clean and sober from Fioricet, Chlordiazepoxide, alcohol or any other addictive drugs you or your loved one is addicted to takes an specifically-tailored treatment arrangement. Two options of substance addiction treatment programs in Allen can help you succeed: either Inpatient or Out-patient Rehabilitation. Residential care offers long lasting benefits with extended residence in an excellent rehabilitation clinic. Outpatient treatment options may be more convenient to you, but lack the constancy and assets of thirty-day programs to get clean. Ultimately, you make the decision, and we are here to help you make the right choice.

Isolating yourself from the conditions of the substance problem can help eradicate disruptions and temptations that prevent you from recovering. When viewing rehab as a therapeutic haven, addicts will find exclusive private centers in cities outside of Allen, Kentucky. Offering resort-like amenities, the top-rated clinics help achieve a state of physical, psychological and emotional recovery. However, those looking for outpatient regimen may find a facility closer to home is a simpler choice.

For instance, an addiction to heroin, Adderall, cocaine or Xanax combined with schizophrenia or compulsive shopping. For these people, a residential rehab center is often imperative, incorporating quality inpatient treatments with group support, such as one might experience in Narcotics Anonymous. Luxury drug rehabs in Allen, Kentucky will provide excellent rehab services with upscale amenities for anyone requiring the very best drug rehab experience, just as Allen alcohol rehab centers will help those battling alcohol to attain sobriety.

Dozens killed in shooting attacks on New Zealand mosques
Praveen Menon, Charlotte Greenfield
7 Min Read
WELLINGTON/CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - A gunman shot dead 49 people and wounded more than 40 at two New Zealand mosques on Friday, some as they were kneeling at prayer, livestreaming online some of the killings in what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called an assault on the nation’s values.
The gunman broadcast footage of the attack on one mosque in the city of Christchurch on Facebook, mirroring the carnage played out in video games, after publishing a “manifesto” in which he denounced immigrants, calling them “invaders”.
The video footage widely circulated on social media, apparently taken by a gunman and posted live online as the attack unfolded, showed him driving to a mosque, entering it and shooting randomly at people inside.
Worshippers, possibly dead or wounded, lay huddled on the floor, the video showed. Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
It was the worst ever mass killing in New Zealand and the country raised its security threat level to the highest, Ardern said, adding, “This can now only be described as a terrorist attack.”
Police said three people were in custody including one man in his late 20s who had been charged with murder. He will appear in court on Saturday. Police have identified none of the suspects.
“We were not chosen for this act of violence because we condone racism, because we are enclave for extremism,” Ardern said in a national address. “We were chosen for the fact that we are none of these things. It was because we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values.
“You have chosen us but we utterly reject and condemn you.”
Police Commissioner Mike Bush said 49 people had been killed. Health authorities said 48 people were being treated for gunshot wounds, including young children.
Leaders around the world expressed sorrow and disgust at the attacks, with some deploring the demonization of Muslims.
U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the “horrible massacre” in what the White House called a “vicious act of hate”.
The gunman’s manifesto praised Trump as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose”. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

‘SHOOTING EVERYONE IN THE MOSQUE’
One man who said he was at the Al Noor mosque told media the gunman was white, blond and wearing a helmet and a bulletproof vest. The man burst into the mosque as worshippers were kneeling for prayers.
“He had a big gun...He came and started shooting everyone in the mosque, everywhere,” said the man, Ahmad Al-Mahmoud. He said he and others escaped by breaking through a glass door.
Forty-one people were killed at the Al Noor mosque, seven at a mosque in the Linwood neighborhood and one died in hospital, police said. Hospitals said children were among the victims.
The visiting Bangladesh cricket team was arriving for prayers at one of the mosques when the shooting started but all members were safe, a team coach told Reuters.
Three Bangladeshis were among the dead and one was missing, the consulate said.
Shortly before the attack began, an anonymous post on the discussion site 8chan, known for a wide range of content including hate speech, said the writer was going to “carry out an attack against the invaders” and included links to a Facebook livestream, in which the shooting appeared, and a manifesto.
The manifesto cited “white genocide”, a term typically used by racist groups to refer to immigration and the growth of minority populations, as his motivation.
The Facebook link directed users to the page of a user called brenton.tarrant.9.
A Twitter account with the handle @brentontarrant posted on Wednesday images of a rifle and other military gear decorated with names and messages connected to white nationalism. What looked like the same weapons appeared in the livestream of the mosque attack on Friday.
Facebook said it had deleted the gunman’s accounts “shortly after the livestream commenced” after being alerted by police. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all said they had taken steps to remove copies of the videos.
KILLINGS CONDEMNED
It was not immediately clear if the attacks at the two mosques were carried out by the same man.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said one of the men in custody was Australian.

All mosques in New Zealand had been asked to shut their doors and post armed guards, police said, adding they were not actively looking for any other “identified suspects”.
Political and Islamic leaders across Asia and the Middle East condemned the killings and voiced concern over the targeting of Muslims.
“I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11,” Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan posted on social media. “1.3 billion Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror.”
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated “the urgency of working better together globally to counter Islamophobia and eliminate intolerance and violent extremism in all its forms,” a spokesman said.
Six Indonesians had been inside one of the mosques, with three managing to escape and three unaccounted for, its foreign minister said.
Afghanistan’s ambassador said three Afghans had been wounded. Two Malaysians were wounded, their foreign ministry said.
Muslims account for just over 1 percent of New Zealand’s population, a 2013 census showed.
“FIRING WENT ON AND ON’
The online footage, which appeared to have been captured on a camera strapped to a gunman’s head, showed him driving as music played in his vehicle. After parking, he took two guns and walked a short distance to the mosque where he opened fire.
Over the course of five minutes, he repeatedly shot worshippers, leaving more than a dozen bodies in one room alone. He returned to the car during that period to change guns, and went back to the mosque to shoot anyone showing signs of life.
One man, with blood still on his shirt, said in a television interview that he hid from a gunman under a bench and prayed that he would run out of bullets.
“I was just praying to God and hoping our God, please, let this guy stop,” Mahmood Nazeer told TVNZ.
“The firing went on and on. One person with us had a bullet in her arm. When the firing stopped, I looked over the fence, there was one guy, changing his gun.”
The video shows the gunman then driving off at high speed and firing from his car. Another video, taken by someone else, showed police apprehending a gunman on a pavement by a road.

Police said improvised explosive devices were found. The gunman’s video had shown red petrol canisters in the back of his car, along with weapons.
Violent crime is rare in New Zealand and police do not usually carry guns. Before Friday, New Zealand’s worst mass shooting was in 1990 when a gun-mad loner killed 13 men, women and children in a 24-hour rampage in the tiny seaside village of Aramoana. He was killed by police.

Chris Stapleton is nominated in a leading five categories at the 2018 CMA Awards.

The Country Music Association announced the nominees for the 52nd annual CMA Awards on Tuesday morning in Nashville, with Chris Stapleton leading all nominees with five. The bearded, big-voiced singer-songwriter scored nods in the Entertainer, Album, Male Vocalist, Song and Single of the Year categories on the strength of his album From A Room: Volume 2 and his first-ever Number One song on the Country Airplay chart, “Broken Halos.”
Producer-musician Dann Huff followed Stapleton with four nominations, for his work with Midland, Keith Urban and Thomas Rhett, while a host of artists scored three nods: Jason Aldean, Dierks Bentley, Dan + Shay, Florida Georgia Line, Chris Janson, Miranda Lambert, Midland, Thomas Rhett and Keith Urban.
The Album of the Year category is particularly strong this year, with Stapleton’s From A Room: Volume 2, Keith Urban’s Graffiti U, Thomas Rhett’s Life Changes, Dierks Bentley’s The Mountain and Kacey Musgraves’ Golden Hour all in the race. Musgraves is also nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year.
Both Luke Combs and Chris Janson also had impressive showings. Janson scored his first-ever CMA Awards nominations, two for his ballad “Drunk Girl” and a New Artist of the Year nomination, while Combs landed a New Artist nod and a surprise Male Vocalist of the Year nomination.
The awards will be handed out when the CMAs air live November 14th at 8:00 p.m/ET on ABC from Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena. Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley return to host.

Additional Information
Description
Ovation is your perfectly comfortable Men’s sandal. SAS Tripad® Technology cushions your foot at its three main pressure points offering unparalleled comfort. A contoured insole wrapped in soft leather cradles the curves and arches of your foot to give you maximum support. A leather lining completely cushions and protects the foot. Step into perfect comfort with Ovation.
Heel Height: 1.50".
Product Details
The initial fit of this sandal should allow the foot to settle naturally into the foot bed so that your foot sits inside the edge of the insole all the way around. This allows plenty of room for your toes to spread out and no area of the foot is pinched. The front strap should lie comfortably across the top of the foot and the back strap should be snug against the sides and back of the heel..
Genuine Leather Upper: A genuine aniline leather upper stretches over our exclusive last, which follows the natural shape of the foot, to shape the sandal for a proper fit.
Contoured Insole:The lightweight insole has a full-length shock absorbing cushion and shapes to the natural arches and curves of your foot for comfortable support.
Adjustable Comfort:Two adjustable SAS EZ Straps™ allow you to customize the fit of the sandal to your foot. The adjustability is also enhanced by an elasticized buckle on the ankle strap fitted to secure and flex with your foot as you walk.
All Day Comfort Sole:A roomy sole base provides increased stability and maximum shock absorbency. This feature, along with the contoured insole, works to add bounce to each step and provide you with all-day cushioned comfort.

Floods: A question of competence?
From www.bbc.co.uk -	February 12, 2014 2:09 PM
Charlotte Maddrell's insight:
This sparks an interesting consideration of the relative importance of human and physical contributions to flooding impacts...is it the hazard, the vulnerability or the capacity to respond which is most to blame for the UK floods becoming a national 'disaster'? Bear in mind that this particular article is heavily weighted to consideration of the political landscape and political ramifications of the flooding but there is a lot of other evidence around to add to the debate.
This is what I would like you to do over the holidays. Gather evidence for all of the elements of the disaster risk equation and build an argument for which you think is most to blame.
And yes, it should be an essay. At least 2 sides typed. Clearly structured to show your argument. You may devise your own title but make sure it asks a question which meets the parameters of the task.

The Arc of Illinois Responds to Chicago Tribune Series
Posted on December 12, 2016 by Mike Nagel	
The Chicago Tribune published a two-part series (part 1, part 2) about the troubling conditions inside Illinois group homes and the lack of proper oversight by the state, portraying the conditions as a natural result of deinstitutionalization. In response, Executive Director Tony Paulauski and Board President Terri Devine each wrote letters to the editor expressing the importance of community living and calling on legislators to reform the system and fund a living wage for direct support professionals. Paulauski wrote: “‘Suffering in Secret'” has identified serious problems, but it also should remind Rauner and legislators that Illinois can no longer continue to fund an obsolete institutional system at the expense of community services. It is time to close six of the seven fully operational state institutions in Illinois. It is time to invest those resources into home- and community-based services. It is time for Illinois to step up and transform the disability system here in Illinois like Indiana and 14 other states that have closed those obsolete state institutions.”

Patriots owner Robert Kraft accused of soliciting prostitute
Kraft’s representatives deny he engaged in any illegal activity.

Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, faces charges of soliciting a prostitute after he was twice videotaped in a sex act at a shopping-centre massage parlour in Florida, police said Friday.
The 77-year-old Kraft denied any wrongdoing. The case comes amid a crackdown on sex trafficking from Palm Beach to Orlando in which police planted cameras in massage parlours.

Kraft was not immediately arrested. Jupiter police said a warrant will be issued and his attorneys will be notified. They said details about the misdemeanour charges against the owner of the Super Bowl champion team will not be released until next week.
Hundreds of arrest warrants have been issued in recent days as a result of the six-month investigation, and more are expected. Ten spas have been closed, and several people have been taken into custody on sex trafficking charges.
Jupiter Police Chief Daniel Kerr said he was shocked to learn that Kraft, who is worth $6 billion, was paying for sex inside a shopping-centre massage parlour, the Orchids of Asia Day Spa. “We are as equally stunned as everyone else,” Kerr said.
Most people charged for the first time with soliciting a prostitute in Florida are allowed to enter a diversion program, said attorney David Weinstein, a former prosecutor. Kraft would probably have to perform 100 hours of community service and attend a course on the harmful effects of prostitution and sex trafficking, he said.
The arrest could also get Kraft in trouble with the NFL, which in a statement said only that it is “aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developments.”
Under league policy, players, owners, coaches and other employees can be punished for “conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in” the NFL.
“Ownership and club or league management have traditionally been held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline,” the policy says.
The Patriots won the Super Bowl this month over the Los Angeles Rams for their sixth NFL championship in the past 18 seasons, making them the most successful team in pro sports during that span. Before the Super Bowl, several retired NFL players appeared in a public service announcement decrying sexual exploitation and human trafficking in Atlanta, the host city.
Kraft lives in Massachusetts and has a home in the Palm Beach area. Though he is a Democrat, he is friendly with President Donald Trump and a frequent guest at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club. Kraft’s wife, Myra Hiatt Kraft, died in 2011. He has been dating 39-year-old actress Ricki Noel Lander since 2012.
“Well it’s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He’s proclaimed his innocence, totally,” Trump said at the White House on Friday.
In a statement, Kraft’s representatives said they “categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.”
The spa Kraft allegedly visited is in a busy, upper-middle-class shopping centre with neighbours that include a dentist, a real estate office, surf and bike shops and a Publix supermarket.

Confinement measures, such as warning signs and fencing, around Olympia's Capitol Lake to keep the New Zealand mud snail from spreading may be working, according to a draft report. A survey of water bodies within five miles of the lake show no signs of the invasive creature. The Olympian
The South Sound invasion of the New Zealand mud snail appears confined to Capitol Lake, according to a recent scientific survey.
Lakes and streams within a 5-mile radius of the lake were surveyed at 85 locations. No New Zealand mud snails were found, according to a draft report prepared for the state by Deixus Consultants of Seattle.
The tiny, non-native snail was discovered in Capitol Lake in October 2009. The lake has been closed to boating and other recreation use since November 2009 in a bid to keep the rapidly reproducing mollusk from spreading.
“The survey is a sign that the quarantine is working and the infestation is fairly isolated to the lake,” said Allen Pleus, aquatic nuisance species coordinator for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Trump: “Terrific Day Hearing Softbank Terms&Conditions #NeverEnoughID #IllNeverGetThose4HoursBack”
Dec 7, 2016
President-elect Donald Trump has spent all day finalizing a business deal with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son providing sufficient identification and listening to an extraordinarily long list of contract terms and conditions.
Trump secured the contract with Son, in which Softbank will invest $50 billion in the US and bring 50,000 jobs, before realizing he would have to go and retrieve more ID and sit through hours of legal fine print explanations.
“After term and condition number 4, I just kept nodding my head,” Trump told reporters.
During the meeting Trump was asked if he had a hanko stamp, and it was at this point he began to regret starting the contract process.
“Do I look like I own a hanko? Of course I’m going to sign. This is some bullshit,” Trump tweeted during the meeting.
Despite spending most of the day with Son, Trump was still unable to ascertain why an African American has a white dog for a father.

President Donald Trump will visit Northeast Pennsylvania on Aug. 2 to rally support for U.S. Rep Lou Barletta’s campaign for the U.S. Senate.
The president will appear at 7 p.m. at Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, 255 Highland Park Blvd., Wilkes-Barre Twp. Doors will open at 4 p.m., and registration is required to enter the rally. Registrants can receive up to two tickets per cellphone number registered on Trump’s website at donaldjtrump.com.
“I am very excited to have President Trump join me in Pennsylvania to show his strong support for our campaign for U.S. Senate,” Barletta, R-11, Hazleton, said in a statement.
Trump last visited the region the night before winning the presidency in 2016. He spoke at Lackawanna College’s student center. He also spoke at the student center in July 2016. During the campaign, he also rallied voters twice at the Wilkes-Barre Twp. arena.
Barletta is vying with U.S. Sen. Bob Casey for the senate seat. A Franklin & Marshall College poll released in mid-June showed Casey leading Barletta by 17 percentage points.
Local businessman Bob Bolus plans to attend the rally with his Trump truck — a tractor trailer bearing messages of support for the president.
“Lou Barletta, in my opinion, is a gem,” Bolus said.
Events like Trump’s upcoming visit “rally the troops and help kick off the campaign,” said Lance Stange Jr., chairman of the Republican Party of Lackawanna County, adding that Trump’s early rallying is “definitely a positive.”
“I think it shows the importance of the region and the importance of the race that the president would come in and do an event for Congressman Barletta,” Stange said.

Jussie Smollett Put in 2 Days Community Service With Rainbow PUSH Coalition
1
3/26/2019 1:52 PM PDT
Exclusive Details
Jussie Smollett ﻿logged a total of 18 hours of community service over 2 days -- with Jesse Jackson's organization, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition -- and that was enough to satisfy prosecutors in Chicago.
Honchos at Rainbow PUSH -- a civil and human rights organization -- tell us, Jussie volunteered for the first time Saturday, putting in 8 hours from 10 AM to 6 PM. He just completed another 10 hours on Monday.
We're told Jussie's "service" included stuffing membership envelopes, working in the group's bookstore to sell merchandise ... and critiquing its Saturday broadcast. We're told he helped them with camera angles, and also worked with the music director on a plan to build the choir.
A Rainbow PUSH rep says it was their decision, not Jussie's, to keep his work with them under wraps. The rep added that they viewed his efforts as volunteering, not community service. Point being ... Jussie never mentioned his deal with prosecutors. Remember, the prosecutor's office says it was in discussions with Smollett's camp for weeks about dropping the charges.
Another group, the Black AIDS Institute, wrote a letter in support of Jussie.
We're told he planned and hosted a December gala for the group -- which is based in L.A. -- but we're told he hasn't done any work with them since his arrest. So, the letter speaks more to his character than any Chicago community service.

Ranking Roger General Public Singer Dead at 56
1
3/26/2019 3:37 PM PDT
Ranking Roger, the co-founder of General Public and English Beat singer, died Tuesday after battling cancer.
English Beat announced Roger Charley's death ... telling fans he had "sadly passed away peacefully at home with his family by his side earlier today. Roger's family would like to thank everyone for their constant support during this tough time. Roger was a fighter."
Roger reportedly suffered a stroke last summer and was diagnosed with two brain tumors and lung cancer -- but no cause of death has been released yet.
The late singer was born in Birmingham, England, and fell in love with punk rock as a teenager. He went on to play drums with a group called the Dum Dum Boys ... before joining The English Beat in the late 1970s.
After The English Beat broke up in 1983, Roger and fellow Beat alum, Dave Wakeling started their new group, General Public ... which also included former members of The Clash and Dexys Midnight Runners.
GP recorded 3 albums, and their biggest hit in the U.S. was 1984's "Tenderness."
Roger was 56. RIP

Jussie Smollett Criminal Case Dropped!!! Mayor Calls It a 'Whitewash of Justice'
1
3/26/2019 1:06 PM PDT
1:05 PM PT -- ﻿First Assistant to the Cook County State Attorney Joseph Magats -- who replaced Kim Foxx when she recused herself -- says they dropped the charges because Smollett doesn't have a violent criminal history, and lying about the alleged attack was not a violent crime.
Magats says his office prioritizes violent crimes in Chicago, and felt this case wouldn't be the best use of resources. For the record, he says he made this decision alone ... without consultation from Foxx.
He also squarely says he believes Jussie DID concoct a hoax and lied about it to police. Even though Chicago PD and Mayor Emanuel ripped the State's Attorney's Office ... Magats made it clear he stands by the findings of the cops, and believes they had the evidence to get a conviction.
The obvious question is asked ... why take the case to a grand jury, only to drop the charges? Check out Magats' answer -- a lot of people, and not just Chicago PD, won't buy what he's selling here.
BTW, Magats says discussions have been going on for weeks with Jussie's camp ... about dropping the charges, and his community service. All of which must have been done in total secrecy because we know cops, the Mayor and others involved in the case had no clue this was going to happen.
10:45 AM PT -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel is very strongly hinting at corruption in the State's Attorney's Office, calling the decision to drop the charges against Smollett a "whitewash of justice."
The Mayor added, "From top to bottom, this is not on the level." He called for accountability from the prosecutors.
Emanuel was joined by Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson who said he didn't feel justice was served by letting Smollett off the hook.
What's more, Johnson said if Jussie was, in fact, innocent ... he should've taken his day in court, and not broker a backdoor deal in secrecy. Bigger picture -- Johnson feels the City of Chicago is still owed an apology, as he believes Jussie carried out a hoax.
10:15 AM PT -- FOX says, "Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed."
As for WHY they were dropped -- you'll recall State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the case. She reportedly had asked cops to stand down at the behest of Tina Tchen -- Michelle Obama's former Chief of Staff and a friend of Jussie's family. The conflict forced Foxx to bow out.
The Cook County State's Attorney's Office tells us the decision to drop all charges against Jussie was made by Joseph Magats -- the First Assistant State's Attorney -- who was placed in charge of the case after Foxx's recusal, and NOT by Foxx.
It's still odd. Sources tell TMZ the prosecutor in the case, as late as Friday afternoon, was making plans to handle issues involving cameras in the courtroom for the trial ... and seemed completely unaware of plans to drop the case.
9:22 AM PT -- Jussie and his lawyer, Patricia Holmes, just addressed the media, and the takeaway message was simple ... he's happy and wants to get on with his life. Holmes reiterated this was not a deal Jussie struck with prosecutors -- instead, they dropped the charges on their own, and he forfeited his bond voluntarily ... it wasn't a tit-for-tat situation.
Jussie thanked everyone who supported him through this case, and maintained he'd been truthful and consistent throughout the case. He added ... that he would never put the LGBTQ movement "through a fire like this." He also thanked his "Empire" cast members for their support.
If you're wondering if things will really get back to normal for Jussie -- he stopped to take a few selfies with fans on his way out of court.
And there's this ... federal law enforcement sources tell us Jussie is still under investigation for the threatening letter -- with racist and homophobic slurs -- that was sent to him at the "Empire" studio 8 days before the alleged attack.
You'll recall ... the Chicago PD Superintendent claimed Jussie sent it to himself, but our sources say the FBI had not reached that conclusion yet.
8:45 AM PT -- Jussie's family has also released a statement celebrating the news. They state, "This morning truth has prevailed and (Jussie) has been vindicated."
They continue, "While many were quick to rush to judgement before hearing the actual truth, we are grateful that the truth about Jussie has come to light. We look forward to bringing the real perpetrators to justice."
8:35 AM PT -- State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office says, "After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett's volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case."
The statement is consistent with what our sources said about Jussie only getting community service if he'd been convicted. The decision is NOT sitting well with Chicago PD.
On the other hand, Jussie's co-workers on "Empire" are celebrating on Twitter.
Jussie Smollett will not be prosecuted for allegedly faking a racial attack, because all charges have been dropped!!!
Jussie and his lawyers ran to court Tuesday morning in Chicago, where he was facing 16 felony counts of lying to police in the alleged racial and homophobic attack.
Jussie will surrender his $10,000 bond. But, that's it. The case is over.
We're told the State's Attorney, Kim Foxx, told Chicago police she was dropping the case because Jussie would have only gotten community service if convicted and she said he has already performed community service so there is no point in prosecuting him. We could not find any record of Smollett doing community service.
We're told Chicago police are "furious" and feel something untoward is going on with Kim Foxx.

Conor McGregor's Rep Slams Rape Arrest Report As 'Rumor' ... In Ireland Hotel
1
3/26/2019 12:42 PM PDT
Breaking News
12:42 PM PT -- Conor McGregor's spokesperson, Karen Kessler, has issued a statement ... referring to The NY Times report about the UFC star's arrest as a "rumor."
"This story has been circulating for some time and it is unclear why it is being reported now," Kessler said in a statement first published by ESPN.
Kessler also addresses people trying to connect Conor's retirement tweet to the report about his arrest.
"The assumption that the Conor retirement announcement today is related to this rumor is absolutely false."
And then, she added a shot at the UFC ...
"Should Conor fight in the future it must be in an environment where fighters are respected for their value, their skill, their hard work and their dedication to the sport."
We should note the statement does not directly address the sexual allegations described in The NY Times report.
Conor McGregor was arrested in January as part of a sexual assault investigation stemming from an alleged incident in December at a hotel in Dublin, Ireland ... this according to The NY Times.
McGregor was released from custody and has NOT been charged with a crime, according to the report. However, The NY Times says officials are still investigating the case.
Local media in Ireland have been covering the situation for months but without naming McGregor as the suspect because of laws that prevent news outlets from naming rape suspects unless they have been convicted.
The accuser is a woman in her 20s who claims she had been hanging with friends in South Dublin before ending up at the Beacon Hotel on Dec. 10.
After the alleged sexual assault, the woman went to police and filed a report -- and was then taken to a nearby hospital where she was treated in the Sexual Assault Treatment Unit, according to local reports.
Unclear if a rape kit was administered but it seems to be the standard operating procedure for women who are treated in this particular unit.
According to local reports, cops tried to obtain surveillance footage to see if they could place McGregor at the hotel at the time of the alleged incident.
When approached by the media back in December, a police spokesperson said, "[Cops] are investigating an alleged sexual assault on a female which occurred in Dublin 2 in the early hours of this morning, Monday December 10th 2018."
"No arrests have been made and investigations are continuing."
So far, McGregor has not commented on the allegations.
30-year-old Conor McGregor is no stranger to the law -- he was convicted of throwing a steel dolly at a UFC bus last year.
He was also in an Irish court last year over a 2017 speeding incident.

Jussie Smollett Allies Asked SA Kim Foxx to Intervene Leaked Texts, Emails Show
1
3/26/2019 12:09 PM PDT
Jussie Smollett had pals of his in the Cook County State's Attorney's ear early on in his case -- and, based on leaked correspondence, it looks like she acted on his behalf.
Texts and emails between State Attorney Kim Foxx and two Jussie allies -- one of which is reported to be a family member of his -- have been leaked, and they show that Foxx was asked to intervene in the case a few days after he'd reported the alleged attack to Chicago PD. It appears that she did exactly that ... and kept Jussie's camp in the loop.
The initial correspondence started when Michelle Obama's former chief of staff, Tina Tchen, emailed Foxx to say that she was reaching out on behalf of Jussie's family to express "concerns" they had with how the investigation at that point was being handled.
Jussie had not been charged with a crime yet, but it's believed Chicago PD was already doubting his story and leaking info to the press pushing that narrative.
Foxx responded to Tchen on Feb. 1, saying ... "Spoke to Superintendent Johnson. I convinced him to Reach out to FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. He is reaching out now and will get back to me shortly."
The same day, an unnamed relative of Jussie's texted Foxx herself, as well, and Foxx said she was working on getting the case sent over to the FBI. The relative replied, "Omg this would a huge victory." Foxx then responded, "I make no guarantees, but I'm trying."
Later, Foxx recused herself from the case when Jussie became a suspect. And, of course, her office just announced Tuesday that it was dropping all of the charges against Jussie, after coming out strong with a 16-count indictment just weeks earlier.
Her official reasoning for dropping the charges ... Jussie has done community service in the community, so we're good. Her office asked a judge to seal the case, and they obliged. Mayor Rahm Emanuel strongly hinted at corruption in the State's Attorney's Office.
The Chicago-Tribune first reported on the leaked texts and emails.
On the heels of all the charges being dropped against Jussie earlier Tuesday, the Fraternal Order of Police in Chicago is asking the Dept. of Justice to investigate Kim Foxx and her involvement in this case.

Anna Faris 'Sweet' Chris Gave Me a Heads-Up ... On Proposing to Katherine

3/26/2019 7:22 AM PDT
Anna Faris and Chris Pratt have so much respect for each other even after divorcing that he called her to let her know he'd be proposing to Katherine Schwarzenegger.
The actress made the revelation Monday on divorce attorney Laura Wasser's podcast, 'Divorce Sucks!' ... telling the Disso Queen Chris gave her a ring one day and bashfully said, "So, I’m going to ask Katherine to marry me. I just wanted to give you a heads-up."
Anna says she was ecstatic for her ex-hubby, reminding him that she's an ordained minister and could possibly marry them. We already knew Anna had floated that -- she told that story on her own podcast a couple months ago. Now, we know Chris reached out first.
But, check out Anna's description here of how she and Chris have navigated their lives post-divorce -- it's a great lesson in "conscious uncoupling" 101.
Chris and Anna finalized their divorce back in October, and the settlement includes a 5-mile rule in terms of living arrangements for the next five years.
They share one child together, young Jack.

Motley Crue & Netflix Sued I Got Electrocuted on Set of 'The Dirt'
1
3/26/2019 10:01 AM PDT
The crew member who was electrocuted on the set of Netflix's new Motley Crue movie is suing the band.
Louis DiVincenti just filed suit against the Crue and Netflix in Louisiana -- where filming for "The Dirt" took place, and where he suffered the electrocution. According to the suit, he says he was handing down metal pipes to other crew members, and one of the pipes made contact with a power line ... sending an electric current that "entered his body and blew out through his right foot."
DiVincenti says the March incident left him with third-degree burns on 50 percent of his body, and required a partial amputation on his foot ... as well as multiple surgeries and skin grafts.
In docs, obtained by TMZ, DiVincenti says Netflix and the producers -- which includes Tommy Lee and the rest of the band -- are on the hook for failing to address electrical hazards on set, and should be forced to pay for his suffering.
We broke the story ... DiVincenti had to be carried off in a stretcher at the time of the incident.
He's suing to get Netflix and Motley Crue to pay for the medical bills he's racked up, and for at least $1.8 million in damages.

Michael Avenatti Still Going After Nike After Arrest ... Names Deandre Ayton, Bol Bol
1
3/26/2019 7:25 AM PDT
Michael Avenatti is not lying low following his release from custody for allegedly extorting Nike -- instead, he's doubling down ... and throwing two huge basketball stars under the bus.
The lawyer just went on a Twitter attack against Nike, claiming the company has not been cooperating with a federal investigation into its Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) for over a year.
Avenatti adds ... "Unless you count lying in response to subpoenas and withholding documents as 'cooperating.' They are trying to divert attention from their own crimes."
The "divert attention" part is interesting -- Avenatti is implying his arrest Monday for allegedly trying to extort $20 million out of Nike in exchange for not announcing harmful allegations against the company is a distraction for its own crimes.
But then -- speaking of diverting attention -- Avenatti dropped a bombshell tweet accusing Nike of paying off 20-year-old PHX Suns star Deandre Ayton and his mom before he made it to the NBA. Ayton played college ball at the University of Arizona and was a highly recruited high school star before that.
Avenatti wrote ... "Ask DeAndre Ayton and Nike about the cash payments to his mother and others. Nike’s attempt at diversion and cover-up will fail miserably once prosecutors realize they have been played by Nike and their lawyers at Boies. This reaches the highest levels of Nike."
And there's more ... he's also calling out star Univ. of Oregon center Bol Bol, saying he and his handlers received large sums of cash from the shoe co.
Bol Bol and his handlers also received large sums from Nike. The receipts are clear as day. A lot of people at Nike will have to account for their criminal conduct, starting with Carlton DeBose & moving higher up. The diversion charade they orchestrated against me will be exposed
— Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) March 26, 2019
As we reported ... Avenatti was arrested Monday for an alleged extortion scheme prosecutors in NY say played out over the course of a few days last week. They claim Avenatti demanded payment from Nike to keep him quiet about allegedly paying families of some high school basketball players.
Avenatti is also facing more federal charges for bank and wire fraud in an unrelated case to the Nike one. The U.S. Attorney in the Central District of California claims Avenatti embezzled client money to cover expenses for his coffee corporation.
He was released Monday afternoon on $300k bond and held a press conference saying he's confident he'll be "fully exonerated."

9:53 AM PT -- NASA has just responded to the backlash, stating, "To clarify, we have more than 1 medium size spacesuit torso aboard, but to stay on schedule with @Space_Station upgrades, it's safer & faster to change spacewalker assignments than reconfigure spacesuits."
9:25 AM PT -- Hillary Clinton just weighed in on the situation, and her solution is pretty clear ... "Make another suit."
Make another suit. https://t.co/mu9w13xsi0
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 26, 2019
NASA's no better than your average department store -- lack of the right sizes in its women's department just screwed 2 astronauts out of making history with the first all-female spacewalk mission.
Turns out the space geniuses don't have enough spacesuits to fit female astronauts Christina Koch and Anne McClain ... who were scheduled to make a repair to the International Space Station's solar panels on Friday. NASA says it only has one medium-sized space shirt, and it's going to Koch ... although it's kind of a hand-me-down.
McClain used it last week during a spacewalk, which is when she discovered the bad fit. She originally planned to wear a large, but found the medium more to her liking. Since McClain wore it last, Koch is getting the nod this week.
NASA and all the astronauts agree the proper fit is critical to mission success ... still sucks to miss out on history. Perhaps worst of all, a man's taking McClain's place Friday.
Yes, even at around 220 miles above Earth ... there's a glass ceiling.
Note to President Trump: More fitting rooms for Space Force, please.

Kris Humphries Kim K Marriage 'Not Fake' ... Split Was Brutal

Breaking News
Kris Humphries is opening up about the most famous 72-day marriage of all time -- saying his relationship with Kim Kardashian was 100% real ... and he was genuinely "embarrassed" when they broke up.
The ex-NBA player spilled his guts about his coupling with Kim K in The Players' Tribune ... saying, "Look, I should have known what I was getting into."
Kris and Kim began dating in 2010 and got engaged in May 2011. They tied the knot August 20, 2011 ... and Kim filed for divorce on Oct. 31.
"I was definitely naive about how much my life was going to change," Kris says ... "But the one thing that really bothers me is whenever people say that my marriage was fake."
"There’s definitely a lot about that world that is not entirely real. But our actual relationship was 100% real."
Kris says "it sucked" when he realized the marriage wasn't working -- "It’s never easy to go through the embarrassment of something like that — with your friends, with your family."
"But when it plays out so publicly, in front of the world, it’s a whole other level. It was brutal."
Humphries -- now 34 years old and out of the NBA -- says he didn't know how to handle the negative attention stemming from his breakup ... admitting, "There was about a year where I was in a dark place."
Kris says he didn't want to leave his house and didn't even want to be known as Kris Humphries. Instead, Kris says he pretended to be Blake Griffin when he was out in public.
He also reflects about how much it sucked to be booed and taunted in the wake of the split -- wondering if fans were after him because they thought he was a wannabe reality star ... or because they thought he disrespected the game of basketball.
Humphries says he's not asking for pity -- and never really wanted to be famous -- claiming he's now trying to stay "under the radar" as he works on the next phase of his life.
So, what is Kris planning to do next? He's already opened up several restaurants -- 10 Five Guys burger joints and with plans to open 7 CRISP & GREEN eateries.

Michael Avenatti Indictment Casts Shadow On R. Kelly's Criminal Case
1
3/26/2019 7:10 AM PDT
EXCLUSIVE
Michael Avenatti's new legal woes -- being accused of extortion and fraud -- could derail the case against R. Kelly ... that's what the singer's lawyer thinks.
R. Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, tells TMZ ... now that Avenatti has been charged with extortion as well as bank and tax fraud, his credibility is now a centerpiece in the singer's case -- specifically, the circumstances surrounding how prosecutors obtained a key piece of evidence.
That evidence, of course, is a sex tape that Cook County investigators claim shows R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl, who's alleged to be 14 years old. It's what many believe to be a smoking gun against R. Kelly ... and the catalyst that led to a 10-count indictment.
Greenberg says the issue of "chain of custody" -- how Cook County got hold of that tape via Avenatti -- is now questionable. Greenberg strongly suggests the possibility the tape could've been altered before it got to prosecutors.
Sources connected to the case tell us that the man who handed the tape over to Avenatti is a whistle-blower who has a history of extorting R. Kelly.
We're told the man recently confessed to prosecutors in Chicago that he squeezed about a million dollars out of R. Kelly's team in the past to stop the tape from going public. So, the question ... if the guy got the cash, how would Avenatti have gotten it?
Remember, there were supposedly TWO R. Kelly sex tapes that Avenatti turned over to Cook County officials, but Greenberg tells us he's only aware of one.
Either way, if Greenberg can create reasonable doubt in the jury's mind as to authenticity ... he could get R. Kelly off. Hey, we've seen it happen before.

Ariana Grande Press Sours on Sweetener Tour's Photo Policy
1
3/26/2019 6:53 AM PDT
Ariana Grande is acting like a tyrant on her new tour ... at least, according to media organizations that are fuming over her photography policy.
Several major news outlets -- including the AP, New York Times, LA Times and 12 others -- have joined the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) in protesting Ariana's photo policy on her current Sweetener World Tour.
The NPPA claims the tour contract she's making them sign to cover her concerts requires photographers to hand over all rights to their photos to her tour company, GrandAriTour, Inc. ... and they're only allowed to take still shots from a designated area during the first 3 songs.
If the photogs want to use their pics, they have to get written approval from Grande ... and even then, they can only use each photo once as part of a news story.
The 16 media outlets believe this is a massive overreach and flies in the face of journalistic principles ... and the NPPA president is urging members to refuse to sign Ariana's photography agreement.
No word yet if the singer will change her tune.

Worst Trip to a TV Taping Ever
A chartered bus packed with Dr. Phil fans crashed in Hollywood today, after the driver says the brakes failed on the runaway vehicle. Get out of the way!
A spokesman for the L.A. City Fire Department says 19 people were taken to the hospital as a precaution, but there were no serious injuries.
A rep for "Dr. Phil" says the show chartered the bus to take fans to a taping of the show -- they never got there. All is not lost, however, as the rep said the show's producers planned to invite those on the bus back for lunch and to watch the taping of their 1,000th episode. "We're grateful that people are all right, and we hope that their next trip back to Dr. Phil will be less eventful and much more fun," the rep said. "His thoughts are with them."
"Dr. Phil" tapes on the Paramount lot in Hollywood, a short distance from where the bus crashed.

Russia Investigation
On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a report by directors of America’s leading intelligence agencies examining Russian activities in the 2016 election. One of their key conclusions was that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign with the goals of undermining public faith in the U.S. democratic process, harming the candidacy and weakening the potential presidency of Hillary Clinton, and boosting the candidacy of his preferred candidate Donald Trump.
Interference in America’s democracy and our electoral process by any outside power is unacceptable. Following the election, many Americans still have questions about the extent of Russian interference, including whether any individuals connected with the Trump campaign may have been involved with Russian efforts to sway the election.
As Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on intelligence, Senator Warner is leading, along with Committee Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Senate’s bipartisan investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He has said repeatedly that this is the most serious undertaking of his public life.
The dismissal of FBI Director Jim Comey, who was leading an active investigation into these matters, on May 9 makes it all the more imperative that Congress conduct an expeditious, thorough and bipartisan investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
This isn’t about re-litigating the results of the 2016 election. It’s about defending the United States from a foreign threat, holding the perpetrators responsible, and fighting back so that something like this never happens again.

How Venezuela’s economic crisis is undermining social science research — about everything
(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)
By Ryan Kennedy ,
Scott Clifford ,
Tyler Burleigh ,
Philip Waggoner and
Ryan Jewell
November 7, 2018
For social scientists, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) has been a gold mine, allowing rapid data collection for thousands of social science studies. This past summer, this gold mine seemed to be collapsing. Data quality appeared to have suddenly plummeted, with some researchers reporting high rates of inconsistent and even random responses. Until now, researchers have had to guess why.
By analyzing respondents’ IP addresses, we were able to identify one of the major culprits: respondents, many from Venezuela, using virtual private servers (VPSs) to fraudulently join studies. While the problem is not new, our analysis suggests that it may have spiked in the past several months, potentially undermining hundreds or even thousands of studies. We’ve developed tools to identify fraudulent respondents and to block them from future studies.
Here’s the background
MTurk is an Amazon online platform that allows people to recruit workers (called “Turkers”) from all over the world for brief paid tasks. (Amazon’s founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, also owns The Washington Post.) Researchers post a request. Turkers accept it, complete the task and are paid a small amount. While MTurk did not start as a platform for conducting social science surveys, researchers increasingly use it because they can rapidly recruit survey participants at a fraction of the cost of traditional platforms. MTurk offers a fairly diverse though still limited sample.
Early studies suggested that using Turkers resulted in similar- or better-quality data than laboratory studies, student samples and even costly survey firm panels. So it’s little surprise that searching Google Scholar turns up over 15,000 studies mentioning MTurk since 2014.
And so researchers panicked when, this past August, a University of Minnesota graduate student, Max Hui Bai, posted a query on a Facebook group for psychology researchers, asking whether anyone else had noticed a drop in data quality. In short: Yes, overwhelmingly so. Scholars from around the world reported abnormalities in their data: Respondents providing inconsistent responses to questions, nonsensical responses to open-ended questions and well-established experiments showing aberrant results. The discussion spread across social media, making it into New Scientist and Wired.
Some researchers suspected that the problems were coming from “bots” (computer code that automatically answers questions) or “cyborgs” (code that automatically answers some questions and has humans answer others). But soon three researchers — Sean A. Dennis, Brian M. Goodson and Chris Pearson — determined that international respondents were answering questions intended only for U.S. respondents. These “survey farmers” falsified data and used Virtual Private Servers (VPS) to make it seem as though they were answering questions from inside the United States. These respondents, some of whom did not speak English well, were more likely to give random responses. All this warped inferences about U.S. voting behavior, public opinion or cultural norms — and seriously, as at least one study found about 25 percent of its respondents were suspicious.
Here’s how we did our research
We conducted our own audit of 30 U.S. studies fielded on MTurk since 2013, encompassing 21,418 respondents. Using an IP traceback service (IP Hub), we found a severe spike in non-U.S. and VPS respondents since February 2018. This is bad news on two fronts. Not only did we find almost 25 percent of our respondents in a September 2018 study had come from a non-U.S. IP address or a VPS, but also that far more studies than previously thought may have been affected.
Percent of fraudulent respondents in MTurk surveys from 2013 to 2018
Of course, some U.S. respondents may use a VPS to protect their privacy or when they are traveling, rather than to fill out surveys fraudulently. To test how much VPS use is problematic, we fielded two new surveys, covering 2,010 respondents. In both surveys we found that VPS users failed more attention and quality checks than any other group, including those responding from a foreign IP address.
Some researchers suggest that the fraudulent respondents were based in India. We looked at the number of international respondents who apparently forgot to turn on their VPSs, allowing us to see from where they were connecting with the Internet. While a number of connections were from India, making up about 12 percent of the international IPs, even more — almost 18 percent — came from Venezuela.
We also combed online forums for MTurk users and found several Venezuelan Turkers who bragged about subverting the restrictions on international users.
We also combed online forums for MTurk users and found several Venezuelan Turkers who explained how they were able to get around Amazon controls. One thread, for example, discussed how a worker could have a relative in the U.S. set up an account for them to use; we’ve archived the thread here in case it’s removed.
All of this suggests that the MTurk crisis may have a surprising root. Venezuela’s economic crisis, with inflation heading toward 1 million percent. Some desperate Venezuelans are using online games to win virtual goods that they can sell for real money. Something similar seems to be happening on MTurk.
What can be done?
First, researchers must follow the standard best practices when conducting MTurk research. That includes setting the “HIT [an MTurk term for ‘task’] Approval Rate (%)” above 95 percent and the “Number of HITs Approved” to at least 100, which substantially improves data quality.
But that may not be sufficient. We recommend that scholars audit IP address metadata to identify international and VPS users. Researchers should warn workers that their IP location will be checked and that “farmers” may not be paid.
Our group has developed a software package, available on GitHub, CRAN or as an online app that enables MTurk researchers to audit their own data. We have also developed a Qualtrics protocol for screening out such respondents.
MTurk is too valuable to abandon. Many researchers, especially graduate students, cannot afford other options. But these measures should make a difference.
Correction: A previous version of this post interpreted a different Reddit poster as bragging about subverting MTurk controls using an address in Miami. He has since denied wrongdoing. We have removed the reference, and we regret the error.

Jim Carrey Reacts After Mueller Report Summary Is Released: 'Today We Eat Crow'
Jim Carrey had a hearty helping of crow on Monday - though it appeared that he enjoyed it with a side of sarcasm, and perhaps washed it down with a bit of optimism.Actor-artist Carrey unveiled his latest political cartoon via Twitter on Monday, after Attorney General William Barr submitted his summary of the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller.In his new work, Carrey declared, “Today we eat crow.”He added, “Trump’s goose will be slow- cooked.”In his summary, Barr said that Mueller found no evidence that President Donald Trump or members of his 2016 presidential campaign conspired with Russia to sway the election, and he reached no conclusion on the investigation into obstruction of justice.Carrey’s cartoon depicted a man, presumably Carrey himself, sitting down at a dining table festooned with black feathers while ordering up more crow.In a message accompanying the artwork, Carrey wrote, “Wow! How could I be so wrong abt this President?! “Also Read: Jim Carrey Depicts an Apocalyptic Trump Presidency and 40 More of His Politically Charged Artworks (Photos)He continued, “The fact tht [sic] Barr let him skate on OBSTRUCTION, even after confessing on NATIONAL TV, proves Potus is 100% above reproach! Orrrrr…he, like Gotti, slipped the noose again.”On Friday, after Mueller submitted his report, Carrey took aim at Barr with a cartoon portrait.Of that work, Carrey wrote, “The Mueller report is out! The question now is…how low will this Barr go?”Also Read: Jim Carrey Digs Into 'Crypt Keeper' Kellyanne Conway's Marriage in Latest Political CartoonSee Carrey’s latest below.Wow!
